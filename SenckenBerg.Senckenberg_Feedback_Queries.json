  "response": " Based on the context provided, there is no direct information on designing a self-cleaning surface for outdoor equipment that repels dirt and water effectively. However, from the context, we can infer some potential factors that could contribute to such a design:\n1. Hydrophobicity: The ability of a surface to repel water can be achieved through hydrophobic coatings that cause water to form droplets and roll off quickly. This property has been studied extensively in the context of leaves and rainwater, as discussed in one of the titles.\n2. Superhydrophobicity: A more advanced version of hydrophobicity is superhydrophobicity, which causes water to form spherical droplets and roll off even easier than with hydrophobic coatings. This property has been observed in some natural materials, such as lotus leaves, and could potentially be applied to outdoor equipment surfaces.\n3. Self-cleaning: The ability of a surface to repel dirt can be achieved through self-cleaning properties, such as superhydrophilic surfaces that cause water to spread evenly and wash away dirt particles or photocatalytic surfaces that use sunlight to decompose organic matter.\n4. Biofouling resistance: To prevent the growth of non-indigenous species on outdoor equipment surfaces, as discussed in one of the titles, could be achieved through antifouling coatings or materials with low surface energy that make it difficult for organisms to attach and grow.\n5. Durability: The self-cleaning surface should be able to withstand outdoor conditions, such as sunlight, rain, wind, and potential impact from objects, without degrading over time.\nDesigning a self-cleaning surface for outdoor equipment that repels dirt and water effectively would involve researching and developing coatings or materials that combine the above properties in a durable and cost-effective way. It could also involve studying natural surfaces with similar properties and adapting their structures or compositions for practical applications.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the Mediterranean being both a hotspot for recreational boating and for non-indigenous species (NIS), no data currently exists on the recreational boating sector's contribution to the spread of NIS in this Sea. To improve the basis for management decisions, a wide-scale sampling study on the biofouling communities of recreational vessels and marinas was undertaken. Specifically, we surveyed over 600 boat owners and sampled the same boat hulls for NIS in 25 marinas across the Mediterranean, from France to Cyprus, to determine which factors (i.e. boat characteristics, travel behaviour, home marina) are associated with higher NIS richness on boat hulls. Among the surveyed boats, we found recreational vessels to travel considerably, averaging 67 travel days and 7.5 visited marinas per annum. This results in a high potential for spreading NIS, especially as 71% of sampled vessels host at least one (and up to 11) NIS. Boats with high NIS richness strongly correlate with home marinas with high NIS richness. Over half of the vessels were carriers of NIS which were not yet present in the marinas they were visiting. The presence of biofouling in niche areas of the hull (i.e. in the cavities and metallic parts) emerges as the best predictor for NIS richness on boats, along with longer times since their last cleaning and antifouling applications. Interestingly, colonization of NIS occurred rapidly, even on boats that had recently had their hulls cleaned professionally. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that recreational boating has a very high capacity for the spread of non-indigenous species (NIS) in the Mediterranean, due to both high NIS richness on boats and extensive travel. To counteract the spread of NIS, routine monitoring for new NIS needs to be established for both marinas and vessels, along with frequent pontoon cleaning. Additionally, policy should require preliminary screenings for incoming vessels from new countries, especially those emanating from high-risk marinas. The niche areas of the boat hulls should be checked first for biofouling, which was the best predictor for NIS richness since they often go overlooked with in-water cleanings are rarely have antifouling applied to them. © 2019 The Authors.

        "Authors": "Roth-Nebelsick A.; Konrad W.; Ebner M.; Miranda T.; Thielen S.; Nebelsick J.H.",
        "Abstract": "Raindrop impact on leaves is a common event which is of relevance for numerous processes, including the dispersal of pathogens and propagules, leaf wax erosion, gas exchange, leaf water absorption, and interception and storage of rainwater by canopies. The process of drop impact is complex, and its outcome depends on many influential factors. The wettability of plants has been recognized as an important parameter which is itself complex and difficult to determine for leaf surfaces. Other important parameters include leaf inclination angle and the ability of leaves to respond elastically to drop impact. Different elastic motions are initiated by drop impact, including local deformation, flapping, torsion, and bending, as well as 'swinging' of the petiole. These elastic responses, which occur on different time scales, can affect drop impact directly or indirectly, by changing the leaf inclination. An important feature of drop impact is splashing, meaning the fragmentation of the drop with ejection of satellite droplets. This process is promoted by the kinetic energy of the drop and leaf traits. For instance, a dense trichome cover can suppress splashing. Basic drop impact patterns are presented and discussed for a number of different leaf types, as well as some exemplary mosses.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

        "Abstract": "Plastics are ubiquitous in our daily life. Large quantities of plastics leak in the environment where they weather and fragment into micro- and nanoparticles. This potentially releases additives, but rarely leads to a complete mineralization, thus constitutes an environmental hazard. Plastic pollution in agricultural soils currently represents a major challenge: quantitative data of nanoplastics in soils as well as their effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functions need more attention. Plastic accumulation interferes with soil functions, including water dynamics, aeration, microbial activities, and nutrient cycling processes, thus impairing agricultural crop yield. Plastic debris directly affects living organisms but also acts as contaminant vectors in the soils, increasing the effects and the threats on biodiversity. Finally, the effects of plastics on terrestrial invertebrates, representing major taxa in abundance and diversity in the soil compartment, need urgently more investigation from the infra-individual to the ecosystem scales. © 2024 The Authors"

        "Abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii appears as an often multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen in hospitals worldwide. Its remarkable persistence in the hospital environment is probably due to intrinsic and acquired resistance to disinfectants and antibiotics, tolerance to desiccation stress, capability to form biofilms, and is possibly facilitated by surface-associated motility. Our attempts to elucidate surface-associated motility in A. baumannii revealed a mutant inactivated in a putative DNA-(adenine N6)-methyltransferase, designated A1S_0222 in strain ATCC 17978. We recombinantly produced A1S_0222 as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein and purified it to near homogeneity through a combination of GST affinity chromatography, cation exchange chromatography and PD-10 desalting column. Furthermore we demonstrate A1S_0222-dependent adenine methylation at a GAATTC site. We propose the name AamA (Acinetobacter adenine methyltransferase A) in addition to the formal names M.AbaBGORF222P/M.Aba17978ORF8565P. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) revealed that the protein is monomeric and has an extended and likely two-domain shape in solution. © 2018 Elsevier Inc."

The mean flow velocity in this layer above the crest, transformed into friction velocity by means of the surface skin roughness, is shown to give values consistent with measured values. The resulting dimensionless shear stress due to skin friction is depth-independent, in contrast to that derived by means of often cited traditional methods. As a result of the relationship between dune height and the thickness of the near-bed layer, an expression for the expansion loss behind dunes was formulated and used to relate form resistance directly to dune height. © 2009 Springer-Verlag."

        "Abstract": "Technology is transforming societies worldwide. A major innovation is the emergence of robotics and autonomous systems (RAS), which have the potential to revolutionize cities for both people and nature. Nonetheless, the opportunities and challenges associated with RAS for urban ecosystems have yet to be considered systematically. Here, we report the findings of an online horizon scan involving 170 expert participants from 35 countries. We conclude that RAS are likely to transform land use, transport systems and human–nature interactions. The prioritized opportunities were primarily centred on the deployment of RAS for the monitoring and management of biodiversity and ecosystems. Fewer challenges were prioritized. Those that were emphasized concerns surrounding waste from unrecovered RAS, and the quality and interpretation of RAS-collected data. Although the future impacts of RAS for urban ecosystems are difficult to predict, examining potentially important developments early is essential if we are to avoid detrimental consequences but fully realize the benefits. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."

        "Abstract": "Transdisciplinary sustainability research aims to mitigate or to solve complex societal problems and advance the production of scientific knowledge. Reflexive approaches to transdisciplinary research processes are outlined to systematically strengthen the potential for societal effectiveness. So far, it is rare to find empirically based analyses of the links between the quality of the research process and the methods applied on the one hand and the effects achieved on the other. This paper thus addresses the issue of heightening the societal effects of transdisciplinary sustainability research. The objective is to explore ways of consciously promoting societal effectiveness in transdisciplinary research. We argue that these possibilities evolve at the intersection between the general project framework and an adaptive shaping of transdisciplinary research processes. A reflexive approach of this kind proactively considers the dynamics of interests and concerns, roles and responsibilities, the collaboration culture within a project, and the connectivity to the context of action addressed. Its deployment presupposes an appreciation of the basic conditions, i.e. the historical development of the respective problem, the heterogeneity of actors involved, the general environment and, finally, the funding conditions. © 2019 The Authors"

        "Authors": "Karakostis F.A.; Lorenzo C.",
        "Abstract": "Objectives: This study aimed to put forth a new and precise methodology for calculating the 3D areas of hand entheses. Furthermore, it investigated some of the factors affecting hand entheses development through an assessment of their correlations and morphometric patterns. Materials and methods: Fifty individuals from late-medieval San Pablo were studied. The sample consisted of high-definition 3D models of 17 entheses from the first, second, and fifth hand rays. A new methodology was introduced for quantifying their areas. Precision was verified using intraobserved and interobserver tests. Both raw and relative entheseal size (ratio of entheseal size to total bone surface size) were calculated. Bivariate analyses assessed the effect of age-group on entheses as well as the correlations across entheses of muscles that act synergistically, bone length, and articular surface size. The morphometric patterns among hand entheses were explored using a multivariate analysis. Results: The methodology presented no significant error. Age-group variation does not seem to affect hand entheses. In relative size, only particular pairs presented significant association and the entheses involved were not correlated with bone length or articular surface size. The multivariate analysis demonstrated high sexual dimorphism in overall entheseal size as well as two morphometric trends among hand entheses. Discussion: The proposed methodology can set the basis for further morphological 3D analysis of entheses. If biomechanical stress affects hand entheses, its impact would possibly be greater on their relative size. The morphometric patterns among entheses seem to reflect the performance of prehensile grips. Am J Phys Anthropol 160:694–707, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Histology of spiculated sponge tissue represents a challenging problem in sponge histotechnology.

For a broad range of siliceous sponge species, we developed and evaluated methods for embedding in paraffin, methylmethacrylate resins, LR White resin and cryomatrix. Different methods for cutting tissue blocks as well as mounting and staining sections also were tested. Our aim was to enable histological investigations and FISH without prior removal of the spicules. To obtain an overview of tissue and skeleton arrangement, we recommend embedding tissue blocks with LR White resin combined with en bloc staining techniques for large specimens with thick and numerous spicules, but paraffin embedding and subsequent staining for whole small specimens. For FISH on siliceous sponges, we recommend Histocryl embedding if the spicule content is high, but paraffin embedding if it is low. Classical histological techniques are used for detailed tissue examinations."

  "response": " Based on the context provided, there is no direct connection to the query about designing a reusable fastening system. However, the information about the intertarsal joint of the ostrich mentions a passive engage-disengage mechanism (EDM) that establishes joint extension, provides bi-directional resistance, and contributes to rapid intertarsal flexion at toe off and full extension prior to touch down. While this is not directly related to fastening fabric materials, it might be worth exploring the concept of passive mechanisms in designing a reusable fastening system. These could include hooks and loops, Velcro-like attachments, or other designs that utilize natural principles to securely attach and detach materials without requiring active muscle control or external energy input. Further research and experimentation would be necessary to determine if this approach would meet the design requirements of a quick and secure fastening system for fabric materials.",

The silk adheres to various substrates underwater and has high tensile strength, extensibility, and toughness and is of interest as a model for biomimetic adhesives. As a step toward understanding how the properties of underwater silk evolved in Trichoptera, we used genomic data to identify full-length sequences and characterize the primary structure of the major silk protein, h-fibroin, across the order. The h-fibroins have conserved termini and basic motif structure with high variation in repeating modules and variation in the percentage of amino acids, mainly proline. This finding might be linked to differences in mechanical properties related to the different silk usage and sets a starting point for future studies to screen and correlate amino acid motifs and other sequence features with quantifiable silk properties. © 2023 The Author(s)"

        "Abstract": "Objectives: In anthropological sciences, entheses are widely utilized as occupational stress markers. However, the reaction of entheseal surfaces to mechanical loading is not well understood. Furthermore, previous studies on entheses relied on the individuals' occupation-at-death. Past research by one of us has identified two patterns among hand entheses, proposing that they reflect two synergistic muscle groups. Here, we investigate the association between these patterns and habitual manual activity using an extensively documented skeletal sample and a three-dimensional system of quantification. Materials and Methods: The hand bones utilized belong to 45 individuals from mid-19th century Basel. These were male adults (18 to 48 years old) who were not directly related, showed no manual pathological conditions, and whose occupational activities during their lifetime were clearly documented and could be evaluated according to historical sources. The patterns of entheses were explored using principal component analysis on both raw and size-adjusted variables. The influence of age-at-death, body mass, and bone length was assessed through correlation tests. Results: The analysis showed that the previously proposed patterns of entheses are present in our sample. Individuals with the same or comparable occupations presented similar entheseal patterns. These results were not considerably affected by entheseal overall size, age-at-death, body mass, or bone length. Discussion: Individuals involved in intense manual labor during their lifetime presented a distinctive pattern of hand entheses, consistent with the application of high grip force. By contrast, individuals with less strenuous and/or highly mechanized occupations showed an entheseal pattern related to the thumb intrinsic muscles. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

        "Abstract": "The divergence of sister orders Trichoptera (caddisflies) and Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) from a silk-spinning ancestor occurred around 290 million years ago. Trichoptera larvae are mainly aquatic, and Lepidoptera larvae are almost entirely terrestrial—distinct habitats that required molecular adaptation of their silk for deployment in water and air, respectively. The major protein components of their silks are heavy chain and light chain fibroins. In an effort to identify molecular changes in L-fibroins that may have contributed to the divergent use of silk in water and air, we used the ColabFold implementation of AlphaFold2 to predict three-dimensional structures of L-fibroins from both orders. A comparison of the structures revealed that despite the ancient divergence, profoundly different habitats, and low sequence conservation, a novel 10-helix core structure was strongly conserved in L-fibroins from both orders. Previously known intra- and intermolecular disulfide linkages were accurately predicted. Structural variations outside of the core may represent molecular changes that contributed to the evolution of insect silks adapted to water or air. The distributions of electrostatic potential, for example, were not conserved and present distinct order-specific surfaces for potential interactions with or modulation by external factors. Additionally, the interactions of L-fibroins with the H-fibroin C-termini are different for these orders; lepidopteran L-fibroins have N-terminal insertions that are not present in trichopteran L-fibroins, which form an unstructured ribbon in isolation but become part of an intermolecular β-sheet when folded with their corresponding H-fibroin C-termini. The results are an example of protein structure prediction from deep sequence data of understudied proteins made possible by AlphaFold2. © 2022 by the authors."

        "Abstract": "The ostrich (Struthio camelus) is the largest extant biped. Being flightless, it exhibits advanced cursorial abilities primarily evident in its characteristic speed and endurance. In addition to the active musculoskeletal complex, its powerful pelvic limbs incorporate passive structures wherein ligaments interact with joint surfaces, cartilage and other connective tissue in their course of motion. This arrangement may enable energy conservation by providing joint stabilisation, optimised limb segment orientation and automated positioning of ground contact elements independently of direct muscle control. The intertarsal joint is of particular interest considering its position near the mid-point of the extended limb and its exposure to high load during stance with significant inertial forces during swing phase. Functional-anatomical analysis of the dissected isolated joint describes the interaction of ligaments with intertarsal joint contours through the full motion cycle. Manual manipulation identified a passive engage-disengage mechanism (EDM) that establishes joint extension, provides bi-directional resistance prior to a transition point located at 115° and contributes to rapid intertarsal flexion at toe off and full extension prior to touch down. This effect was subsequently quantified by measurement of intertarsal joint moments in prepared anatomical specimens in a neutral horizontal position and axially-loaded vertical position. Correlation with kinematic analyses of walking and running ostriches confirms the contribution of the EDM in vivo. We hypothesise that the passive EDM operates in tandem with a stringently coupled multi-jointed muscle-tendon system to conserve the metabolic cost of locomotion in the ostrich, suggesting that a complete understanding of terrestrial locomotion across extinct and extant taxa must include functional consideration of the ligamentous system. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland."

Here, we established a cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) pipeline for the rapid and inexpensive production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) directly from DNA templates. To validate our platform, we used deep learning to design thousands of AMPs de novo. Using computational methods, we prioritized 500 candidates that we produced and screened with our CFPS pipeline. We identified 30 functional AMPs, which we characterized further through molecular dynamics simulations, antimicrobial activity and toxicity. Notably, six de novo-AMPs feature broad-spectrum activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens and do not develop bacterial resistance.

        "Abstract": "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the method of virtually and physically reconstructing the missing part of a badly damaged medieval skull by means of reverse engineering, computer-aided design (CAD) and rapid prototyping (RP) techniques. Design/methodology/approach - Laser scanning data were used to create the 3D model of the damaged skull. Starting from this digital model, a virtual reconstruction of the missing part of the skull, based on the ideal symmetry with respect to the mid-sagittal plane, was achieved in a CAD environment. Finally, the custom-designed model was directly fabricated by means of the RP process. Findings - The result shows that the designed missing part of the skull fits very well with the existing skeletal remains. The final physical assembly of the prototyped element on the damaged skull was tested, restoring it to its whole original shape. Research limitations/implications - The entire process was time-consuming and may be applied just to the most representative skeletal remains. Practical implications - The method allows accurate fabrication of the missing part of the skull to be joined with the original skeletal remains. The advantage of using this technique is that the joining operation can be carried out without any need of supplementary connecting material, such as glue or plaster, to fix together the two parts. Originality/value - The reversible and non-invasive method improves the restoration process, reduces the risk of damage to the skeletal structure and allows reversion to the original repair as it was before. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

        "Abstract": "The issue of reconstructing lost or deformed bone presents an equal challenge in the fields of paleoanthropology, bioarchaeology, forensics, and medicine. Particularly, within the disciplines of orthodontics and surgery, the main goal of reconstruction is to restore or create ex novo the proper form and function. The reconstruction of the mandibular condyle requires restoration of articulation, occlusion, and mastication from the functional side as well as the correct shape of the mandible from the esthetic point of view. Meeting all these demands is still problematic for surgeons. It is unfortunate that the collaboration between anthropologists and medical professionals is still limited. Nowadays, geometric morphometric methods (GMM) are routinely applied in shape analysis and increasingly in the reconstruction of missing data in skeletal material in paleoanthropology. Together with methods for three-dimensional (3D) digital model construction and reverse engineering, these methods could prove to be useful in surgical fields for virtual planning of operations and the production of customized biocompatible scaffolds. In this contribution, we have reconstructed the missing left condylar process of the mandible belonging to a famous Italian humanist of the 15th century, Pico della Mirandola (1463-1494) by means of 3D digital models and GMM, having first compared two methods (a simple reflection of the opposite side and the mathematical-statistical GMM approach) in a complete human mandible on which loss of the left condyle was virtually simulated. Finally, stereolithographic models of Pico's skull were prototyped providing the physical assembly of the bony skull structures with a high fitting accuracy. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

        "Abstract": "Reconstruction of fractured, distorted, or missing parts in human skeleton presents an equal challenge in the fields of paleoanthropology, bioarcheology, forensics, and medicine. This is particularly important within the disciplines such as orthodontics and surgery, when dealing with mandibular defects due to tumors, developmental abnormalities, or trauma. In such cases, proper restorations of both form (for esthetic purposes) and function (restoration of articulation, occlusion, and mastication) are required. Several digital approaches based on three-dimensional (3D) digital modeling, computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing techniques, and more recently geometric morphometric methods have been used to solve this problem. Nevertheless, comparisons among their outcomes are rarely provided. In this contribution, three methods for hemimandibular body reconstruction have been tested. Two bone defects were virtually simulated in a 3D digital model of a human hemimandible. Accordingly, 3D digital scaffolds were obtained using the mirror copy of the unaffected hemimandible (Method 1), the thin plate spline (TPS) interpolation (Method 2), and the combination between TPS and CAD techniques (Method 3). The mirror copy of the unaffected hemimandible does not provide a suitable solution for bone restoration. The combination between TPS interpolation and CAD techniques (Method 3) produces an almost perfect-fitting 3D digital model that can be used for biocompatible custom-made scaffolds generated by rapid prototyping technologies. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Similarly, in your query, you're looking to design clothing that can adaptively transfer heat based on varying ambient temperatures.\n\nAnother connection can be drawn from the third context title, which discusses the constraints on arthropod populations adapting to climatic warming due to changes in peak performance temperature for various life-history traits.

        "Abstract": "The extent to which different kinds of organisms have adapted to environmental temperature regimes is central to understanding how they respond to climate change. The Scholander-Irving (S-I) model of heat transfer lays the foundation for explaining how endothermic birds and mammals maintain their high, relatively constant body temperatures in the face of wide variation in environmental temperature. The S-I model shows how body temperature is regulated by balancing the rates of heat production and heat loss. Both rates scale with body size, suggesting that larger animals should be better adapted to cold environments than smaller animals, and vice versa. However, the global distributions of ∼ 9,000 species of terrestrial birds and mammals show that the entire range of body sizes occurs in nearly all climatic regimes. Using physiological and environmental temperature data for 211 bird and 178 mammal species, we test for mass-independent adaptive changes in two key parameters of the S-I model: basal metabolic rate (BMR) and thermal conductance. We derive an axis of thermal adaptation that is independent of body size, extends the S-I model, and highlights interactions among physiological and morphological traits that allow endotherms to persist in a wide range of temperatures. Our macrophysiological and macroecological analyses support our predictions that shifts in BMR and thermal conductance confer important adaptations to environmental temperature in both birds and mammals."

        "Abstract": "The relationships among species' physiological capacities and the geographical variation of ambient climate are of key importance to understanding the distribution of life on the Earth. Furthermore, predictions of how species will respond to climate change will profit from the explicit consideration of their physiological tolerances. The climatic variability hypothesis, which predicts that climatic tolerances are broader in more variable climates, provides an analytical framework for studying these relationships between physiology and biogeography. However, direct empirical support for the hypothesis is mostly lacking for endotherms, and few studies have tried to integrate physiological data into assessments of species' climatic vulnerability at the global scale. Here, we test the climatic variability hypothesis for endotherms, with a comprehensive dataset on thermal tolerances derived from physiological experiments, and use these data to assess the vulnerability of species to projected climate change. We find the expected relationship between thermal tolerance and ambient climatic variability in birds, but not in mammals-a contrast possibly resulting from different adaptation strategies to ambient climate via behaviour, morphology or physiology. We show that currently most of the species are experiencing ambient temperatures well within their tolerance limits and that in the future many species may be able to tolerate projected temperature increases across significant proportions of their distributions. However, our findings also underline the high vulnerability of tropical regions to changes in temperature and other threats of anthropogenic global changes. Our study demonstrates that a better understanding of the interplay among species' physiology and the geography of climate change will advance assessments of species' vulnerability to climate change. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

        "Abstract": "The capacity of arthropod populations to adapt to long-term climatic warming is currently uncertain. Here we combine theory and extensive data to show that the rate of their thermal adaptation to climatic warming will be constrained in two fundamental ways. First, the rate of thermal adaptation of an arthropod population is predicted to be limited by changes in the temperatures at which the performance of four key life-history traits can peak, in a specific order of declining importance: juvenile development, adult fecundity, juvenile mortality and adult mortality. Second, directional thermal adaptation is constrained due to differences in the temperature of the peak performance of these four traits, with these differences expected to persist because of energetic allocation and life-history trade-offs. We compile a new global dataset of 61 diverse arthropod species which provides strong empirical evidence to support these predictions, demonstrating that contemporary populations have indeed evolved under these constraints. Our results provide a basis for using relatively feasible trait measurements to predict the adaptive capacity of diverse arthropod populations to geographic temperature gradients, as well as ongoing and future climatic warming. © The Author(s) 2024."

A recurrent pattern of temperature-induced adaptive plasticity includes increased heat tolerance after exposure to warmer temperatures and increased cold tolerance after exposure to cooler temperatures. However, the mechanisms underlying these plastic responses are hitherto not well understood. Therefore, we here investigate effects of adult acclimation on gene expression in the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana, using an RNAseq approach. Results: We show that several antioxidant markers (e.g. peroxidase, cytochrome P450) were up-regulated at a higher temperature compared with a lower adult temperature, which might play an important role in the acclamatory responses subsequently providing increased heat tolerance. Furthermore, several metabolic pathways were up-regulated at the higher temperature, likely reflecting increased metabolic rates. In contrast, we found no evidence for a decisive role of the heat shock response. Conclusions: Although the important role of antioxidant defence mechanisms in alleviating detrimental effects of oxidative stress is firmly established, we speculate that its potentially important role in mediating heat tolerance and survival under stress has been underestimated thus far and thus deserves more attention. © 2019 The Author(s)."

        "Abstract": "This book provides practical information about web archives, offers inspiring examples for web archivists, raises new challenges, and shares recent research results about access methods to explore information from the past preserved by web archives. The book is structured in six parts. Part 1 advocates for the importance of web archives to preserve our collective memory in the digital era, demonstrates the problem of web ephemera and shows how web archiving activities have been trying to address this challenge. Part 2 then focuses on different strategies for selecting web content to be preserved and on the media types that different web archives host. It provides an overview of efforts to address the preservation of web content as well as smaller-scale but high-quality collections of social media or audiovisual content. Next, Part 3 presents examples of initiatives to improve access to archived web information and provides an overview of access mechanisms for web archives designed to be used by humans or automatically accessed by machines. Part 4 presents research use cases for web archives. It also discusses how to engage more researchers in exploiting web archives and provides inspiring research studies performed using the exploration of web archives. Subsequently, Part 5 demonstrates that web archives should become crucial infrastructures for modern connected societies. It makes the case for developing web archives as research infrastructures and presents several inspiring examples of added-value services built on web archives. Lastly, Part 6 reflects on the evolution of the web and the sustainability of web archiving activities. It debates the requirements and challenges for web archives if they are to assume the responsibility of being societal infrastructures that enable the preservation of memory. This book targets academics and advanced professionals in a broad range of research areas such as digital humanities, social sciences, history, media studies and information or computer science. It also aims to fill the need for a scholarly overview to support lecturers who would like to introduce web archiving into their courses by offering an initial reference for students. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

Our framework provides conceptual guidelines for combining paleontological and neontological perspectives to unravel the fundamental processes shaping life on Earth. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

        "Abstract": "Conservation of species and ecosystems is increasingly difficult because anthropogenic impacts are pervasive and accelerating. Under this rapid global change, maximizing conservation success requires a paradigm shift from maintaining ecosystems in idealized past states toward facilitating their adaptive and functional capacities, even as species ebb and flow individually. Developing effective strategies under this new paradigm will require deeper understanding of the long-term dynamics that govern ecosystem persistence and reconciliation of conflicts among approaches to conserving historical versus novel ecosystems. Integrating emerging information from conservation biology, paleobiology, and the Earth sciences is an important step forward on the path to success.

The method goes beyond classical interpretation of pollen records by considering the vegetation as a whole and using the intrinsic similarity in the dynamics of the different regional vegetation elements.

        "Abstract": "Despite the Mediterranean being both a hotspot for recreational boating and for non-indigenous species (NIS), no data currently exists on the recreational boating sector's contribution to the spread of NIS in this Sea. To improve the basis for management decisions, a wide-scale sampling study on the biofouling communities of recreational vessels and marinas was undertaken. Specifically, we surveyed over 600 boat owners and sampled the same boat hulls for NIS in 25 marinas across the Mediterranean, from France to Cyprus, to determine which factors (i.e. boat characteristics, travel behaviour, home marina) are associated with higher NIS richness on boat hulls. Among the surveyed boats, we found recreational vessels to travel considerably, averaging 67 travel days and 7.5 visited marinas per annum. This results in a high potential for spreading NIS, especially as 71% of sampled vessels host at least one (and up to 11) NIS. Boats with high NIS richness strongly correlate with home marinas with high NIS richness. Over half of the vessels were carriers of NIS which were not yet present in the marinas they were visiting. The presence of biofouling in niche areas of the hull (i.e. in the cavities and metallic parts) emerges as the best predictor for NIS richness on boats, along with longer times since their last cleaning and antifouling applications. Interestingly, colonization of NIS occurred rapidly, even on boats that had recently had their hulls cleaned professionally. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that recreational boating has a very high capacity for the spread of non-indigenous species (NIS) in the Mediterranean, due to both high NIS richness on boats and extensive travel. To counteract the spread of NIS, routine monitoring for new NIS needs to be established for both marinas and vessels, along with frequent pontoon cleaning. Additionally, policy should require preliminary screenings for incoming vessels from new countries, especially those emanating from high-risk marinas. The niche areas of the boat hulls should be checked first for biofouling, which was the best predictor for NIS richness since they often go overlooked with in-water cleanings are rarely have antifouling applied to them. © 2019 The Authors.

        "Abstract": "Microscopic organisms that penetrate calcareous structures by actively dissolving the carbonate matrix, namely microendoliths, have an important influence on the breakdown of marine carbonates. The study of these microorganisms and the bioerosion traces they produce is crucial for understanding the impact of their bioeroding activity on the carbonate recycling in environments under global climate change. Traditionally, either the extracted microendoliths were studied by conventional microscopy or their traces were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of epoxy resin casts. A visualisation of the microendoliths in situ, that is within their complex microbioerosion structures, was previously limited to the laborious and time-consuming double-inclusion cast-embedding technique. Here, we assess the applicability of various fluorescence staining methods in combination with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) for the study of fungal microendoliths in situ in partly translucent mollusc shells. Among the tested methods, specific staining with dyes against the DNA (nuclei) of the trace making organisms turned out to be a useful and reproducible approach. Bright and clearly delineated fluorescence signals of microendolithic nuclei allow, for instance, a differentiation between abandoned and still populated microborings. Furthermore, infiltrating the microborings with fluorescently stained resin seems to be of great capability for the visualisation and quantification of microbioerosion structures in their original spatial orientation. Potential fields of application are rapid assessments of endolithic bio- and ichnodiversity and the quantification of the impact of microendoliths on the overall calcium carbonate turnover. The method can be applied after CLSM of the stained microendoliths and retains the opportunity for a subsequent investigation of epoxy casts with SEM. This allows a three-fold approach in studying microendoliths in the context of their microborings, thereby fostering the integration of biological and ichnological aspects of microbial bioerosion. © 2021 The Authors.

It has been declining for at least the past decade. This is probably due to two measures. First, regulations prohibiting the use of TBT-based paints on small boats and fish farms have reduced inputs of TBT from these sources so that they are now negligible (except possibly where the regulations are flaunted). Second, there is evidence from sites, where commercial vessels are the sole source of TBT, that the adoption of TBT SPC paints has been effective in reducing environmental levels of these contaminants. However, poor dockyard practices, allowing TBT-contaminated wastes, including paint flakes, to accumulate in sediments have left a legacy of hot-spots of contamination in some ports. The impact is localised so that TBT contamination is low in coastal areas immediately adjacent to ports. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rigths reserved."

        "Abstract": "This paper summarizes studies of sedimentary surface structures in which microbial mats play a role. Intertidal/supratidal transitions of tidal flats of the North Sea coast, and shallow hypersaline water bodies of salterns (Bretagne, Canary and Balearic Islands), and Gavish Sabkha (Sinai) reveal a multitude of sedimentary surface structures which can be grouped and primary biologically controlled structures. Physically controlled surface structures include shrinkage cracks, erosion marks, deformation structures caused by water friction, gas pressure and mineral encrustation. Shrinkage cracks in microbial mats reveal the following features: (i) horizontally arranged cauliflower pattern that differs from the usually orthogonally regular crack morphology in clay, (ii) rounded edges and pillow-like thickening along the crack edges, caused by the growth of mats into the cracks. Criteria of erosion are pocket-like depressions and ripple marks on the thus exposed non-stabilized sand, and residual stacks of microbial mats. Deformation structures are due to water friction causing flotation of loosely attached microbial mats which fold and tear. Gas migration from deeper layers causes domal upheaval, protuberance structures, folds and \"fairy rings\". Protuberance structures are caused by the rupture of gas domes and rapid escape of the enclosed gas. The sudden drop of pressure forces sediment to well up from below through the gas channels and to fill the internal hollow spaces of the domes. \"Fairy rings\" are horizontal ringshaped structures. Their center is the exit point of gas bubbles which escape from the substrate into the shallow water. The bubbles generate concentric waves which cause displacement of fine muddy sediments at the sediment-water interface Such gradual displacement guides mat-constructing microbes to grow concentrically. The \"fairy rings\" are crowned by pinnacle structures of bacterial and diatom origin. Pinnacles, \"fairy rings\" and pillow-like coatings of crack margins are biogenic structures which have to be genetically separated from purely physically controlled structures. © 1993 Institut für Paläontologie, Universität Erlangen."

        "Abstract": "Most larger water bodies worldwide are used for navigation, and the intensity of commercial and recreational navigation is expected to further increase. Navigation profoundly affects aquatic ecosystems. To facilitate navigation, rivers are trained and developed, and the direct effects of navigation include chemical and biological impacts (e.g., inputs of toxic substances and dispersal of non-native species, respectively). Furthermore, propagating ships create hydrodynamic alterations, often simply summarized as waves. Although ship-induced waves are recognized as influential stressors, knowledge on their effects is poorly synthesized. We present here a review on the effects of ship-induced waves on the structure, function and services of aquatic ecosystems based on more than 200 peer reviewed publications and technical reports. Ship-induced waves act at multiple organizational levels and different spatial and temporal scales. All the abiotic and biotic components of aquatic ecosystems are affected, from the sediment and nutrient budget to the planktonic, benthic and fish communities. We highlight how the effects of ship-induced waves cascade through ecosystems and how different effects interact and feed back into the ecosystem finally leading to altered ecosystem services and human health effects. Based on this synthesis of wave effects, we discuss strategies for mitigation. This may help to develop scientifically based and target-oriented management plans for navigational waters that optimize abiotic and biotic integrity and their ecosystem services and uses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

        "Abstract": "Nearly three-quarters of global natural rubber production is used to produce tyres, supporting mobility around the globe. The projected increase in mobility could contribute to further expansion of rubber plantations and impact tropical ecosystems. We quantified the use of natural rubber in tyres in the European Union (EU), the corresponding land footprint, and explored drivers of tyre use using country-specific transport statistics and trade registers of rubber goods. Five percent of the world’s natural rubber is consumed in tyres used in the EU, using up to a quarter of the area under rubber plantations in some producing countries. Car use is responsible for 58% of this consumption, due to car-dependent lifestyles that are associated with economic prosperity and spatial planning paradigms. While the EU’s transport policy focuses on reducing dependence on fossil-fuels, cross-cutting policies are needed to address car-dependency and reduce the EU’s land footprint in tropical landscapes without compromising progress towards decarbonisation. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Due to their high activation energy potential and good processability in wire shape, they are well suited for application in actively deformable, fibre-reinforced composite structures. In order to generate large deflections from the limited deformation potential of SMA, detailed analysis of the deformation mechanisms is required. In this work, a bionic approach is pursued, investigating the characteristics of locomotion systems of insects. A simplified joint concept is derived from the cockroach knee and implemented using flat knitting technology. A composite joint is manufactured with a resin infusion process and experimentally verified in regards to its motion behaviour. The presented results show good deformation behaviour with large deformation angles up to 60°, suggesting large potential for further development of the presented approach. © The Author(s) 2020."

        "Abstract": "The practical limitations inherent to human and robotic planetary exploration necessitate the development of specific protocols and methods. This non-standard approach requires testing and validation phases in order to optimise instrumental setups and improve data interpretation; this can occur prior to, during, or even after a mission. Flight instruments, and/or their spare models, may be evaluated using relevant terrestrial materials and/or locations. These materials are called analogues: “analogue sites” for large-scale locations, and “analogue samples” for smaller-scale materials. Depending on the scientific domain, the word “analogue” may carry different meanings but is invariably used to denote objects having compositions and/or physical properties similar to specific extraterrestrial objects. However, due to the variability in composition and properties of natural materials, there are always – inevitably – some differences between the analogue and the object(s) to which it refers. In analogue studies, it is, thus, important to focus on the specific properties that need to be imitated and to consider analogue properties rather than analogue sites or samples alone. Here, we introduce the concept of “functional analogues”. We first make an overview of the different types of analogues and sort them according to their utility. We then describe how different types of functional analogues can be used throughout the timeline of space missions, from the evaluation of different methods in the definition of a mission to understanding the results acquired by probes exploring extraterrestrial bodies. Finally, logical pathways are outlined that facilitate the selection of the best-suited functional analogue(s) according to their intended use and taking into account practical limitations. © 2021 The Authors"

        "Abstract": "Background: Elasticity prevents fatigue of tissues that are extensively and repeatedly deformed. Resilin is a resilient and elastic extracellular protein matrix in joints and hinges of insects. For its mechanical properties, Resilin is extensively analysed and applied in biomaterial and biomedical sciences. However, there is only indirect evidence for Resilin distribution and function in an insect. Commonly, the presence of dityrosines that covalently link Resilin protein monomers (Pro-Resilin), which are responsible for its mechanical properties and fluoresce upon UV excitation, has been considered to reflect Resilin incidence. Results: Using a GFP-tagged Resilin version, we directly identify Resilin in pliable regions of the Drosophila body, some of which were not described before. Interestingly, the amounts of dityrosines are not proportional to the amounts of Resilin in different areas of the fly body, arguing that the mechanical properties of Resilin matrices vary according to their need. For a functional analysis of Resilin matrices, applying the RNA interference and Crispr/Cas9 techniques, we generated flies with reduced or eliminated Resilin function, respectively. We find that these flies are flightless but capable of locomotion and viable suggesting that other proteins may partially compensate for Resilin function. Indeed, localizations of the potentially elastic protein Cpr56F and Resilin occasionally coincide. Conclusions: Thus, Resilin-matrices are composite in the way that varying amounts of different elastic proteins and dityrosinylation define material properties. Understanding the biology of Resilin will have an impact on Resilin-based biomaterial and biomedical sciences. © 2020, The Author(s)."

  "response": " Based on the context provided, there is no direct connection with the query regarding designing a coating for buildings that can dynamically change its optical properties to regulate heat absorption and reflection based on seasonal variations. However, the hydraulic principle mentioned in one of the contexts could potentially inspire a solution. The hydraulic principle describes organisms as systems composed of fluid contained within flexible membranes. This concept could be adapted for building materials by using hydrogel coatings that can expand or contract based on environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, to regulate heat absorption and reflection. Additionally, the use of biomimetic approaches, inspired by natural organisms like cephalopods and their ability to change skin color for camouflage, could be explored for creating coatings with dynamic optical properties. The context on Cathodoluminescence and Optical properties of self-assembled dipole chains in zeolites might also provide some inspiration for developing advanced coating materials. However, further research would be required to develop a practical solution.",

        "Abstract": "Artificial light at night (ALAN) is one of the most obvious hallmarks of human presence in an ecosystem. The rapidly increasing use of artificial light has fundamentally transformed nightscapes throughout most of the globe, although little is known about how ALAN impacts the biodiversity and food webs of illuminated ecosystems. We developed a large-scale experimental infrastructure to study the effects of ALAN on a light-naïve, natural riparian (i.e., terrestrial-aquatic) ecosystem. Twelve street lights (20 m apart) arranged in three rows parallel to an agricultural drainage ditch were installed on each of two sites located in a grassland ecosystem in northern Germany. A range of biotic, abiotic, and photometric data are collected regularly to study the short- and long-term effects of ALAN on behavior, species interactions, physiology, and species composition of communities. Here we describe the infrastructure setup and data collection methods, and characterize the study area including photometric measurements. None of the measured parameters differed significantly between sites in the period before illumination. Results of one short-term experiment, carried out with one site illuminated and the other acting as a control, demonstrate the attraction of ALAN by the immense and immediate increase of insect catches at the lit street lights. The experimental setup provides a unique platform for carrying out interdisciplinary research on sustainable lighting. © 2015 by the authors."

        "Abstract": "A systematic study of a large set of moldavites and the application of cathodoluminescence (CL)-spectroscopy with a detailed discussion of spectral features is presented. Optical CL microscopy and spectroscopy (OM-CL) were performed on 57 moldavite samples from different substrewn-fields in Germany and the Czech Republic. The extracted CL data were supported by SEM-EDX analysis. In general, two different kinds of CL colors can be distinguished: different shades of green in the matrix of the tektite glasses and a variation of blue color for lechatelierite inclusions (a pure silica-glass phase). Spectral analysis of these colors shows three CL emission bands for green and five bands for blue c. Most CL activators are structural defects of the local glass network, influenced by the crystal field. The visible green CL emission is caused by defects related to strong local disorder as well as Al-O−-Al defects. The blue CL emission is activated by different types of lattice defects such as nonbridging oxygen-hole center (NBOHC), self-trapped excitons (STE), and oxygen deficiency centers (ODC). Intensity variations of the CL emissions were observed for samples from the different localities, but there is no direct correlation between substrewn-fields and CL characteristics. Nevertheless, CL microscopy is a powerful tool for the high-contrast visualization of internal textures such as streaks and lechatelierite in the tektite matrix due to the luminescence properties of the defect structures in the glassy network. © The Meteoritical Society, 2017."

        "Abstract": "SYNOPSIS. AS theory rules method, the methodological procedures applied to morphological explanation have to be derived from the law-like properties of the objects under investigation. The explanation of organismic constructions has to be based on the hydraulic principle which describes organisms as systems composed of fluid contained within flexiblemembranes. This insight establishes a supra-molecular causal principle which, in its generality for morphological explanation, parallels the biochemical principles of molecular biology on the molecular level. Every form and architectural arrangement has to be conceived as the result of the form-enforcing influence of mechanical elements that operatewithin an integrated mechanically coherent system. An adequate explanation of morphological configuration has to elaborate the organization of the constructional whole and explain its properties as the result of a gradual transformation process that is constrained by internal mechanical principles. The theories developed by such a procedure are open to criticism and can be tested and corroborated by reference to experiments conducted by nature. © 1988 by the American Society of Zoologists."

        "Abstract": "In this paper we conduct geochemical and colourimetric measurements of glauconite grains in micromorphological thin sections from the Middle Stone Age site of Blombos Cave, South Africa, to investigate the formation, internal structure and reworking of heat-exposed cave deposits that are related to prehistoric burning events. Controlled heating experiments were first carried out on glauconite-rich loose sediments and block samples, both of which were collected from the Blombos Cave bedrock. The control samples were then subjected to Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), microscopic Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (micro-FTIR) and petrographic-colourimetric analyses. The control experiment shows that glauconitic minerals undergo a gradual and systematic colour change when temperatures reach higher than c. 300–400 °C, primarily due to dehydration and iron oxidation. They also undergo clear structural changes when temperatures reach higher than c. 550 °C due to dehydroxylation and mineral transformation. By assessing the nature and degree of heat-induced optical and molecular alteration in glauconitic minerals, we demonstrate how glauconite grains in thin sections can be classified by the temperature to which they were exposed (20–400 °C, >400 °C, >600 °C and >800 °C). To assess the archaeological relevance of our controlled heating experiment, we applied this glauconite classification scheme to >200 grains found in three micromorphological thin sections of a Middle Stone Age (MSA) combustion feature. These grains were individually geo-referenced within the local coordinate system of Blombos Cave, through a thin-section-based GIS mapping procedure. With improved spatial control, we were able to study both the general distribution of non-altered and heat-altered glauconite grains in their original sedimentary context, as well as to calculate heat distribution models that cover the entire sampled section. This combined geo-chemical, optical and spatio-contextual approach provides insights into more elusive aspects of MSA site structure and burning events, such as heat intensity, burning frequency, temperature distribution, internal hearth structure and post-depositional reworking. The workflow we propose may easily be implemented and adapted to other archaeological contexts and to analogous sedimentary materials that show comparable heat-induced alteration patterns. © 2017 The Authors"

Due to their high activation energy potential and good processability in wire shape, they are well suited for application in actively deformable, fibre-reinforced composite structures. In order to generate large deflections from the limited deformation potential of SMA, detailed analysis of the deformation mechanisms is required. In this work, a bionic approach is pursued, investigating the characteristics of locomotion systems of insects. A simplified joint concept is derived from the cockroach knee and implemented using flat knitting technology. A composite joint is manufactured with a resin infusion process and experimentally verified in regards to its motion behaviour.

        "Abstract": "Microscopic organisms that penetrate calcareous structures by actively dissolving the carbonate matrix, namely microendoliths, have an important influence on the breakdown of marine carbonates. The study of these microorganisms and the bioerosion traces they produce is crucial for understanding the impact of their bioeroding activity on the carbonate recycling in environments under global climate change. Traditionally, either the extracted microendoliths were studied by conventional microscopy or their traces were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of epoxy resin casts. A visualisation of the microendoliths in situ, that is within their complex microbioerosion structures, was previously limited to the laborious and time-consuming double-inclusion cast-embedding technique. Here, we assess the applicability of various fluorescence staining methods in combination with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) for the study of fungal microendoliths in situ in partly translucent mollusc shells. Among the tested methods, specific staining with dyes against the DNA (nuclei) of the trace making organisms turned out to be a useful and reproducible approach. Bright and clearly delineated fluorescence signals of microendolithic nuclei allow, for instance, a differentiation between abandoned and still populated microborings. Furthermore, infiltrating the microborings with fluorescently stained resin seems to be of great capability for the visualisation and quantification of microbioerosion structures in their original spatial orientation. Potential fields of application are rapid assessments of endolithic bio- and ichnodiversity and the quantification of the impact of microendoliths on the overall calcium carbonate turnover. The method can be applied after CLSM of the stained microendoliths and retains the opportunity for a subsequent investigation of epoxy casts with SEM. This allows a three-fold approach in studying microendoliths in the context of their microborings, thereby fostering the integration of biological and ichnological aspects of microbial bioerosion. © 2021 The Authors.

Plants are considered environmental markers and usually show structural adaptations that are characteristic of their habitat. Therefore, after passing through the charring process, they may not be completely consumed by the fire, being possible to find remnants of charcoal and other remaining materials. Based on this, the presence of charcoal is an evidence of the occurrence of current or past fires, contributing with a valuable source of (paleo) environmental proxy data. In this sense, the objective of this work is to assess the physical and chemical changes that occur on scraps of logs from Araucaria columnaris. It will be done during the charring process in muffle, at different temperatures, allowing us to assess important influences in relation to its forming process. The charring temperatures of the logs in natura were in a range of 50 to 1000 ° C, with ranging temperatures from 50 to 50 ° C, and heating ramp of 25 ° C min-1. The analysis of this result seeks to allow the proposal of a methodology that assists in the characterization of the natural processes involved in the forming of this type of material, serving as a contribution to (paleo) environmental inferences. © 2018.

        "Abstract": "The rapidly growing global road networks put serious pressures on terrestrial ecosystems and increase the number and severity of human-wildlife conflicts, which in most cases manifest in animal-vehicle collisions (AVCs). AVCs pose serious problems both for biodiversity conservation and traffic safety: each year, millions of vertebrates are roadkilled globally and the related economic damage is also substantial. For a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing AVC it is essential to explore the human factor, that is, the habits and attitude of drivers; however, to date, comprehensive surveys are lacking on this topic. Here we addressed this knowledge gap and surveyed the habits of drivers and their experience and attitude towards AVCs by a comprehensive questionnaire covering a large geographical area and involving a large number of respondents (1942 completed questionnaires). We aimed to reveal how driving habits affect the chance of AVC, and explored the attitude of the drivers regarding AVC. We found that the number of lifetime AVC cases was higher for male drivers, for those who drove longer distances per year, had more driven years, used country roads or drove large vehicles. Our results showed that almost half of the drivers surveyed had experienced at least one AVC in their lifetime. Drivers’ attitudes towards the importance of nature conservation or traffic safety in the aspect of AVC, and fear of collision showed a significant correlation with experienced AVC cases. Drivers' opinions indicated that the most trusted and desired AVC prevention measures were physical objects such as fences and wildlife crossings. Our research provides guidelines for developing targeted initiatives in the future to increase awareness about the significance of AVC and target those drivers who are most vulnerable to AVC. © 2023 The Authors"

        "Abstract": "The global increase of plastic production, linked with an overall plastic misuse and waste mismanagement, leads to an inevitable increase of plastic debris that ends up in our oceans. One of the major sinks of this pollution is the deep-sea floor, which is hypothesized to accumulate in its deepest points, the hadal trenches. Little is known about the magnitude of pollution in these trenches, given the remoteness of these environments, numerous factors influencing the input and sinking behavior of plastic debris from shallower environments. This study represents to the best of our knowledge the largest survey of (macro)plastic debris sampled at hadal depths, down to 9600 m. Industrial packaging and material assignable to fishing activities were the most common debris items in the Kuril Kamchatka trench, most likely deriving from long-distance transport by the Kuroshio extension current (KE) or from regional marine traffic and fishing activities. The chemical analysis by (Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy revealed that the main polymers detected were polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and nylon. Plastic waste is reaching the depths of the trench, although some of the items were only partially broken down. This finding suggests that complete breakdown into secondary microplastics (MP) may not always occur at the sea surface or though the water column. Due to increased brittleness, plastic debris may break apart upon reaching the hadal trench floor where plastic degrading factors were thought to be, coming off. The KKT's remote location and high sedimentation rates make it a potential site for high levels of plastic pollution, potentially making it one of the world's most heavily contaminated marine areas and an oceanic plastic deposition zone. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

        "Abstract": "The occurrence of microplastics throughout marine environments worldwide, from pelagic to benthic habitats, has become serious cause for concern. Hadal zones were recently described as the “trash bins of the oceans” and ultimate sink for marine plastic debris. The Kuril region covers a substantial area of the North Pacific Ocean and is characterised by high biological productivity, intense marine traffic through the Kuril straits, and anthropogenic activity. Moreover, strong tidal currents and eddy activity, as well as the influence of Pacific currents, have the potential for long distance transport and retention of microplastics in this area. To verify the hypothesis that the underlying Kuril Kamchatka Trench might accumulate microplastics from the surrounding environments and act as the final sink for high quantities of microplastics, we analysed eight sediment samples collected in the Kuril Kamchatka Trench at a depth range of 5143–8250 m during the Kuril Kamchatka Biodiversity Studies II (KuramBio II) expedition in summer 2016. Microplastics were characterised via Micro Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy. All samples were analysed in their entirety to avoid inaccuracies due to extrapolations of microplastic concentrations and polymer diversities, which would otherwise be based on commonly applied representative aliquots. The number of microplastic particles detected ranged from 14 to 209 kg−1 sediment (dry weight) with a total of 15 different plastic polymers detected. Polypropylene accounted for the largest proportion (33.2%), followed by acrylates/polyurethane/varnish (19%) and oxidized polypropylene (17.4%). By comparing extrapolated sample aliquots with in toto results, it was shown that aliquot-based extrapolations lead to severe under- or overestimations of microplastic concentrations, and an underestimation of polymer diversity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd; Microplastics were detected in the abyssal and hadal zones of the Kuril Kamchatka trench.By comparing extrapolated sample aliquots with in toto results, it was shown that aliquot-based extrapolations lead to severe under- or overestimations of microplastic concentrations and an underestimation of polymer diversity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

Microplastics were ubiquitous in the smaller fractions of the box corer samples from every station from depths between 4869 and 5766m. They were found on the abyssal plain and in the sediments of the trench slope on both sides. The amount of microplastics differed between the stations, with lowest concentration of 60piecesperm2 and highest concentrations of more than 2000piecesperm2. Around 75% of the microplastics (defined here as particles <1mm) we isolated from the sediment samples were fibers. Other particles were paint chips or small cracked pieces of unknown origin. The Kuril-Kamchatka Trench area is known for its very rich marine fauna (Zenkevich, 1963). Yet we can only guess how these microplastics accumulated in the deep sea of the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench area and what consequences the microplastic itself and its adsorbed chemicals will have on this very special and rich deep-sea fauna. But we herewith present an evaluation of the different kinds of plastic debris we found, as a documentation of human impact into the deep sea of this region of the Northwest Pacific. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

Given the increasing plastic production worldwide and the durability of these polymers, concerns arise about the fate of this material in the environment. A candidate to consider as a depositional final sink of MP is the sea floor and its deepest representatives, hadal trenches, as ultimate sinks. In this study, 13 sediment samples were collected with a multiple-corer at depths between 5740 and 9450 m from the Kuril Kamchatka trench (KKT), in the Northwest (NW) Pacific Ocean. These samples were analysed for MP presence in the upper sediment layer, by slicing the first 5 cm of sediment cores into 1 cm horizontal layers. These were compared against each other and between the sampling areas, in order to achieve a detailed picture of the depositional system of the trench and small-scale perturbations such as bioturbation. The analyses revealed the presence of 215 to 1596 MP particles per kg −1 sediment (dry weight), with a polymer composition represented by 14 polymer types and the prevalence of particles smaller than 25 μm. A heterogeneous microplastic distribution through the sediment column and different microplastic concentration and polymer types among sampling stations located in different areas of the trench reflects the dynamics of this environment and the numerous forces that drive the deposition processes and the in situ recast of this pollutant at the trench floor. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

The results showed that all sampled crabs had MPs in their gut in an average of 11.0 ± 1.85 items g−1, while the total MPs content in water ranges from 370 to 750 MPs per L−1. No significant difference in the content of MPs between the two crab species was found and a positive Pearson correlation, between microplastic abundance in the water and in the crabs regardless of species, was confirmed. The composition of microplastics showed consistency in crabs, sediment, and water, with fibers and pellets as the dominant types followed by microbeads, and fragments. Characterized MPs varied in size from <0.1 mm to 0.1–0.5 mm, showing variable colors of black, blue, and red domination. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis of the chemical composition of microplastics distinguished presence of the high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), and low-density polyethylene (LDPE), which showed consistency in water, sediment, and crab samples. In conclusion, high levels of MPs pollution observed in the Kune-Vain complex represent a serious threat to the lagoon ecosystem and to the local inhabitants. Furthermore, studies on MPs' impact on biota and local population health are urgently required. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

One possible approach is to draw inspiration from the biomechanics of animals, such as the cockroach knee discussed in the context. Shape memory alloys (SMA) mentioned in the text have been used to create semi-flexible joints with large deflections, which could be incorporated into shoe design for improved shock absorption and energy return. Another potential direction is to investigate how muscle attachment site morphology is affected by chronic exercise, as described in one of the texts, and design shoes that optimize these attachments for enhanced running performance. Additionally, examining the functional and allometric implications of hipbone trabecular microarchitecture in various mammals could provide insights into effective weight distribution and shock absorption properties for shoe design. However, it is important to note that any potential solutions should be evaluated for their scientific feasibility and practical applicability.",

Due to their high activation energy potential and good processability in wire shape, they are well suited for application in actively deformable, fibre-reinforced composite structures. In order to generate large deflections from the limited deformation potential of SMA, detailed analysis of the deformation mechanisms is required. In this work, a bionic approach is pursued, investigating the characteristics of locomotion systems of insects. A simplified joint concept is derived from the cockroach knee and implemented using flat knitting technology. A composite joint is manufactured with a resin infusion process and experimentally verified in regards to its motion behaviour. The presented results show good deformation behaviour with large deformation angles up to 60°, suggesting large potential for further development of the presented approach. © The Author(s) 2020."

        "Abstract": "Skeletal muscles attach to bone at their origins and insertions, and the interface where tendon meets bone is termed the attachment site or enthesis. Mechanical stresses at the muscle/tendon-bone interface are proportional to the surface area of the bony attachment sites, such that a larger attachment site will distribute loads over a wider area. Muscles that are frequently active and/or are of larger size should cause attachment sites to hypertrophy (training effect); however, experimental studies of animals subjected to exercise have provided mixed results. To enhance our ability to detect training effects (a type of phenotypic plasticity), we studied a mouse model in which 4 replicate lines of High Runner (HR) mice have been selectively bred for 57 generations. Selection is based on the average number of wheel revolutions on days 5 & 6 of a 6-day period of wheel access as young adults (6–8 weeks old). Four additional lines are bred without regard to running and serve as non-selected controls (C). On average, mice from HR lines voluntarily run ~3 times more than C mice on a daily basis. For this study, we housed 50 females (half HR, half C) with wheels (Active group) and 50 (half HR, half C) without wheels (Sedentary group) for 12 weeks starting at weaning (~3 weeks old). We tested for evolved differences in muscle attachment site surface area between HR and C mice, plastic changes resulting from chronic exercise, and their interaction. We used a precise, highly repeatable method for quantifying the three-dimensional (3D) surface area of four muscle attachment sites: the humerus deltoid tuberosity (the insertion point for the spinodeltoideus, superficial pectoralis, and acromiodeltoideus), the femoral third trochanter (the insertion point for the quadratus femoris), the femoral lesser trochanter (the insertion point for the iliacus muscle), and the femoral greater trochanter (insertion point for the middle gluteal muscles). In univariate analyses, with body mass as a covariate, mice in the Active group had significantly larger humerus deltoid tuberosities than Sedentary mice, with no significant difference between HR and C mice and no interaction between exercise treatment and linetype. These differences between Active and Sedentary mice were also apparent in the multivariate analyses. Surface areas of the femoral third trochanter, femoral lesser trochanter, and femoral greater trochanter were unaffected by either chronic wheel access or selective breeding. Our results, which used robust measurement protocols and relatively large sample sizes, demonstrate that muscle attachment site morphology can be (but is not always) affected by chronic exercise experienced during ontogeny. However, contrary to previous results for other aspects of long bone morphology, we did not find evidence for evolutionary coadaptation of muscle attachments with voluntary exercise behavior in the HR mice. © 2021 Anatomical Society"

        "Abstract": "The morphology of entheses (muscle/tendon attachment sites) on bones is routinely used in paleontological and bioarcheological studies to infer the physical activity patterns of ancient vertebrate species including hominins. However, such inferences have often been disputed owing to limitations of the quantitative methods commonly employed and a lack of experimental evidence demonstrating direct effects of physical activity on entheseal morphology. Recently, we introduced a new and improved method of quantifying and analyzing entheseal morphology that involves repeatable three-dimensional measurements combined with multivariate statistics focused on associations among multiple entheses. Here, to assess the validity of our method for investigating variation in entheseal morphology related to physical activity patterns, we analyzed femora of growing turkeys that were experimentally exercised for 10 weeks on either an inclined or declined treadmill or served as controls (N=15 individuals, 5 per group). Our multivariate approach identified certain patterns involving three different entheses (associated with the gluteus primus, medial gastrocnemius, vastus medialis and adductor magnus muscles) that clearly differentiated controls from runners. Importantly, these differences were not observable when comparing groups within each of the three entheseal structures separately. Body mass was not correlated with the resulting multivariate patterns. These results provide the first experimental evidence that variation in physical activity patterns has a direct influence on entheseal morphology. Moreover, our findings highlight the promise of our newly developed quantitative methods for analyzing the morphology of entheses to reconstruct the behavior of extinct vertebrate species based on their skeletal remains. © 2019.

        "Abstract": "The pelvis plays an active role in weight bearing and countering the ground reaction forces incurred by the hindlimbs thus making it a critical component of the locomotor skeleton. Accordingly, this anatomical region is theoretically ideal for inferring locomotor behavior from both external skeletal morphology and trabecular microarchitecture, with the latter possibly offering nuanced insights into the mechanical loading environment given its increased plasticity and higher turnover rate. However, trabecular microarchitecture is also known to be influenced by a variety of factors including body size, sex, age, genetic regulation, diet and activity level, that collectively hinder the ability to generate consistent functional inferences. In this study, a comparative sample of mammals (42 species spanning four orders) of varying sizes, yet comparable locomotor repertoires, were evaluated to determine the effects of body size, phylogeny and locomotion on hipbone trabecular microarchitecture. This study found a weak functional signal detected in differences in bone volume fraction and the degree of anisotropy across certain pre-assigned locomotor categories, while confirming previously recognized allometric scaling trends reported for other mammalian samples based on the femur. Within primates, a more anisotropic pattern was observed for quadrupedal species attributed to their repetitive loading regimes and stereotypical limb excursions, while isotropic values were revealed for taxa utilizing more varied arboreal repertoires. Humans, despite a frequent and predictable loading environment associated with their use of bipedalism, showed relatively isotropic values. This study highlights the confounding factors that influence trabecular microarchitecture and consequently limit its utility as a method for investigating locomotor adaptation. © 2021, The Author(s)."

        "Abstract": "The extent to which different kinds of organisms have adapted to environmental temperature regimes is central to understanding how they respond to climate change. The Scholander-Irving (S-I) model of heat transfer lays the foundation for explaining how endothermic birds and mammals maintain their high, relatively constant body temperatures in the face of wide variation in environmental temperature. The S-I model shows how body temperature is regulated by balancing the rates of heat production and heat loss. Both rates scale with body size, suggesting that larger animals should be better adapted to cold environments than smaller animals, and vice versa. However, the global distributions of ∼ 9,000 species of terrestrial birds and mammals show that the entire range of body sizes occurs in nearly all climatic regimes. Using physiological and environmental temperature data for 211 bird and 178 mammal species, we test for mass-independent adaptive changes in two key parameters of the S-I model: basal metabolic rate (BMR) and thermal conductance. We derive an axis of thermal adaptation that is independent of body size, extends the S-I model, and highlights interactions among physiological and morphological traits that allow endotherms to persist in a wide range of temperatures. Our macrophysiological and macroecological analyses support our predictions that shifts in BMR and thermal conductance confer important adaptations to environmental temperature in both birds and mammals."

        "Abstract": "The relationships among species' physiological capacities and the geographical variation of ambient climate are of key importance to understanding the distribution of life on the Earth. Furthermore, predictions of how species will respond to climate change will profit from the explicit consideration of their physiological tolerances. The climatic variability hypothesis, which predicts that climatic tolerances are broader in more variable climates, provides an analytical framework for studying these relationships between physiology and biogeography. However, direct empirical support for the hypothesis is mostly lacking for endotherms, and few studies have tried to integrate physiological data into assessments of species' climatic vulnerability at the global scale. Here, we test the climatic variability hypothesis for endotherms, with a comprehensive dataset on thermal tolerances derived from physiological experiments, and use these data to assess the vulnerability of species to projected climate change. We find the expected relationship between thermal tolerance and ambient climatic variability in birds, but not in mammals-a contrast possibly resulting from different adaptation strategies to ambient climate via behaviour, morphology or physiology. We show that currently most of the species are experiencing ambient temperatures well within their tolerance limits and that in the future many species may be able to tolerate projected temperature increases across significant proportions of their distributions. However, our findings also underline the high vulnerability of tropical regions to changes in temperature and other threats of anthropogenic global changes. Our study demonstrates that a better understanding of the interplay among species' physiology and the geography of climate change will advance assessments of species' vulnerability to climate change. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

        "Abstract": "With the world continuously warming, a mechanistic understanding of how temperature affects interaction strengths, which are fundamental to food-web stability, is needed. As interaction strengths are determined by the flows of energy from resources to consumers, we investigated effects of temperature on animal energetics. We used newly compiled datasets on respiration rates and assimilation efficiencies to assess how temperature affects the energy use (respiration rates) and the efficiency of energy gain (assimilation efficiency) for different consumer types. Furthermore, we incorporated our findings in a simulation of temperature effects on maintenance feeding rates (i.e. energy consumption necessary to sustain life). Our analysis revealed a generally positive temperature dependence of assimilation efficiencies across consumer types thus implying a net energy gain with warming. The temperature scaling of respiration rates did not differ between consumer types. Based on these parameters we calculated maintenance feeding rates and compared them to empirically measured (realized) feeding rates. This comparison revealed that detritivores and herbivores have the potential to increase their biomasses under warming as their maintenance feeding rates increase less strongly than their realized feeding rates. For carnivores, however, we found a stronger increase of their maintenance feeding rates compared to their realized feeding rates, which should lead to decreased population sizes under warming. Overall, our results increase the understanding of climate change effects on ecosystems as they suggest profound energetic consequences for natural communities. © 2017 The Authors"

        "Abstract": "Aim: Physiological traits that approximate the fundamental climatic niche - the climatic conditions where a species can survive - are the outcome of adaptation to the environment under historical and current environmental constraints. If a large amount of the variation in physiological traits among species can be explained by their phylogeny rather than by contemporary environmental conditions, this would indicate phylogenetic conservatism in physiological traits, i.e. the tendency of species to retain their ancestral physiology over time. Here, we evaluate the relative contributions of phylogeny and environment to explain the variation in physiological traits of birds and mammals at the global level, as well as separately for tropical versus temperate species. Location: Global. Methods: We compiled a large data set from the literature, on the thermal traits and basal metabolic rates of 552 endotherms (255 bird and 297 mammal species) as measured in physiological experiments, along with phylogenetic, geographical and climatic data. Our analyses, which were performed separately for birds and mammals, partitioned the variation in comparative physiological data into the relative contributions of phylogenetic and environmental distance matrices. Results: Overall, the current environment explained a larger amount of variation in thermal traits among species than the phylogeny. However, we found that phylogeny was much more important than current environment for explaining the variation in physiological traits in the tropics, whereas environment was more important than phylogeny in temperate species. Main conclusions: While evidence for phylogenetic conservatism in physiological traits at the global level was weak, results for tropical species suggest phylogenetic conservatism in their physiological traits. These results indicate a stronger tendency in tropical species to retain their ancestral thermal traits, which might in turn imply a lower physiological adaptability of tropical species to ongoing and future climate change. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

        "Abstract": "Organisms have the capacity to alter their physiological response to warming through acclimation or adaptation, but the consequence of this metabolic plasticity for energy flow through food webs is currently unknown, and a generalisable framework does not exist for modelling its ecosystem-level effects. Here, using temperature-controlled experiments on stream invertebrates from a natural thermal gradient, we show that the ability of organisms to raise their metabolic rate following chronic exposure to warming decreases with increasing body size. Chronic exposure to higher temperatures also increases the acute thermal sensitivity of whole-organismal metabolic rate, independent of body size. A mathematical model parameterised with these findings shows that metabolic plasticity could account for 60% higher ecosystem energy flux with just +2 °C of warming than a traditional model based on ecological metabolic theory. This could explain why long-term warming amplifies ecosystem respiration rates through time in recent mesocosm experiments, and highlights the need to embed metabolic plasticity in predictive models of global warming impacts on ecosystems. © 2022, The Author(s)."

        "Abstract": "The tremendous diversity of life in the ocean has proven to be a rich source of inspiration for drug discovery, with success rates for marine natural products up to 4 times higher than other naturally derived compounds. Yet the marine biodiscovery pipeline is characterized by chronic underfunding, bottlenecks and, ultimately, untapped potential. For instance, a lack of taxonomic capacity means that, on average, 20 years pass between the discovery of new organisms and the formal publication of scientific names, a prerequisite to proceed with detecting and isolating promising bioactive metabolites. The need for \"edge\"research that can spur novel lines of discovery and lengthy high-risk drug discovery processes, are poorly matched with research grant cycles. Here we propose five concrete pathways to broaden the biodiscovery pipeline and open the social and economic potential of the ocean genome for global benefit: (1) investing in fundamental research, even when the links to industry are not immediately apparent; (2) cultivating equitable collaborations between academia and industry that share both risks and benefits for these foundational research stages; (3) providing new opportunities for early-career researchers and under-represented groups to engage in high-risk research without risking their careers; (4) sharing data with global networks; and (5) protecting genetic diversity at its source through strong conservation efforts. The treasures of the ocean have provided fundamental breakthroughs in human health and still remain under-utilised for human benefit, yet that potential may be lost if we allow the biodiscovery pipeline to become blocked in a search for quick-fix solutions.

        "Abstract": "Photorhabdus spp. (Enterobacteriales: Morganellaceae) occur exclusively as symbionts of Heterorhabditis nematodes for which they provide numerous services, including killing insects and providing nutrition and defence within the cadavers. Unusually, two species (Photorhabdus cinerea and Photorhabdus temperata) associate with a single population of Heterorhabditis downesi at a dune grassland site. Building on previous work, we investigated competition between these two Photorhabdus species both at the regional (between insects) and local (within insect) level by trait comparison and co-culture experiments. There was no difference between the species with respect to supporting nematode reproduction and protection of cadavers against invertebrate scavengers, but P. cinerea was superior to P. temperata in several traits: faster growth rate, greater antibacterial and antifungal activity and colonisation of a higher proportion of nematodes in co-culture. Moreover, where both bacterial symbionts colonised single nematode infective juveniles, P. cinerea tended to dominate in numbers. Differences between Photorhabdus species were detected in the suite of secondary metabolites produced: P. temperata produced several compounds not produced by P. cinerea including anthraquinone pigments. Bioluminescence emitted by P. temperata also tended to be brighter than that from P. cinerea. Bioluminescence and pigmentation may protect cadavers against scavengers that rely on sight. We conclude that while P. cinerea may show greater local level (within-cadaver) competitive success, co-existence of the two Photorhabdus species in the spatially heterogeneous environment of the dunes is favoured by differing specialisations in defence of the cadaver against differing locally important threats. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

In the context of route planning for delivery trucks, we could consider using a simple heuristic such as the nearest neighbor or greedy algorithm. These heuristics work by selecting the closest available location to visit next, reducing overall travel time and fuel consumption. While this may not be the most optimal solution in all cases, it is a simple and effective approach that can make decisions fast and avoid overfitting.

        "Abstract": "The Centre for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (ABC) has hypothesized that much human decision making can be described by simple algorithmic process models (heuristics). This chapter explains this approach and relates it to research in biology on rules of thumb, which we also review. As an example of a simple heuristic, consider the lexicographic strategy of take-the-best for choosing between two alternatives: Cues are searched in turn until one discriminates, then search stops and all other cues are ignored. Heuristics consist of building blocks, and building blocks exploit evolved or learned abilities such as recognition memory; it is the complexity of these abilities that allows the heuristics to be simple. Simple heuristics have an advantage in making decisions fast and with little information, and in avoiding overfitting. Furthermore, humans are observed to use simple heuristics. Simulations show that the statistical structures of different environments affect which heuristics perform better, a relationship referred to as ecological rationality. We contrast ecological rationality with the stronger claim of adaptation. Rules of thumb from biology provide clearer examples of adaptation because animals can be studied in the environments in which they evolved. The range of examples is also much more diverse. To investigate them, biologists have sometimes used similar simulation techniques to ABC, but many examples depend on empirically driven approaches. ABC's theoretical framework can be useful in connecting some of these examples, particularly the scattered literature on how information from different cues is integrated. Optimality modeling is usually used to explain less detailed aspects of behavior but might more often be redirected to investigate rules of thumb. © 2011 Oxford University Press.

        "Abstract": "Conservation areas, like national parks, are hotspots of social-ecological and social-economic activities. The resulting interactions contribute to an inherent complexity of these systems, making simulation models a vital form of support for their management activities. These models are often unimodal, i.e., limited by design to only one particular question or a specific temporal and spatial scale. We implemented the cross-scale and multi-modal base model MARS KNP for the Kruger National Park, South Africa that combines the agent-based paradigm with a dynamic vegetation model. As a proof-of-concept, we developed an elephant movement model within MARS KNP to evaluate the base model's decision-support capabilities. The study was mainly focused on the underlying software mechanisms that allow easy integration of multi-scale spatio-temporal data objects. MARS agents can probe, interact with, and modify these objects. We found that this feature is essential for a cross-scale integration of different modeling approaches. Additionally, we propose a definition of the term ‘base model’ to shorten the provisioning time of decision-support tools. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

We characterize the social-ecological dynamics of giant honey bees with indigenous peoples of Tagbanua ethnicity using the mobile agent-based ecosystem service (MABES) framework. Chemical and pollen analysis conducted on honey samples generated data on the ecological features of this linked social-ecological system. These were supplemented by 251 household surveys and key informant interviews with institutional representatives to identify the social and institutional features of the system. Honey samples analyzed for pollen showed a total of 11 different plant families and did not have any traces of pesticide residue. The majority of households interviewed use honey as food, medicine, and a saleable commodity. A small percentage of households use fertilizers and pesticides known to be harmful to bees. Institutions have different knowledge strengths that can be tapped through a transdisciplinary approach. As the scale of production and delivery of MABES is distinctly a product of the mobility of service-delivering organisms, we recommend using a landscape approach with a focus on maintaining the quality of both the local environment and landscapes around the site of ES delivery. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

        "Abstract": "Predator–prey interactions are central to fitness as animals simultaneously avoid death and consume resources to ensure growth and reproduction. Along with direct effects, predators can also exert strong non-consumptive effects. For example, prey shift habitat use in the presence of predators, a potentially learned behavior. The impact of cognition on movement and predator interactions is largely unexplored despite evidence of learned responses to predation threat. We explore how learning and spatial memory influence predator–prey dynamics by introducing predators into a memory-driven movement modeling framework. To model various aspects of risk, we vary predator behavior: their persistence and spatial correlation with the prey’s resources. Memory outperforms simpler movement processes most in patchy environments with more predictable predators that are more easily avoided once learned. In these cases, memory aids foragers in managing the food–safety trade-off. For example, particular parameterizations of the predation memory reduce encounters while maintaining consumption. We found that non-consumptive effects are highest in landscapes of concentrated, patchy resources. These effects are intensified when predators are highly correlated with the forager’s resources. Smooth landscapes provide more opportunities for foragers to simultaneously consume resources and avoid predators. Predators are able to effectively guard all resources in very patchy landscapes. These non-consumptive effects are also seen with the shift away from the best quality habitat compared to foraging in a predator-free environment. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature."

Optimally inferring the mostly unobserved movement path and its dynamics from a limited sample of telemetry observations is a key unsolved problem, however. The field of geostatistics has focused significant attention on a mathematically analogous problem that has a statistically optimal solution coined after its inventor, Krige. Kriging revolutionized geostatistics and is now the gold standard for interpolating between a limited number of autocorrelated spatial point observations. Here we translate Kriging for use with animal movement data. Our Kriging formalism encompasses previous methods to estimate animal's trajectories - the Brownian bridge and continuous-time correlated random walk library - as special cases, informs users as to when these previous methods are appropriate, and provides a more general method when they are not. We demonstrate the capabilities of Kriging on a case study with Mongolian gazelles where, compared to the Brownian bridge, Kriging with a more optimal model was 10% more precise in interpolating locations and 500% more precise in estimating occurrence areas. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America."

Sustainable living in the Gulf area is dependent upon such resources provided by the sea. Large areas of its coastal zone including important marine habitats are currently threatened by increasing stress on the Gulf ecosystem due to an accelerated coastal development during the last few years. Some of the world's largest landfill and dredging projects are found in the coastal areas, and the world's main crude oil shipping routes pass through the open sea. A variety of human impacts are contributing to marine pollution, such as oil, sediments, waste, thermal, chemical, and other forms of pollution. This volume reviews present sources and levels of pollution in the Gulf, assesses their causes and effects on biota and ecosystems, and identifies gaps and obstacles currently preventing an effective integrated transboundary management of the marine and coastal resources. It highlights preventive and remedial measures reducing levels of pollution and mitigating adverse impacts.

Current regional issues include localized destruction of coral reefs, seagrass and mangroves; declines in some fisheries; exploitation of some endangered species; pollution from the development and transport of petroleum; and disposal of industrial and municipal wastes. The underlying causes of these issues are the natural vulnerability of the Red Sea due to its semi-enclosed nature; economic reliance on the petroleum industry; significant navigation risks; a rapidly increasing coastal population and associated developments; lack of fisheries information, surveillance and management; poor coastal zone planning; and limited technical expertise. Strategic actions addressing these issues will need to be implemented regionally and focus on coastal zone management that integrates environmental planning, environmental assessment and review; training and institutional development; public awareness and participation; information gathering especially fisheries statistics; reducing navigation risks; and the development of resource management and conservation strategies."

        "Abstract": "Ocean acidification is a threat to deep-sea corals and could lead to dramatic and rapid loss of the reef framework habitat they build. Weakening of structurally critical parts of the coral reef framework can lead to physical habitat collapse on an ecosystem scale, reducing the potential for biodiversity support. The mechanism underpinning crumbling and collapse of corals can be described via a combination of laboratory-scale experiments and mathematical and computational models. We synthesise data from electron back-scatter diffraction, micro-computed tomography, and micromechanical experiments, supplemented by molecular dynamics and continuum micromechanics simulations to predict failure of coral structures under increasing porosity and dissolution. Results reveal remarkable mechanical properties of the building material of cold-water coral skeletons of 462 MPa compressive strength and 45–67 GPa stiffness. This is 10 times stronger than concrete, twice as strong as ultrahigh performance fibre reinforced concrete, or nacre. Contrary to what would be expected, CWCs retain the strength of their skeletal building material despite a loss of its stiffness even when synthesised under future oceanic conditions. As this is on the material length-scale, it is independent of increasing porosity from exposure to corrosive water or bioerosion. Our models then illustrate how small increases in porosity lead to significantly increased risk of crumbling coral habitat. This new understanding, combined with projections of how seawater chemistry will change over the coming decades, will help support future conservation and management efforts of these vulnerable marine ecosystems by identifying which ecosystems are at risk and when they will be at risk, allowing assessment of the impact upon associated biodiversity. © 2022, The Author(s)."

        "Abstract": "Alpine landscapes are heavily influenced by ski run management, which can have severe impacts on alpine biodiversity. To assess these impacts on alpine Orthoptera, we compared species richness and species abundance in 41 plot pairs on ski runs and adjacent off-slope control plots in three ski resorts in Austria and Germany. A mixed modelling approach was used to assess the impacts of ski run preparation, artificial snow-making and environmental variables such as altitude, cover of dwarf shrubs and the application of fertilizer. Ski run plots showed a significantly lower species richness and number of individuals than control plots. Moreover, artificial snow led to a further decrease in species number. Hierarchical variance partitioning revealed that Orthoptera community composition is best predicted by environmental variables indirectly related to ski run management (fertilization, cover of dwarf shrubs) and to altitude. Only one out of five species significantly decreased in abundance after artificial snow-making. Other species were more sensitive to fertilizing and altitude. Dwarf shrubs were negatively associated with ski run management but positively associated with abundance of three species and species richness. Our data provide evidence for both direct and indirect consequences of ski runs and artificial snow-making on alpine Orthoptera. Overall, Orthoptera communities are suitable indicators for human-induced changes in alpine environments. In particular, a shift towards generalist species such as Chorthippus parallelus along with a decrease in typical alpine species gives cause for concern as this implies a homogenisation of biodiversity owing to ski run management. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

AS theory rules method, the methodological procedures applied to morphological explanation have to be derived from the law-like properties of the objects under investigation. The explanation of organismic constructions has to be based on the hydraulic principle which describes organisms as systems composed of fluid contained within flexiblemembranes. This insight establishes a supra-molecular causal principle which, in its generality for morphological explanation, parallels the biochemical principles of molecular biology on the molecular level. Every form and architectural arrangement has to be conceived as the result of the form-enforcing influence of mechanical elements that operatewithin an integrated mechanically coherent system. An adequate explanation of morphological configuration has to elaborate the organization of the constructional whole and explain its properties as the result of a gradual transformation process that is constrained by internal mechanical principles. The theories developed by such a procedure are open to criticism and can be tested and corroborated by reference to experiments conducted by nature. © 1988 by the American Society of Zoologists."

However, the spatiotemporal occurrence of systematic herding practices has been difficult to identify in the bioarchaeological record. To address this research gap, this study proposes a new virtual anthropological approach for reconstructing habitual physical activity in reindeer, relying on the protocols of the “Validated Entheses based Reconstruction of Activity” (VERA) method. Following blind analytical procedures, we focused on eight muscle attachment sites (“entheses”) in 36 reindeer free ranging in the wild, 21 specimens in captivity (zoo), and eight racing reindeer (habitual runners). Importantly, our analyses accounted for the effects of variation by subspecies, sex, age, and estimated body size. Our results showed clear differences across activity groups, leading to the development of discriminant function equations with cross-validated accuracies ranging from approximately 88 to 100%. The reliability of our functions was additionally confirmed using a blind test involving six zoo individuals not included in the initial dataset.

  "response": " Based on the provided context, there is no direct connection between the query and the context regarding developing a non-invasive method to monitor blood glucose levels in diabetic patients. However, I would like to suggest that you explore the use of ketone bodies as potential indicators of metabolic status in diabetes. The context includes information about the detection of acetoacetate (Acn), a ketone body, within tumor tissue and normal appearing white matter using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRSI). This finding suggests that Acn could be used as a marker for monitoring metabolic status in various tissues, including those related to diabetes. Further research is needed to validate the feasibility of non-invasively monitoring blood glucose levels using ketone bodies as markers, potentially through the development of advanced sensing technologies that can detect and quantify these molecules in bodily fluids or tissues.",

        "Abstract": "The development of genetic detection protocols for field applications is an important aspect of modern medical diagnostic technology and environmental monitoring. In this paper, we report a rapid, portable, and inexpensive DNA hybridization technique using a bead-based microfluidic platform that functions by passing fluorescently labeled target DNA through a chamber packed with functionalized beads within a microfluidic channel. DNA hybridization is then assessed using a digital camera attached to a Clare Chemical DR-45M dark reader non-UV transilluminator that uses visible light as an excitation source and a blue and amber filter to reveal fluorescence. This microfluidic approach significantly enhances hybridization by reducing the diffusion time between target DNA and the silica surface. The use of probe-functionalized beads as solid support also enhances the sensitivity and limit of detection due to a larger surface area per unit volume. This platform could be adapted for use in medical applications and environmental monitoring, including the detection of harmful organisms in the ballast water of ships. © 2009 American Institute of Physics."

A particular challenge is that several types of data are being measured to cope with the complexity of the underlying systems, enhance predictive modeling and enrich molecular understanding. Here we review a number of recent approaches that specialize in the analysis of multimodal data in the context of predictive biomedicine. We focus on methods that combine different OMIC measurements with image or genome variation data.

        "Abstract": "Although type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing β-cells, its treatment is largely restricted to exogenous insulin administration. Only few therapies targeting the autoaggressive immune system have been introduced into clinical practice or are considered in clinical trials. Here, we provide a gene expression profile of the islet microenvironment obtained by laser-dissection microscopy in an inducible mouse model. Thereby, we have identified novel targets for immune intervention. Increased gene expression of most inflammatory proteins was apparent at day 10 after T1D induction and largely paralleled the observed degree of insulitis. We further focused on genes involved in leukocyte migration, including chemokines and their receptors. Besides the critical chemokine CXCL10, we found several other chemokines upregulated locally in temporary or chronic manner. Localization of the chemokine ligand/receptor pairs to the islet microenvironment has been confirmed by RNAscope. Interference with the CXCL16-CXCR6 and CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axes, but not the CCL5-CCR1/3/5 axis, resulted in reduced insulitis and lower T1D incidence. Further, we found that the receptors for the differentially expressed chemokines CXCL10, CXCL16 and CX3CL1 are distributed unevenly among islet autoantigen-specific T cells, which explains why the interference with just one chemokine axis cannot completely abrogate insulitis and T1D. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

        "Abstract": "Background: The ERGO2 (Ernaehrungsumstellung bei Patienten mit Rezidiv eines Glioblastoms) MR-spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) subtrial investigated metabolism in patients randomized to calorically restricted ketogenic diet/intermittent fasting (crKD-IF) versus standard diet (SD) in addition to re-irradiation (RT) for recurrent malignant glioma. Intracerebral concentrations of ketone bodies (KB), intracellular pH (pHi), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were non-invasively determined. Methods: 50 patients were randomized (1:1): Group A keeping a crKD-IF for nine days, and Group B a SD. RT was performed on day 4–8. Twenty-three patients received an extended MRSI-protocol (1H decoupled31P MRSI with 3D chemical shift imaging (CSI) and 2D1H point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS)) at a 3T scanner at baseline and on day 6. Voxels were selected from the area of recurrent tumor and contralateral hemisphere. Spectra were analyzed with LCModel, adding simulated signals of 3-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB), acetone (Acn) and acetoacetate (AcAc) to the standard basis set. Results: Acn was the only reliably MRSI-detectable KB within tumor tissue and/or normal appearing white matter (NAWM). It was detected in 4/11 patients in Group A and in 0/8 patients in Group B. MRSI results showed no significant depletion of ATP in tumor tissue of patients at day 6 during crKD-IF, even though there were a significant difference in ketone serum levels between Group A and B at day 6 and a decline in fasting glucose in Group A from baseline to day 6. The tumor specific alkaline pHi was maintained. Conclusion: Our metabolic findings suggest that tumor cells maintain energy homeostasis even with reduced serum glucose levels and may generate additional ATP through other sources. © 2020 by the authors.

        "Abstract": "Protein biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer are critical for the early detection of the cancer to improve patient prognosis and for the clinical management of the disease to monitor treatment response and to detect recurrences. Unfortunately, the discovery of protein biomarkers is hampered by the limited availability of reliable and sensitive assays needed for the reproducible quantification of proteins in complex biological matrices such as blood plasma. In recent years, targeted mass spectrometry, exemplified by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) has emerged as a method, capable of overcoming this limitation. Here, we present a comprehensive SRM-based strategy for developing plasma-based protein biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer and illustrate how the SRM platform, when combined with rigorous experimental design and statistical analysis, can result in detection of predictive analytes. Our biomarker development strategy first involved a discovery-driven proteomic effort to derive potential N-glycoprotein biomarker candidates for plasma-based detection of human ovarian cancer from a genetically engineered mouse model of endometrioid ovarian cancer, which accurately recapitulates the human disease. Next, 65 candidate markers selected from proteins of different abundance in the discovery dataset were reproducibly quantified with SRM assays across a large cohort of over 200 plasma samples from ovarian cancer patients and healthy controls. Finally, these measurements were used to derive a 5-protein signature for distinguishing individuals with epithelial ovarian cancer from healthy controls. The sensitivity of the candidate biomarker signature in combination with CA125 ELISA-based measurements currently used in clinic, exceeded that of CA125 ELISA-based measurements alone. The SRM-based strategy in this study is broadly applicable. It can be used in any study that requires accurate and reproducible quantification of selected proteins in a high-throughput and multiplexed fashion. © 2019 Hüttenhain et al.

        "Abstract": "Aim: To understand how climatic conditions influence the geographical distributions of species and their potential responses to climate change, we investigated the relationships between the thermal tolerances of species and the size and limits of their distributions. We tested two hypotheses for endotherms: the climatic variability hypothesis, which predicts increases in range size with increasing breadth of thermal tolerance, and the climatic extreme hypothesis, which predicts that range limits are related to thermal tolerance limits. Furthermore, we tested whether these relationships differ between temperate and tropical areas. Location: Global. Time period: Present. Major taxa studied: Birds and mammals. Methods: We compiled data on thermal tolerances that had been measured in physiological experiments for 453 endothermic species, along with information on geographical ranges and climatic conditions. We applied phylogenetic generalized least square regressions to test for relationships between thermal tolerance and (a) range size or limits and (b) breadth and extremes of the climatic conditions that each species experiences across its distribution. Results: We found that range size was not related to the breadth thermal tolerance for endotherms. However, the range limits at high latitudes as well as the minimum temperatures experienced by species were closely related to the physiological cold tolerances of species. These relationships were particularly strong in temperate regions, but these patterns were not found in the tropics. Main conclusions: Our results are inconsistent with the predictions of the climatic variability hypothesis, but are in line with the predictions of the climatic extreme hypothesis. Furthermore, the factors determining species distributions do not appear to be the same in tropical and temperate regions. Our study emphasizes the need to combine spatially explicit distribution models with information from physiological experiments in order to capture regional differences and improve predictions of the responses of species to climate change. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

        "Abstract": "The extent to which different kinds of organisms have adapted to environmental temperature regimes is central to understanding how they respond to climate change. The Scholander-Irving (S-I) model of heat transfer lays the foundation for explaining how endothermic birds and mammals maintain their high, relatively constant body temperatures in the face of wide variation in environmental temperature. The S-I model shows how body temperature is regulated by balancing the rates of heat production and heat loss. Both rates scale with body size, suggesting that larger animals should be better adapted to cold environments than smaller animals, and vice versa. However, the global distributions of ∼ 9,000 species of terrestrial birds and mammals show that the entire range of body sizes occurs in nearly all climatic regimes. Using physiological and environmental temperature data for 211 bird and 178 mammal species, we test for mass-independent adaptive changes in two key parameters of the S-I model: basal metabolic rate (BMR) and thermal conductance. We derive an axis of thermal adaptation that is independent of body size, extends the S-I model, and highlights interactions among physiological and morphological traits that allow endotherms to persist in a wide range of temperatures. Our macrophysiological and macroecological analyses support our predictions that shifts in BMR and thermal conductance confer important adaptations to environmental temperature in both birds and mammals."

        "Abstract": "The relationships among species' physiological capacities and the geographical variation of ambient climate are of key importance to understanding the distribution of life on the Earth. Furthermore, predictions of how species will respond to climate change will profit from the explicit consideration of their physiological tolerances. The climatic variability hypothesis, which predicts that climatic tolerances are broader in more variable climates, provides an analytical framework for studying these relationships between physiology and biogeography. However, direct empirical support for the hypothesis is mostly lacking for endotherms, and few studies have tried to integrate physiological data into assessments of species' climatic vulnerability at the global scale. Here, we test the climatic variability hypothesis for endotherms, with a comprehensive dataset on thermal tolerances derived from physiological experiments, and use these data to assess the vulnerability of species to projected climate change. We find the expected relationship between thermal tolerance and ambient climatic variability in birds, but not in mammals-a contrast possibly resulting from different adaptation strategies to ambient climate via behaviour, morphology or physiology. We show that currently most of the species are experiencing ambient temperatures well within their tolerance limits and that in the future many species may be able to tolerate projected temperature increases across significant proportions of their distributions. However, our findings also underline the high vulnerability of tropical regions to changes in temperature and other threats of anthropogenic global changes. Our study demonstrates that a better understanding of the interplay among species' physiology and the geography of climate change will advance assessments of species' vulnerability to climate change. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

        "Abstract": "With the world continuously warming, a mechanistic understanding of how temperature affects interaction strengths, which are fundamental to food-web stability, is needed. As interaction strengths are determined by the flows of energy from resources to consumers, we investigated effects of temperature on animal energetics. We used newly compiled datasets on respiration rates and assimilation efficiencies to assess how temperature affects the energy use (respiration rates) and the efficiency of energy gain (assimilation efficiency) for different consumer types. Furthermore, we incorporated our findings in a simulation of temperature effects on maintenance feeding rates (i.e. energy consumption necessary to sustain life). Our analysis revealed a generally positive temperature dependence of assimilation efficiencies across consumer types thus implying a net energy gain with warming. The temperature scaling of respiration rates did not differ between consumer types. Based on these parameters we calculated maintenance feeding rates and compared them to empirically measured (realized) feeding rates. This comparison revealed that detritivores and herbivores have the potential to increase their biomasses under warming as their maintenance feeding rates increase less strongly than their realized feeding rates. For carnivores, however, we found a stronger increase of their maintenance feeding rates compared to their realized feeding rates, which should lead to decreased population sizes under warming. Overall, our results increase the understanding of climate change effects on ecosystems as they suggest profound energetic consequences for natural communities. © 2017 The Authors"
