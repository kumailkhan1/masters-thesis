Here, a self-powered photodetector (PD) based on an Ag/β-Ga2O3 Schottky heterojunction was designed and fabricated. Through a subtle design of electrodes, the pyro-phototronic effect was discovered, which can be coupled to the common photovoltaic effect and further enhance the performance of the PD. Compared to traditional Ga2O3-based PD, the as-used PD exhibited a self-driving property and a broadband response beyond the bandgap limitations, ranging from 200 nm (deep UV) to 980 nm (infrared). Moreover, the photoresponse time was greatly shrunk owing to the coupling effect. Under laser irradiation, with a wavelength of 450 nm and a power density of 8 mW cm‒2, the photocurrent could be improved by around 41 times compared with the sole photovoltaic effect. Besides, the performances of the Schottky PD were enhanced at both high and low temperatures. The device also possessed long-term working stability. This paper not only reveals basic physics lying in the 4th generation semiconductor Ga2O3 but also sheds light on the multi-encryption transmission of light information using this PD. © 2024"

EMRs are often shared to ensure accurate diagnosis, predict prognosis, and provide health advice. However, the process of sharing EMRs always raises significant concerns about potential security issues and breaches of privacy. Previous research has demonstrated that centralized cloud-based EMR systems are at high risk, e.g., single points of failure, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and insider attacks. With this motivation, we propose an EMR sharing scheme based on a consortium blockchain that is designed to prioritize both security and privacy. The interplanetary file system (IPFS) is used to store the encrypted EMR while the returned hash addresses are recorded on the blockchain. Then, the user can authorize other users to decrypt the EMR ciphertext via the proxy re-encryption algorithm, ensuring that only authorized personnel may access the files. Moreover, the scheme attains personalized access control and guarantees privacy protection by employing attribute-based access control. The safety analysis shows that the designed scheme meets the expected design goals. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that the scheme outperforms the comparison schemes in terms of computation and communication costs. © The Author(s) 2024."

Current and future QKD network requires addressing different set of challenges apart from distance, key rate and quantum security. In this regard, we present ChaQra—a sub quantum network with core features as 1. Crypto agility (integration in the already deployed telecommunication fibres). 2. Software defined networking (SDN paradigm for routing different nodes). 3. reliability (addressing denial-of-service with hybrid quantum safe cryptography). 4. upgradability (modules upgradation based on scientific and technological advancements). 5.

Using a strongly connected graph inverse approach, the resulting HDDCS is demonstrated to satisfy Devaney's definition of chaos. These HDDCSs are then efficiently implemented in digital circuits. Furthermore, we propose a novel method for generating measurement matrices using the designed HDDCS, which are utilized in compressive sensing-based image encryption techniques. Compared to traditional deterministic random matrices, the proposed HDDCS-based matrices offer significant improvements in terms of implementation efficiency, storage requirements, and robustness to noise. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior reconstruction outcomes and effectively obscures image correlations. This work not only contributes to the development of HDDCSs but also diversifies the methods for constructing measurement matrices in image encryption, providing a more secure and efficient alternative. © 2024"

One prominent feature of a squeezed light is its lower fluctuation and more randomness in a pair of orthogonal oriented quadratures, thus it prompts a significant application in not only quantum information and quantum precision measurement but also an excellent entropy source for true random number generation. Here we report a generation of a high-efficiency semi-device-independent quantum random number based on a broadband squeezed light, where a reliable randomness source is unnecessary and a noisy local oscillator is allowed for homodyne detection. The equivalent generation of private random bits is at a rate of 580.7 Mbps.

In contrast, we propose a novel secure transmission framework that combines noise entropy with reciprocity entropy, achieved by inserting reciprocity entropy into the frozen bits of polar codes. Note that in real-world scenarios, when eavesdroppers employ polynomial-time attacks, the bit error rate (BER) increases due to the introduction of computational entropy. To achieve indistinguishability security, we convert the practical physical layer security metric, BER, into the average min-entropy, a widely accepted concept in cryptography. The simulation results demonstrate that the eavesdropper’s BER can be significantly increased without compromising the communication performance of the legitimate receiver. Under concrete parameters we selected, when compared to the joint scheme of physical layer key generation and one time pad, the modular semantically-secure scheme based on the wire-tap channel model, and the simple channel entropy combination scheme, our scheme achieves a message rate approximately 1.2 times, 3.8 times, and 1.4 times better, respectively.

Each block contains a cryptographic hash function of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data, which are permanently stored in thousands of nodes and never altered. This provides a potential real-world application for generating a permanent, decentralized record of scientific data, taking advantage of blockchain features such as timestamping and immutability. Implementation: Here, we propose INNBC DApp, a Web3 decentralized application providing a simple front-end user interface connected with a smart contract for recording scientific data on a modern, proof-of-stake (POS) blockchain such as BNB Smart Chain. Unlike previously proposed blockchain tools that only store a hash of the data on-chain, here the data are stored fully on-chain within the transaction itself as “transaction input data”, with a true decentralized storage solution. In addition to plain text, the DApp can record various types of files, such as documents, images, audio, and video, by using Base64 encoding. In this study, we describe how to use the DApp and perform real-world transactions storing different kinds of data from previously published research articles, describing the advantages and limitations of using such a technology, analyzing the cost in terms of transaction fees, and discussing possible use cases. Results: We have been able to store several different types of data on the BNB Smart Chain: raw text, documents, images, audio, and video. Notably, we stored several complete research articles at a reasonable cost. We found a limit of 95KB for each single file upload. Considering that Base64 encoding increases file size by approximately 33%, this provides us with a theoretical limit of 126KB. We successfully overcome this limitation by splitting larger files into smaller chunks and uploading them as multi-volume archives. Additionally, we propose AES encryption to protect sensitive data. Accordingly, we show that it is possible to include enough data to be useful for storing and sharing scientific documents and images on the blockchain at a reasonable cost for the users. Conclusion: INNBC DApp represents a real use case for blockchain technology in decentralizing biomedical data storage and sharing, providing us with features such as immutability, timestamp, and identity that can be used to ensure permanent availability of the data and to provide proof-of-existence as well as to protect authorship, a freely available decentralized science (DeSci) tool aiming to help bring mass adoption of blockchain technology among the scientific community. © The Author(s) 2024."

In this work, we introduce a novel protocol for multi-channel optical information encoding and encryption using vectorial spatial coherence engineering of a partially coherent light beam. By characterizing the beam’s spatial coherence structure with a 2×2 coherence matrix, we demonstrate independent control over the three components of the coherence Stokes vector. This allows for three-channel optical information encoding and encryption, with applications in color image representation. Unlike existing methods based on fully coherent light modulations, our approach utilizes a two-point dependent coherence Stokes vector, proving resilient to random noise in experimental scenarios. Our findings provide a robust foundation for higher-dimensional optical encoding and encryption, addressing limitations associated with partially coherent light in complex environments. © The Author(s) 2024."

However, the traditional port supply chain suffers from poor flexibility of centralized authority management, data asymmetry, low efficiency of encrypted data retrieval and high delay of data update. Therefore, a secure storage and sharing scheme for port supply chain data based on blockchain assistance is proposed in this work. First, a fine-grained access control model for the port supply chain is designed in the smart contract to achieve auditable and decentralized management of user privileges. Second, the whole process of dynamic searchable encrypted data storage and access is realized in the smart contract, which ensures data security and encrypted data access efficiency. Moreover, an off-chain auxiliary storage method is designed to alleviate the storage pressure of the blockchain. Moreover, a reliable smart contract interface is provided for user operation, which can effectively regulate the access and storage of data. In addition, a consensus mechanism for the port supply chain is proposed, which takes the credibility and seniority of the operators at all levels as an indicator of the consensus agreement rights and interests. It improves the consensus efficiency under the premise of guaranteeing the security of the consensus process and meets the high data throughput demand of the supply chain system. Finally, the proposed scheme is implemented in Hyperledger Fabric. The security analysis and experimental results show that our scheme is secure and efficient in large-scale port supply chain data scenarios, and the system is scalable. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Traditional optical encryption devices rely on phase, amplitude, and even polarization modulation, with the phase typically produced by the phase accumulation effect of diffractive elements in space, which requires a gradual change in the medium's refractive index and thickness to achieve. This also causes the shortcomings of traditional optical encryption devices such as large volume, high design complexity and poor resolution, which is not conducive to miniaturization. Metasurface, as a two-dimensional form of metamaterials, has artificial sub-wavelength structure, which can flexibly manipulate the phase, amplitude, wavelength and orbital angular momentum of electromagnetic waves by changing the shape, size, spin and arrangement of meta-atoms. Due to the design flexibility of the metasurface and its arbitrary wavefront operation, more and more research is linking it to efficient and reliable encryption devices in the future. This paper introduces the control of metasurface on single dimension, double dimension and three-dimensional degree of freedom of electromagnetic wave to realize information encryption, and other dimensions such as spatial frequency control and some common computational imaging encryption algorithms, and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of these encryption methods. Compared with traditional optical encryption devices, metasurface encryption has the advantages of compact, high resolution and high security factor, and has a good development prospect. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Existing indexing methods primarily target the creation of a single-structured blockchain, resulting in extensive time and memory requirements. As the scale of domain data continues to grow exponentially, master–slave blockchain systems face increasingly severe challenges with regards to low query efficiency and extended traceback times. To address these issues, this paper propose a multi-level index construction method for the master–slave blockchain (MLI). Firstly, MLI introduces a weight matrix and partitions the entire master–slave blockchain based on the master chain structure, the weight of each partition is assigned. Secondly, for the master blockchain in each partition, a master chain index construction method based on jump consistent hash (JHMI) is proposed, which takes the key value of the nodes and the number of index slots as input and outputs the master chain index. Finally, a bloom filter is introduced to improve the column-based selection function and build a secondary composite index on the subordinate blockchain corresponding to each master block. Experimental results on three constraint conditions and two types of datasets demonstrate that the proposed method reduce the index construction time by an average of 9.28%, improve the query efficiency by 12.07%, and reduce the memory overhead by 24.4%. © The Author(s) 2024."

This feature allows users to distribute data to particular recipients, while also allowing data proprietors to selectively grant access to their data to users. Ensuring data security and privacy is a formidable task when selective data is acquired and exchanged. One potential issue that emerges is the risk that data may be transmitted by cloud servers to unauthorized users or individuals who have no interest in the particular data or user interests. The prior research lacks comprehensive solutions for balancing security, privacy, and usability in secure data selective sharing schemes inside Cloud-Based decentralized trust management systems. Motivating factors for settling this gap contain growing concerns concerning data privacy, the necessity for scalable and interoperable frameworks, and the increasing dependency on cloud services for data storage and sharing, which necessitates robust and user-friendly mechanisms for secure data management. An effective and obviously secure data selective sharing and acquisition mechanism for cloud-based systems is proposed in this work. We specifically start by important a common problematic related to the selective collection and distribution of data in cloud-based systems. To address these issues, this study proposes a Cloud-based Decentralized Trust Management System (DTMS)-connected Efficient, Provably Secure Data Selection Sharing Scheme (EPSDSS). The EPSDSS approach employs attribute-based encryption (ABE) and proxy re-encryption (PRE) to provide fine-grained access control over shared data. A decentralized trust management system provides participant dependability and accountability while mitigating the dangers of centralized trust models. The EPSDSS-PRE paradigm would allow data owners to regulate granular access while allowing users to customize data collection without disclosing their preferences. In our strategy, the EPSDSS recognizes shared data and generates short fingerprints for information that can elude detection before cloud storage. DTMS also computes user trustworthiness and improves user behaviour administration. Our research demonstrates that it’s able to deliver trustworthy and safe data sharing features in cloud-based environments, making it a viable option for enterprises seeking to protect sensitive data while maximizing collaboration and utilization of resources. © The Author(s) 2024."

After its proposal, various schemes have been introduced to achieve advanced privacy protection. Regrettably, all the schemes based on number theoretic assumptions are insecure under quantum computers, and the known post-quantum designs are impractical because of the overhead cost (> 10 MB). To fill the gap, we present the first isogeny-based secret handshake scheme (i.e., ISH) with a friendly communication cost (67 KB). In particular, we apply the CSI-FiSh signature scheme to generate group keys and credentials. For each zero-knowledge transcript in the credential, we generate a signature for handshake via the Fiat–Shamir paradigm, while it fails anonymous authentication. To fix the issue, we modify the Fiat–Shamir-type signature by embedding the CSIDH ephemeral private key into the challenge space. After verifying the modified signatures, two users recover the right ephemeral private key if they are in the same group, then they can negotiate a session key and authenticate each other. Our scheme is proved secure under the Group Action Inverse Problems (GAIP) in the random oracle model, and deniability, as an attractive property, also holds for ISH, enabling user's ability to deny their interactions in the finished handshakes. Via choosing appropriate parameters, the communication cost surpasses all the existing post-quantum secret handshakes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Generating the S-box with optimal cryptographic properties is one of cryptography's most challenging combinatorial problems because of its enormous search space, lack of guidance, and conflicting performance criteria. This paper introduces a novel Chaotic Opposition-based Learning Initialized Hybrid Algebraic-Heuristic (COBLAH) algorithm, combining the favorable traits of Algebraic and heuristics methods based on Galois field inversion, affine mapping, and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The Galois field inversion and affine mapping are used to construct the S-box, while the GA guides the algebraic construction to find the best bit-matrix and additive vector based on any irreducible polynomial for GF(28). GA initializes with a random population generated using a newly constructed cosine-cubic map incorporated with binarization and Opposition-based Learning (OBL). Further, Multi-Objective Optimization Ratio Analysis (MOORA) is utilized to identify the best S-box from the final optimized population. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by comparing the generated COBLAH S-box with more than twenty state-of-the-art S-boxes, including Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Skipjack, Gray, and Affine Power Affine (APA). The COBLAH S-box has nonlinearity 112, Strict Avalanche Criterion (SAC) offset 0.0202, Distance to SAC (DSAC) 332, Differential Approximation Probability (DP) 0.0625, Linear Approximation Probability (LP) 0.0156, Bit Independence Criterion-Strict Avalanche Criterion (BIC-SAC) 0.50006, and Bit Independence Criterion-Nonlinearity (BIC-NL) 112, which stands as the optimal observed thus far. The absence of fixed and opposite fixed points and the fact that it adheres to a single cycle aligns the COBLAH S-box with an ideal S-box. In addition, an image encryption mechanism is utilized to encrypt and decrypt the different images sourced from the standard USC-SIPI image dataset using COBLAH S-box and compared against different state-of-the-art S-boxes based on various image characteristics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Utilized photosensitive molecules to investigate the photocatalytic characteristics of 4-nitrobenzenethiol (4-NBT) on three substrates. Excitation light at a wavelength of 633 nm enables local photocatalytic for information signals writing, while 785 nm wavelength excitation light combined with two-dimensional Mapping technology is used for information signal reading. Read information signals are often prone to reading errors due to their own lack of resolution or strong interference from back bottom signals, so error correction processing of information signals is essential.

Many security issues are faced by chaos-based cryptosystems because of their less complexity. Hence, a new Cosine-Cosine chaotic map characterized by intricate chaotic behaviour is designed in the current study. Additionally, we formulate an original video encryption scheme employing this Cosine-Cosine chaotic map. The encryption process involves five steps, beginning with the segmentation of the original video into frames based on its frame rate. In the second phase, a 384 bits pseudorandom key is generated that is further divided into three subkeys of 128 bits each. The novel Cosine-Cosine chaotic map-based sequence is generated.

Attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme is considered a powerful encryption technique that offers flexible and fine-grained access control capabilities. Further, the multi-user collaborative access ABE scheme additionally supports users to acquire access authorization through collaborative works. However, the existing multi-user collaborative access ABE schemes do not consider the different weights of collaboration users. Therefore, using these schemes for weighted multi-user collaborative access results in redundant attributes, which inevitably reduces the efficiency of the ABE scheme. This paper proposes a revocable and verifiable weighted attribute-based encryption with collaborative access scheme (RVWABE-CA), which can provide efficient weighted multi-user collaborative access, user revocation, and data integrity verification, as the fundamental cornerstone for establishing a robust framework to facilitate secure sharing of electronic health records in a public cloud environment. In detail, this scheme employs a novel weighted access tree to eliminate redundant attributes, utilizes encryption version information to control user revocation, and establishes Merkle Hash Tree for data integrity verification. We prove that our scheme is resistant against chosen plaintext attack. The experimental results demonstrate that our scheme has significant computational efficiency advantages compared to related works, without increasing storage or communication overhead. Therefore, the RVWABE-CA scheme can provide an efficient and flexible weighted collaborative access control and user revocation mechanism as well as data integrity verification for electronic health record systems. © The Author(s) 2024."

Tools for low frequency quantum experiments are not suitable for penetrant radiation, consequently we need to use effects typical to the keV-MeV energy range instead. High energy photon protocols would include fundamental properties testing, industrial imaging, quantum random number generators, quantum simulators, military applications and improvement of already existing medical procedures. In this paper we review some important steps in the study of annihilation photon correlations, we point out the experimental differences and necessities with respect to the energy increase in quantum photonic experiments and we describe the design of a quantum gamma device we propose for experiments meant to prove feasibility of gamma ray based protocols.

Despite the rapid development of multiplexed metaholograms through exploiting different physical dimensions of photons such as polarization, amplitude, wavelength, and angular momentum, the multiplexing channel is approaching its limit due to the almost exhausted existing physical dimensions of photons. Here we demonstrate the higher-order Poincaré sphere (HOPS)-multiplexed holography by exploiting vector beam on the HOPS as a new physical dimension for holographic multiplexing. The underlying mechanism relies on independent control of phase shifts in two spin eigenstates to modulate the vector beam induced fields. As proof of concept, we demonstrate a meta-hologram with four multiplexing channels that exhibit independent holographic images when the incident beams are on the −2nd order, −1st order, 1st order and 2nd order HOPS, respectively. Moreover, leveraging the unique characteristic of HOPS-multiplexed holography, high-security optical anti-counterfeiting and information encryption have been demonstrated as well.

An early prognosis is the only possible way of increasing survival rate. One of the key elements of this context is the healthcare digitalization that is carried out through Internet of Things (IoTs) and cloud computing. However, main issue in cloud with IoT is false diagnosis, which leads to cause a major impact on patient's life. Moreover, data communication through cloud servers can be compromised by attackers due to security issues. Therefore, to overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel secure e-healthcare system with dual objectives- accurate disease prediction and improved cloud security. A novel diagnosis approach ‘Hybrid Binary Particle Firefly Optimized Extreme Learning Machine classifier (HybBPF-ELM)’ to predict HD is designed, that recognize the subject with HD abnormality from the normal ones. The prediction accuracy and time efficiency of training process are improved by the adoption of a Hybrid Binary Particle Firefly Optimizer (HBPFO) through fine-tuning weight and bias of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier. Additionally, a new intelligent encryption and decryption framework ‘IEDF’ is introduced for cloud security. It combines four encryption algorithms, including Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Data Encryption Standard (DES), Rivest- Shamir-Adleman (RSA), and Modified Blow Fish (MBF) to enhance cryptographic strength and key security. Along with this, an Automatic Sequence Encryption (ASC) for data block encryption is employed to ensure strong security and network performance. The integration of HD prediction module and cloud security framework within e-healthcare system assists healthcare experts in securely storing and transferring data for advanced diagnosis. The results show that our proposed system achieves an overall prediction accuracy of 99.36 % and less processing time for encryption and decryption of 127.55 s and 452.01 s at 2.2 GB file size respectively. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Semiconductor quantum dots are ideal candidates for solid-state quantum emitters as these artificial atoms have large dipole moments and a quantum confined energy level structure, enabling the realization of single photon sources with high repetition rates and high single photon purity. Quantum dots may also be triggered using a laser pulse for on-demand operation. The naturally-occurring size variations in ensembles of quantum dots offers the potential to increase the bandwidth of quantum communication systems through wavelength-division multiplexing, but conventional laser triggering schemes based on Rabi rotations are ineffective when applied to inequivalent emitters.

The general practice of single-diffraction computation for synthesizing holograms can only provide an approximate answer, which is subject to limitations in numerical implementation. Various non-convex optimization algorithms are thus designed to seek an optimal solution by introducing different constraints, frameworks, and initializations. Herein, we overview the optimization algorithms applied to computer-generated holography, incorporating principles of hologram synthesis based on alternative projections and gradient descent methods.

The security of information transmitted online has grown to be a critical concern, particularly in the transfer of medical data. To overcome this, the data must be delivered securely without being altered or lost. This can be possibly done by combining the principles of cryptography and steganography. In the recent past, steganography is used with simpler methods like the least significant bit manipulation technique, in order to encode a lower-resolution image into a higher-resolution image. Here, we attempt to use deep neural networks to combine many two-dimensional colour images of the same resolution into a single cover image with the same resolution. In this technique, many secret images are concealed inside a single cover image using deep neural networks. The embedded cover image is then encrypted using a 3D chaotic map for diffusion and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for confusion to increase security.Supporting the fact that neural networks experience losses, the proposed system recovers up to 93% of the hidden image concealed in the original image. As the secret image features are identified and combined along with the cover image, the time complexity involved in the security process is minimized by 78% compared to securing the original data. © The Author(s) 2024."

It is essential to implement an encryption approach with access control to give less complex, more flexible, and safe access to sensitive data. In this work, a novel lightweight chaotic encryption approach with fuzzy access control is presented to encrypt light images in the IoT domain, while maintaining image quality. With the aid of multiplexer modeling and information shift register technology, the algorithm’s design combines random and chaotic mapping approach based on a specific password key with a predetermined number of fuzzy logic shifts on the password key for the image pixels. Further, to extract the private key with complexity and boost defense against attacks, a shift register and logical xor combination is employed. The simulation of the proposed model for AVR microcontroller has been done under MATLAB software and the design of various encryption components has been used to implement lightweight mapping. The proposed system has been evaluated in terms of histogram analysis, adjacent pixel correlation analysis, contrast analysis, homogeneity analysis, energy analysis, NIST analysis, error mean square analysis, information entropy, pixel number change rate, integrated mean change intensity, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and time complexity. Remarkably, the proposed technique has demonstrated high efficiency.

However, adequate and precise tuning over CPL in polymer-based materials remains challenging due to the difficulty in regulating chiral structures. Herein, visualized full-color CPL is achieved by doping red, green, and blue quantum dots (QDs) into reconfigurable blue phase liquid crystal elastomers (BPLCEs). In contrast to the CPL signal observed in cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs), the chiral 3D cubic superstructure of BPLCEs induces an opposite CPL signal. Notably, this effect is entirely independent of photonic bandgaps (PBGs) and results in a high glum value, even without matching between PBGs and the emission bands of QDs. Meanwhile, the lattice structure of the BPLCEs can be reversibly switched via mechanical stretching force, inducing on-off switching of the CPL signals, and these variations can be further fixed using dynamic disulfide bonds in the BPLCEs. Moreover, the smart polymer-based CPL systems using the BPLCEs for anti-counterfeiting and information encryption have been demonstrated, suggesting the great potential of the BPLCEs-based CPL active materials. © The Author(s) 2024."

Among all possible candidates, epitaxial quantum dots are currently emerging as one of the brightest sources of highly entangled photons. However, the optimization of both brightness and entanglement currently requires different technologies that are difficult to combine in a scalable manner. In this work, we overcome this challenge by developing a novel device consisting of a quantum dot embedded in a circular Bragg resonator, in turn, integrated onto a micromachined piezoelectric actuator. The resonator engineers the light-matter interaction to empower extraction efficiencies up to 0.69(4). Simultaneously, the actuator manipulates strain fields that tune the quantum dot for the generation of entangled photons with corrected fidelities to a maximally entangled state up to 0.96(1). This hybrid technology has the potential to overcome the limitations of the key rates that plague QD-based entangled sources for entanglement-based quantum key distribution and entanglement-based quantum networks. © The Author(s) 2024."

In this paper, we report findings from a two-phase empirical study into the views of entanglement held by pre-service physics teachers and physics students from various universities. In the first phase, we utilized a questionnaire consisting of open-ended questions which was completed by 31 pre-service physics teachers. The study participants’ ideas were explored using qualitative content analysis which led to the creation of rating scale items used in study phase 2. These items were administered to a broader cohort including 73 physics university students in order to capture the learners’ agreement or disagreement with the questionnaire statements, and hence, helped to validate and substantiate the in-depth insights from study phase 1. Key findings revealed widespread accurate notions, like the need to consider the entire system when examining entangled states. However, less elaborated views were also identified, including ideas such as that measurements of entangled states always show perfect (anti-)correlation. Another striking observation was the confusion between quantum entanglement and superposition. In the case of quantum teleportation, many participants seemed to have a basic grasp of the concept, although a number of misconceptions were apparent, notably the idea that quantum entanglement enables faster-than-light communication. Practically, the findings can assist educators in anticipating and addressing widespread (mis-)conceptions, paving the way for more effective instruction in quantum mechanics and its real-world applications, such as quantum cryptography and computing. © The Author(s) 2024."

In particular, we can switch on decoherence-free (DF) modes in the storage stage by placing the poles on the imaginary axis via a coherent feedback control scheme, and these memory modes can further be simultaneously made robust against perturbations to the system parameters by minimizing the condition number associated with imaginary poles. The DF modes can also be switched off by tuning the controller parameters to place the poles in the left half of the complex plane in the writing/reading stage. We develop explicit algebraic conditions guiding the design of such a coherent quantum controller, which involves employing an augmented system model to counter the influence of unknown inputs.

Experts can create precise queries due to their prior knowledge, while non-experts struggle with specific terms and concepts, making their queries less precise. Cloud infrastructure offers a practical and scalable platform for data owners to upload their data, making it accessible to intended data users. However, the contemporary single-owner/single-user (S/S) approach to DLSS schemes falls short of effectively leveraging the inherent multi-user capabilities of cloud infrastructure. Furthermore, most of these schemes delegate the dissemination of secret keys to a single trust point within the mutual distrust scenario in cloud infrastructure. This paper proposes a Secure Semantic Search using Deep Learning in a Blockchain-Assisted Multi-User Setting (S3DBMS) . Specifically, the seamless integration of attribute-based encryption with transfer learning allows the construction of DLSS in multi-owner/multi-user (M/M) settings. Further, blockchain’s smart contract mechanism allows a multi-attribute authority consensus-based generation of user private keys and system-wide global parameters in a mutual distrust M/M scenario.

To improve upon the traditional bilayer structure with limited color information and single decoding mode, this work developed an ethanol-responsive structure with multi-level information encryption ability by inserting a functional layer into two shielding layers (red Layer A with a photonic stop band (PSB) at 640 nm and green Layer C with a PSB at 530 nm). The functional layer was composed of colorless Layer B, a quick response (QR) code pattern made of TiO2 nanoparticles, and a dense polymer. Due to the isolation of distinct layers, different reflectance values, and different PSB positions of the three-layer IOPC, the structural color of Layer B could only be “turned on” by wetting the entire structure when its PSB redshifted from 360 nm to 460 nm. Specifically, when either side was individually wetted, the PSB of Layer A or C redshifted to 825 nm or 685 nm, and the color of the QR code was dominated by the unwetted red or green layer. After the entire structure had been soaked, the blue QR code was decoded. Meanwhile, when the detecting angle increased from 5° to 60°, the PSBs of Layers B and C in the wetted three-layer IOPC blueshifted from 460 nm to 365 nm and from 685 nm to 540 nm, respectively, which resulted in a cascade decoding process with a single- or mixed-color output. This structure provides a good foundation for multi-level information encryption. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

However, images uploaded to the cloud will face new privacy threats. Image privacy can be effectively protected using traditional encryption methods, but the encrypted images are snowflake-like noisy images, which makes the images unusable. Lately, Thumbnail Preserving Encryption (TPE) is proposed, which relieves this conflict between image availability and privacy in cloud platforms by retaining thumbnails unchanged after encryption. Existing TPE schemes for intra-block grouping usually utilize a lot of pseudo-random functions with high computational complexity, which makes encryption and decryption time too long. We propose a new model, block-churning, and propose a new TPE scheme based on this model. In this scheme, all pixels in the block are churned as a whole. This fundamentally solves the problem of low encryption efficiency caused by intra-block grouping, and greatly improves the encryption speed, while being able to change pixel values more significantly in blocks. The experiment shows that the encrypted image achieves a good balance between availability and privacy. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The aforesaid result is achieved by introducing a new hinting mechanism that allows parties to collaboratively calculate HighBits. Our hinting mechanism allows public key compression similar to Dilithium. Additionally, we suggest an optimization technique to minimize number of restarts both parties need to produce a valid signature. Our approach allows to produce ≈10 KB signatures within 3 rounds of communication.

We analyzed different design metrics on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and compared the metrics of the PRIDE implementation with the well-known cipher PRESENT. This gives us an insight into the efficiency and reliability of PRIDE in IoT-constrained environments. We also proposed different architectures of the PRIDE cipher for 16-bit and 32-bit datapaths. © 2024"

Hence, to maximize the security concern, federated learning and the blockchain were introduced. But, in some cases, security issues arose because of the extensive unstructured data and attack vulnerability. So, to avoid security problems and offer better protection in a cloud environment, a novel Optimized Buffalo-based Homomorphic SHA Blockchain (OBHSB) is proposed. In this model for accessing the cloud storage data with the critical matching method, if any of the unauthenticated users are trying to access the file initially, the system checks the key matching parameter. The proposed model was developed to provide better security in big data presented in the cloud environment. Hence, federated learning was adopted to create the cloud auditing phase in the distributed cloud environment. Therefore, it gives flexibility in training all data types: audio, text, and images. Moreover, the prime performance parameters were calculated and compared with other traditional approaches to justify the efficiency of the proposed model. The attack was considered an event in this research. The performance rate of the proposed model was validated in the performance analysis. Subsequently, the case study was developed in this research to explain the working procedure of the proposed design, and the result of the proposed model was discussed. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

How to obtain real 3D scene and generate high fidelity hologram in real time is an urgent problem. Here, we propose a liquid lens based holographic camera for real 3D scene hologram acquisition using an end-to-end physical model-driven network (EEPMD-Net). As the core component of the liquid camera, the first 10 mm large aperture electrowetting-based liquid lens is proposed by using specially fabricated solution. The design of the liquid camera ensures that the multi-layers of the real 3D scene can be obtained quickly and with great imaging performance. The EEPMD-Net takes the information of real 3D scene as the input, and uses two new structures of encoder and decoder networks to realize low-noise phase generation. By comparing the intensity information between the reconstructed image after depth fusion and the target scene, the composite loss function is constructed for phase optimization, and the high-fidelity training of hologram with true depth of the 3D scene is realized for the first time. The holographic camera achieves the high-fidelity and fast generation of the hologram of the real 3D scene, and the reconstructed experiment proves that the holographic image has the advantage of low noise. The proposed holographic camera is unique and can be used in 3D display, measurement, encryption and other fields. © The Author(s) 2024."

Over several years, the massive assimilation of IoT devices has given rise to smart cities, smart factories, smart farms, etc. While IoTs can collect immense amounts of user and environmental information, the lack of adequate security measures is among the major concerns about information security and privacy. With the ever-increasing presence of IoTs, information flow between IoT devices in a single or multi-layered network is becoming increasingly vulnerable to attacks. Although several software-based solutions have been developed over the years that improve the security of resource-constrained IoT devices, there are limited efforts on hardware-oriented IoT security solutions. This paper proposes a Trusted HArdware-based Scalable Secure Architecture (THASSA) for IoT Edge systems. Leveraging standard cryptographic algorithms, THASSA provides a secure mechanism for data transfer and off-loads cryptography operations to trusted hardware. The modularized THASSA architecture allows devices to be added or removed without user intervention. Also, THASSA could be scaled to multiple subsystems using multiple trusted hardware to form IoT clusters with secure data path(s) for mission-critical applications. An experimental study has verified the correctness and effectiveness of THASSA. © The Author(s) 2024."

To safeguard privacy, we suggest an image encryption scheme that combines data hiding and image encryption. The proposed scheme successfully decrypts images after JPEG compression attacks and preserves the privacy of secret regions through the use of block scrambling encryption based on region selection. Simultaneously, the scheme can handle nonuniform secret regions and obtain more sensitive secret keys because of the incorporation of a chaotic system. The enhanced deep learning-based data-hiding technology reduces algorithm complexity by enabling the encryption position to be determined in the decryption phase without the need for any information or equipment. However, this approach also increases algorithm security, because only when the right secret data are extracted can they be decrypted successfully. According to the experimental findings, the proposed scheme can correctly decrypt images via JPEG compression while maintaining visually acceptable quality. The proposed scheme can achieve greater robustness against image processing algorithms and a wider secret key space than traditional schemes. © The Author(s) 2024."

The leading candidate to generate such pairs is based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in non-linear crystals. However, its pair extraction efficiency is limited to 0.1% when operating at near-unity fidelity due to multiphoton emission at high brightness. Quantum dots in photonic nanostructures can in principle overcome this limit, but the devices with high entanglement fidelity (99%) have low pair extraction efficiency (0.01%). Here, we show a measured peak entanglement fidelity of 97.5% ± 0.8% and pair extraction efficiency of 0.65% from an InAsP quantum dot in an InP photonic nanowire waveguide. We show that the generated oscillating two-photon Bell state can establish a secure key for peer-to-peer QKD. Using our time-resolved QKD scheme alleviates the need to remove the quantum dot energy splitting of the intermediate exciton states in the biexciton-exciton cascade. © The Author(s) 2024."

Multi-channel metaholograms, capable of switching between multiple projected images based on the properties of illuminating light such as state of polarization and angle of incidence, have emerged as a promising solution for realizing switchable and dynamic holographic displays. Yet, existing designs typically grapple with challenges such as limited multiplexing channels and unwanted crosstalk, which severely constrain their practical use. Here, we present a new type of waveguide-based multi-channel metaholograms, which support six independent and fully crosstalk-free holographic display channels, simultaneously multiplexed by the spin and angle of guided incident light within the glass waveguide. We employ a k-space translation strategy that allows each of the six distinct target images to be selectively translated from evanescent-wave region to the center of propagation-wave region and projected into free space without crosstalk, when the metahologram is under illumination of a guided light with specific spin and azimuthal angle. In addition, by tailoring the encoded target images, we implement a three-channel polarization-independent metahologram and a two-channel full-color (RGB) metahologram. Moreover, the number of multiplexing channels can be further increased by expanding the k-space’s central-period region or combing the k-space translation strategy with other multiplexing techniques such as orbital angular momentum multiplexing. Our work provides a novel approach towards realization of high-performance and compact holographic optical elements with substantial information capacity, opening avenues for applications in AR/VR displays, image encryption, and information storage. © The Author(s) 2024."

With the advent of quantum computers, traditional cryptography techniques are at risk. In this work, we present a cryptography idea using logical phi-bits, which are classical analogues of quantum bits (qubits) and are supported by driven acoustic metamaterials. The state of phi-bits displays superpositions similar to quantum bits, with complex amplitudes and phases. We present a representation of the state vector of single and multi-phi-bit systems. The state vector of multiple phi-bits system lies in a complex exponentially scaling Hilbert space and is used to encode information or messages. By changing the driving conditions of the metamaterial, the information can be encrypted with exceptional security and efficiency. We illustrate experimentally the practicality and effectiveness of encoding and encryption of a message using a 5 phi-bits system and emphasize the scalability of this approach to an N phi-bits system with the same processing time. © The Author(s) 2024."

This is particularly important in applications that utilise existing, though limited, computational and data communication infrastructures. Furthermore, rural communities have growing concerns regarding the privacy, security, and ownership of the data produced within their agricultural fields. Load distribution in rural edge devices can enhance agricultural practices by improving resource usage, decision-making, and addressing network connectivity challenges. Managing resource utilisation in this way also improves economic investments made in managing and deploying edge devices in rural environments. In this work, we propose SHIELD, a security-aware load balancing framework, primarily designed for edge-based systems in rural areas. For handling environments with limited connectivity, SHIELD efficiently manages tasks and computational resources by categorising them into restricted, public and private, shared respectively. It also allocates tasks considering key performance factors such as completion time, resource utilisation, failure rate, and security. The framework is evaluated on a weed detection scenario in precision agriculture, using three federated learning (FL) variants (local model training, global model aggregation, and model prediction) with the ResNet-50 model trained on the DeepWeeds image classification dataset. The proposed framework also integrates encryption and task replication techniques for data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Experimental results show that SHIELD demonstrates an average of 23% (using Parsl), 29% (using OpenWhisk) improvement in failure rate and 18 s (Parsl), 13 s (OpenWhisk) average improvement in makespan compared to other task allocation approaches, such as secure variants of random, round robin, and least loaded. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The realization of these platforms hinges on the intelligent application of multiplexing techniques, seamlessly combined with appropriate metasurface technology. Nevertheless, existing multi-channel encryption technologies based on metasurfaces face challenges related to information leakage during partial channel decoding processes. In this paper, we present a reprogrammable metasurface for polarization modulation. This metasurface not only allows for the arbitrary customization of linearly polarized reflected waves but also enables real-time amplitude modulation. Here, relying on polarization amplitude control, a fully secure communication protocol is developed precisely in the terahertz (THz) spectrum to achieve real-time information encryption based on polarization modulation metasurfaces where access to information is highly restricted. The proposed metasurface employs the double random phase encryption (DRPE) algorithm for information encryption. It transmits the encrypted data through different polarization channels using two graphene nanoribbons, exclusively controlled by external biasing conditions. Various encryption scenarios have been outlined to fortify information protection against potential eavesdroppers. The simulated results show that this unique technology for hiding images by manipulating the polarization of the reflected wave provides new opportunities for various applications, including encryption, THz communications, THz secure data storage, and imaging. © The Author(s) 2024."

The mental and physical conditions monitoring of children at the age of 5–10 is necessary and it is the parent's duty. Nowadays, healthcare systems utilize the Internet of Things (IoT) for many purposes. The actuators and sensors are used in the IoT for providing treatments as well as monitoring the patient's health. For managing and sharing electronic medical records, blockchain plays an important role in securing the data. To track and monitor the patient's physiological conditions, IoT-based systems are useful. However, these approaches have some drawbacks. Privacy leakage and rollback attacks are common problems that occur in Permissioned blockchains, even if they provide better scalability and throughput. Due to the structure of blockchain, the data-retrieving process in healthcare monitoring systems is difficult. To solve these problems, we implemented a new machine learning-aided technique to monitor and secure the children's health data in the blockchain environment. Initially, the children's healthcare data are accumulated from the public data resources that are involved in the Hybrid Encryption Technique (HET). In the HET, techniques such as Elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) and Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) are integrated. After performing the encryption method effectively, the encrypted data are stored in the blockchain. Further, to perform the health monitoring, the doctor decrypted the data utilizing the same HET. In this approach, to monitor the children's health data, the Hybrid Adaptive Machine Learning (HAML) approach is adopted, which is the combination of both Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Here, parameters present in this approach are optimized with the support of the Modified Binary Battle Royale Optimizer (MBBRO) algorithm. In the end, the comparative estimation is performed with certain performance criteria to justify the effectiveness of the developed approach. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The imperative for robust data communication security has become increasingly evident with the pervasive adoption of cloud computing. However, challenges persist due to the inherent complexities and limited security measures in cloud environments, particularly in transmitting and storing sensitive information. Previous studies have underscored the intricate nature of intrusion detection systems (IDS) in cloud-based settings. In this research, a Multi scale Deep Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Neural Network and Optimal Encryption Scheme espoused Intrusion Detection and Secure Data Storage in the Cloud (MDBGRNN-ID-SCESOA) is proposed. Leveraging the KDD CUP 99 dataset and DS2OS Dataset, initial data preprocessing involves Domain Transform Filtering (DTF) for tokenization, dimension reduction, and semantic analysis. Subsequently, MDBGRNN is employed to discern intrusion from non-intrusion data. Furthermore, a two-way encryption mechanism, integrating Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) with the Sine Cosine Egret Swarm Optimization Algorithm (ECC-SCESOA), enhances data security while minimizing computational overhead. To safeguard encrypted data at rest in the cloud, a steganography process is devised, effectively concealing sensitive content. Performance evaluation metrics, including accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, encryption/decryption time, execution time, memory usage, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), demonstrate the efficacy of MDBGRNN-ID-SCESOA. Comparative analysis with existing techniques reveals notable enhancements in computational efficiency and data security.

As for the proposed MSQS protocol, it is the only semiquantum summation protocol which aims to accomplish the modulo d addition of more than three semiquantum users’ private integers.

However, perturbations caused by free-space atmospheric turbulence decrease the performance of the system by introducing random fluctuations in the transmittance of OAM photons. Currently, the theoretical performance analysis of OAM-encoded QKD systems exists a gap when concerning the statistical distribution under the free-space link. In this article, we analyzed the security of QKD systems by combining probability distribution of transmission coefficient (PDTC) of OAM with decoy-state BB84 method. To address the problem that the invalid key rate is calculated in the part transmittance interval of the post-processing process, an intelligent threshold method based on neural network is proposed to improve OAM-encoded QKD, which aims to conserve computing resources and enhance system efficiency. Our findings reveal that the ratio of root mean square (RMS) OAM-beam radius to Fried constant plays a crucial role in ensuring secure key generation. Meanwhile, the training error of neural network is at the magnitude around 10−3, indicating the ability to predict optimization parameters quickly and accurately. Our work contributes to the advancement of parameter optimization and prediction for free-space OAM-encoded HD-QKD systems.

However, as the number of IoT-connected devices increases, securing the IoT is becoming increasingly challenging. To tackle the increasing security challenges caused by the proliferation of IoT devices, this research proposes an innovative method for IoT identity authentication. The method is based on an improved ring-learning with errors (R-LWE) algorithm, which encrypts and decrypts communication between devices and servers effectively using polynomial modular multiplication and modular addition operations. The main innovation of this study is the improvement of the traditional R-LWE algorithm, enhancing its efficiency and security. Experimental results demonstrated that, when compared to number theory-based algorithms and elliptic curve cryptography algorithms at a 256-bit security level, the enhanced algorithm achieves significant advantages. The improved algorithm encrypted 20 data points with an average runtime of only 3.6 ms, compared to 7.3 ms and 7.7 ms for the other algorithms. Similarly, decrypting the same amount of data had an average runtime of 2.9 ms, as opposed to 7.3 ms and 8 ms for the other algorithms. Additionally, the improved R-LWE algorithm had significant advantages in terms of communication and storage costs. Compared to the number theory-based algorithm, the R-LWE algorithm reduced communication and storage costs by 3 °C each, and compared to elliptic curve cryptography, it reduced them by 4 °C each. This achievement not only enhances the efficiency of encryption and decryption but also lowers the overall operational costs of the algorithm. The research has made significant strides in improving the security and efficiency of IoT device identity authentication by enhancing the R-LWE algorithm.

To achieve this goal, the proposed method combines two-way chaotic maps and reversible cellular automata (RCA). First, this approach uses a two-way chaotic model named spatiotemporal chaos for image confusion. This step includes permuting the image pixels using a chaotic map at the byte level. Then, the RCA model is utilized for image diffusion. In this step, the RCA model iterates over image pixels to modify them at the bit level.

The traditional techniques could not be applied to tackle those problems because the computational cost required by them increases exponentially with increasing the dimensions of the optimization problems. Therefore, over the last few years, researchers have paid attention to the metaheuristic algorithms for tackling those problems in an acceptable time. But unfortunately, those algorithms still suffer from not being able to avert local minima, a lack of population diversity, and low convergence speed. As a result, this paper presents a new binary optimization technique based on integrating the equilibrium optimizer (EO) with a new local search operator, which effectively integrates the single crossover, uniform crossover, mutation operator, flipping operator, and swapping operator to improve its exploration and exploitation operators. In a more general sense, this local search operator is based on two folds: the first fold borrows the single-point crossover and uniform crossover to accelerate the convergence speed, in addition to avoiding falling into local minima using the mutation strategy; the second fold is based on applying two different mutation operators on the best-so-far solution in the hope of finding a better solution: the first operator is the flip mutation operator to flip a bit selected randomly from the given solution, and the second operator is the swap mutation operator to swap two unique positions selected randomly from the given solution. This variant is called a binary hybrid equilibrium optimizer (BHEO) and is applied to three common binary optimization problems: 0–1 knapsack, feature selection, and the Merkle–Hellman knapsack cryptosystem (MHKC) to investigate its effectiveness. The experimental findings of BHEO are compared with those of the classical algorithm and six other well-established evolutionary and swarm-based optimization algorithms. From those findings, it is concluded that BHEO is a strong alternative to tackle binary optimization problems. Quantatively, BHEO could reach an average fitness of 0.090737884 for the feature section problem and an average difference from the optimal profits for some used Knapsack problems of 2.482. © The Author(s) 2024."

Although the manipulation of OAM based on metasurfaces has brought about great achievements in various fields, such manipulation currently remains at single-DoF level, which means the multiplexed manipulation of OAM with other optical DoFs is still lacking, greatly hampering the application of OAM beams and advancement of metasurfaces. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose the idea of multiplexed coherent pixel (MCP) for metasurfaces. This approach enables the manipulation of arbitrary complex-amplitude under incident lights of both plane and OAM waves, on the basis of which we have realized the multiplexed DoF control of OAM and wavelength. As a result, the MCP method expands the types of incident lights which can be simultaneously responded by metasurfaces, enriches the information processing capability of metasurfaces, and creates applications of information encryption and OAM demultiplexer. Our findings not only provide means for the design of high-security and high-capacity metasurfaces, but also raise the control and application level of OAM, offering great potential for multifunctional nanophotonic devices in the future. © The Author(s) 2024."

Since threshold ring signature was introduced, it was a hard problem whether one can have efficient constructions for it. In this paper, we introduce a new generic construction of threshold ring signature, named GTRS, based on canonical identification of a specific form. Our signature consists of a polynomial (represented by n-t+1 coefficients) and a single response, resulting in significantly shorter threshold ring signatures.

This paper introduces a novel cryptosystem, Public Key Cryptosystem based on Systematic Polar Encoding (PKC-SPE), based on the combination of systematic polar encoding and public-key cryptographic principles. The Systematic Polar Encoding (SPE), derived from the well-established field of polar codes, serves as the foundation for this proposed cryptographic scheme. Here, we have used MATLAB Software to introduce and implement the PKC-SPE Cryptosystem. The paper examines key generation, encryption, and decryption algorithms, providing insights into the adaptability and efficiency of systematic polar encoding in public-key cryptography. We assess the efficiency of the PKC-SPE Cryptosystem in three aspects: key size, computational complexity, and system implementation timings. In addition, we compare the PKC-SPE Cryptosystem with PKC-PC cryptosystem and find that it has reduced key sizes (Pr = 0.8436 kbytes). The results obtained through simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed cryptosystem and highlighting its potential for integration into real-world communication systems. Thus, in the paradigm shift to quantum computing, the PKC-SPE cryptosystem emerges as a promising candidate to secure digital communication in the quantum computing era. © The Author(s) 2024."

By decentralizing computing and storage resources to the network edge, MEC significantly enhances real-time data access services and enables efficient processing of large-scale dynamic data on resource-limited devices. However, MEC faces considerable security challenges, particularly in cross-domain service environments, where every device poses a potential security threat. To address this issue, this paper proposes a secure cross-domain authentication scheme based on a threshold signature tailored to MEC’s multi-subdomain nature. The proposed scheme employs a (t,n) threshold mechanism to bolster system resilience and security, catering to large-scale, dynamic, and decentralized MEC scenarios. Additionally, the proposed scheme features an efficient authorization update function that facilitates the revocation of malicious nodes. Security analysis confirmed that the proposed scheme satisfies unforgeability, collusion resistance, non-repudiation and forward security. Theoretical evaluation and experimental simulation verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed scheme. Compared with existing schemes, the proposed scheme has higher computational performance while implementing secure authorization updates. © The Author(s) 2024."

Cryptography based on QCA design methodologies is a novel concept in digital circuit design. Data security in nano-communication is crucial in data transmission and reception; hence, cryptographic approaches are necessary. The data entering the input line is encrypted by an encoder, and then sent to the designated output line, where it is decoded and transferred. The Nanorouter is offered as a data path selector, and the proposed study analyses the cell count of QCA and the circuit delay. In this manuscript, novel designs of (4:1)) Mux and (1:4) Demux designs are utilized to implement the proposed nanorouter design.

Liquid crystal (LC) is usually employed as an additional index-changing layer together with metasurfaces. Unfortunately, most of the reported LCs only impart a varying but uniform phase on top of that from the metasurface, which we term “scalar” LC optics. Here, we pixelate a single-layer LC to display versatile and tunable vectorial holography, in which the polarization and amplitude could be arbitrarily and independently controlled at varying spatial positions.

However, the storage of sensitive data on remote servers poses privacy risks and is presently a source of concern. Searchable Encryption (SE) is an effective method for protecting sensitive data while preserving server-side searchability. Hierarchical Public key Encryption with Keyword Search (HPEKS), a new variant of SE, allows users with higher access permission to search over encrypted data sent to lower-level users. To the best of our knowledge, there exist only four HPEKS schemes in the literature. Two of them are in traditional public-key setting, and the remaining ones are identity-based public key cryptosystems. Unfortunately, all of the four existing HPEKS schemes are vulnerable against inside Keyword Guessing Attacks (KGAs). Moreover, all of the existing HPEKS schemes are based on the computationally expensive bilinear pairing operation which dramatically increases the computational costs. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we introduce the notion of Hierarchical Identity-Based Authenticated Encryption with Keyword Search (HIBAEKS). We formulate a security model for HIBAEKS and propose an efficient pairing-free HIBAEKS scheme. We then prove that the proposed HIBAEKS scheme is secure under the defined security model and is resistant against KGAs. Finally, we compare our proposed scheme with related constructions regarding security requirements, computational and communication costs to indicate the overall superiority of our proposed scheme. © The Author(s) 2024."

Up to now, many card-based ZKP protocols for pen-and-pencil puzzles, like Sudoku, have been designed. Those games, mostly edited by Nikoli, have simple rules, yet designing them in card-based ZKP protocols is non-trivial. In this work, we propose a card-based ZKP protocol for Usowan, a Nikoli game. In Usowan, for each room of a puzzle instance, there is exactly one piece of false information. The goal of the game is to detect this wrong data amongst the correct data and also to satisfy the other rules. Designing a card-based ZKP protocol to deal with the property of detecting a liar has never been done. In some sense, we propose a physical ZKP for hiding of a liar. This work extends a previous paper appearing in Ref. [1]. In this extension, we propose two other protocols, for Herugolf and Five Cells. The puzzles are specifically chosen because each of those three puzzles shares a common constraint, connectivity. However, showing the connected configuration cannot be done with generic approach and brings new construction to the existing connectivity ZKP protocol. Indeed, in Herugolf, the connectivity is handled with a given length of cell which is decremental (i.e., the length of each connected cell decreases by one at each step). For Five Cells, there is an additional step in the setup allowing to encode all the information needed to ensure a valid ZKP protocol. © 1996-2012 Tsinghua University Press."

IoMT incorporates Internet of Things in medical systems. However, IoMT devices are often built with no security in mind, which make them susceptible to various attacks, such as data theft, manipulation, and denial of service. Therefore, security and privacy are essential for the wider adoption and trust of IoMT. In this paper, a video tracking-based CryptoStegno model is proposed to secure private and medical records in an IoMT environment. Private information protection is made possible through crypto-steganography. An added layer of protection is guaranteed through video tracking technology, where data is embedded at multiple tracked objects. In addition, video steganography handles the issue of embedding capacity via utilizing multiple frames. Thus, this paper proposes a novel CryptoStegno model for embedding medical and private data based on video Steganography. Also, AES cryptography is used to encrypt the data before the embedding process to provide a high level of security. Hence, the proposed approach provides robustness and security to the data. On a variety of video sequences, the proposed scheme is examined using different metrics to ensure the robustness of the model such as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Square Error (MSE), Structural Similarity (SSIM) Index, and Bit Error Rate (BER). In terms of PSNR, an improvement of around 2% of was achieved compared to the state of the art, while 5% and 9% improvements were achieved in terms of SSIM and RMSE, respectively. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

As the recommended lattice signature scheme, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, when implemented on hardware, has seen limited research on side-channel analysis, and current attacks are incomplete or requires a substantial quantity of traces. Therefore, we conducted a more complete analysis to investigate the leakage of an FPGA implementation of CRYSTALS-Dilithium using the Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) method, where with a minimum of 70,000 traces partial private key coefficients can be recovered. Furthermore, we optimise the attack by extracting Point-of-Interests using known information due to parallelism (named CPA-PoI) and by iteratively utilising parallel leakages (named CPA-ITR). Our experimental results show that CPA-PoI reduces the number of traces by up to 16.67%, CPA-ITR by up to 25%, and both increase the number of recovered key coefficients by up to 55.17% and 93.10% using the same number of traces. They outperfom the CPA method. As a result, it suggests that the FPGA implementation of CRYSTALS-Dilithium is more vulnerable than thought before to side-channel analysis. © The Author(s) 2024."

Security of the MPPK key encapsulation mechanism does not rely on the prime factorization or discrete logarithm problems. It builds upon the NP-completeness of the modular Diophantine equation problem, for which there are no known efficient classical or quantum algorithms. Hence, it is resistant to known quantum computing attacks. The private key of MPPK comprises a pair of multivariate polynomials. In a companion paper, we analyzed the performance of MPPK when these polynomials are quadratic. The analysis highlighted the MPPK high decapsulation time.

Employing the ultrathin metasurfaces in optical encryption has promoted the miniaturization and multifunctionality of encryption systems. Nevertheless, with the few number of degrees of freedom (DoFs) multiplexed by single metasurface, both key space and encoding space are limited. To address this issue, we propose a high-security and large-capacity optical encryption scheme based on perfect high-dimensional Poincaré beams with expanded DoFs. By cascading two arrayed metasurfaces, more beam properties can be independently engineered, which gives rise to the extensively expanded key and encoding spaces.

In the field of quantum cryptography (especially quantum key distribution, QKD), the so-called secret key rate is used for characterizing the performance of a protocol (scheme). However the current definition of this quantity is incomplete. It does not consider the classical communication process taking place in a QKD protocol. There exists a quantity that involves all the procedures (resources) in a communication process: it is the efficiency (total efficiency). This paper reports a definition of this parameter. Also the relation between the total efficiency and key rate is found. By means of this relation, the total secret key rate of a QKD protocol is expressed. An application of the total key rate is demonstrated: the original twin-field QKD (TF-QKD) is evaluated in terms of this rate.

The earliest attempt to achieve homomorphic evaluation of SHA-256 hash function was proposed by Mella and Susella (in: Cryptography and coding—14th IMA international conference, IMACC 2013. Lecture notes in computer science, vol 8308. Springer, Heidelberg, pp 28–44, 2013. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-45239-0_3.) based on the BGV scheme. Unfortunately, their implementation faced significant limitations due to the exceedingly high multiplicative depth, rendering it impractical. Recently, a homomorphic implementation of SHA-256 based on the TFHE scheme (Homomorphic evaluation of SHA-256. https://github.com/zama-ai/tfhe-rs/tree/main/tfhe/examples/sha256_bool) brings it from theory to reality, however, its current efficiency remains insufficient. In this paper, we revisit the homomorphic evaluation of the SHA-256 hash function in the context of TFHE, further reducing the reliance on gate bootstrapping and enhancing evaluation latency. Specifically, we primarily utilize ternary gates to reduce the number of gate bootstrappings required for logic functions in message expansion and addition of modulo 232 in iterative compression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our optimization techniques are applicable to the Chinese commercial cryptographic hash SM3. Finally, we give specific comparative implementations based on the TFHE-rs library. Experiments demonstrate that our optimization techniques lead to an improvement of approximately 35–50% compared with the state-of-the-art result under different cores. © The Author(s) 2024."

The use of on-demand quantum light sources in QKD protocols is expected to help improve security and maximum tolerable loss. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a promising building block for quantum communication applications because of the deterministic emission of single photons with high brightness and low multiphoton contribution. Here we report on the first intercity QKD experiment using a bright deterministic single photon source. A BB84 protocol based on polarisation encoding is realised using the high-rate single photons in the telecommunication C-band emitted from a semiconductor QD embedded in a circular Bragg grating structure. Utilising the 79 km long link with 25.49 dB loss (equivalent to 130 km for the direct-connected optical fibre) between the German cities of Hannover and Braunschweig, a record-high secret key bits per pulse of 4.8 × 10−5 with an average quantum bit error ratio of ~ 0.65% are demonstrated. An asymptotic maximum tolerable loss of 28.11 dB is found, corresponding to a length of 144 km of standard telecommunication fibre. Deterministic semiconductor sources therefore challenge state-of-the-art QKD protocols and have the potential to excel in measurement device independent protocols and quantum repeater applications. © The Author(s) 2024."

However, ensuring the security of EHR cloud system remains a critical issue. Some patients require regular remote medical services, and controlling access to medical data involving patient privacy during specific times is essential. Timed-release encryption (TRE) technology enables the sender to preset a future time T at which the data can be decrypted and accessed. It is a cryptographic primitive with time-dependent properties. Currently, mainstream TRE schemes are based on non-interactive single time server methods. However, if the single time server is attacked or corrupted, it is easy to directly threaten the security applications of TRE. Although some research schemes “distribute” the single time server into multiple ones, they still cannot resist the single point of failure problem. To address this issue, we propose a multiple time servers TRE scheme based on Shamir secret sharing and another variant derived from it. In our proposed schemes, the data receiver does not need to interact with the time servers; instead, they only need to obtain the time trapdoors that exceed or equal the preset threshold value for decryption, which ensures the identity privacy of the data sender and tolerates partial downtime or other failures of some time servers, significantly improving TRE reliability. Security analysis indicates that our proposed schemes demonstrate data confidentiality, verifiability, anti-advance decryption, and robust decryption with multiple time trapdoors, making them more practical. Efficiency analysis indicates that although our schemes have slightly higher computational costs than most efficient existing TRE schemes, such differences are insignificant from a practical application perspective. © The Author(s) 2024."

Attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme is considered a powerful encryption technique that offers flexible and fine-grained access control capabilities. Further, the multi-user collaborative access ABE scheme additionally supports users to acquire access authorization through collaborative works. However, the existing multi-user collaborative access ABE schemes do not consider the different weights of collaboration users. Therefore, using these schemes for weighted multi-user collaborative access results in either redundant attributes or unsuccessful construction of the access control structure. For this, we proposes the special attribute policy (SAP) problem about weighted multi-user collaborative access, and presents an efficient ciphertext-policy weighted attribute-based encryption with collaborative access scheme (CP-WABE-CA), which can provide efficient collaborative access control for multiple users with different weights. In detail, this scheme utilizes a novel weighted access tree to prevent attribute repetition, thereby eliminating redundant attributes and addressing the issue of constructing access control structures. We prove our scheme is resistant against chosen plaintext attack. The experimental results demonstrate that our scheme has significant computational efficiency advantages compared to related works, without increasing storage or communication overhead. Therefore, the CP-WABE-CA scheme can provide an efficient flexible weighted collaborative access control mechanisms for cloud storage. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

However, due to the high openness of satellite-to-ground links in STIN, users are vulnerable to attacks such as eavesdropping, replay, tampering, and impersonation when requesting access to satellite nodes and obtaining subscription services. To ensure the security and reliability, many authentication protocols have been proposed, but there are still some shortcomings, such as high authentication overhead, vulnerability to certain attacks. In addition, for inter-satellite handovers caused by the highly dynamic topology of satellites, the computational overhead of existing handover authentication mechanisms is too high to be applied to frequent inter-satellite handover scenarios in STIN. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a new access and handover authentication protocol with batch verification for STIN, namely the AHA-BV protocol. The AHA-BV protocol not only realizes mutual authentication and key negotiation between users and satellite access points without the participation of the network control center, but also ensures the conditional anonymity of users during the access authentication phase. Furthermore, the lightweight batch verification mechanism reduces the risk of computing bottlenecks when resource-constrained satellites receive a large number of access authentication requests. Not only that, the AHA-BV protocol can also achieve sustained trust in subscription services from STIN with low computational overhead during the inter-satellite handover authentication phase. Formal and heuristic security analysis show that the AHA-BV protocol can meet the security requirements of STIN. Performance analysis indicates that the AHA-BV protocol has low authentication overhead while ensuring security, and is more suitable for users under satellite dynamic topology to access and obtain subscription services from STIN. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Unfortunately, CL signatures suffer from linear size drawbacks. The signature size grows linearly based on the signing messages, which decreases the interest in practice, as each user may have multiple attributes (messages). Its standard EUF-CMA security was first proven under an interactive assumption. While the interactive assumption is not desirable in cryptography, Fuchsbauer et al. revisited its security at CRYPTO’18 by proving the scheme under the discrete logarithm (Dlog) assumption in the algebraic group model (AGM) that idealizes the adversary's computation to be algebraic, yet the reduction loss is non-tight. In this work, we propose a new variant of CL signatures, namely CL+ signatures, that improves efficiency and security. The proposed CL+ signatures possess randomizability without the linear size drawback, such that signature size is a constant of three group elements. Besides, we prove the security of CL+ signatures can be tightly reduced to the DLog problem in AGM with only a loss factor of 3. Lastly, we show how CL+ signatures can also be instantiated to anonymous credential systems. © 2024 The Authors"

This protocol is then mapped to a secure access protocol, where only by working together can the parties gain access to some high security asset.

Herein, a dual-mode colorimetric and ratiometric fluorescent sensor based on cellulose for detecting amines has been constructed by a new strategy. This sensor is made of a “negative response” indicator (Lum-MDI-CA) and a “positive response” indicator (perylene tetracarboxylic acid, PTCA). Lum-MDI-CA was obtained by attaching luminol onto cellulose chains, which emitted blue fluorescence and was quenched upon contact with amines. A possible mechanism of fluorescence quenching phenomenon is proposed by the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) of Lum-MDI-CA. Subsequently, by simply mixing Lum-MDI-CA with PTCA, a dual-mode fluorescence sensor was designed for visual detection and classification of amines. When adding ammonia (NH3), morpholine (MOR), benzylamine (BNZ), diethylamine (DEA), and triethylamine (TEA), respectively, the dual-mode sensor showed visible different color changes under both UV light and daylight. In addition, owing to the excellent processibility and formability of cellulose acetate backbone, the prepared sensor can be easily processed into different material forms, including inks, coatings, films, and fibers, which still exhibit excellent fluorescence emission. Such sensors based on cellulose fluorescent materials are of great value in anti-counterfeiting and information encryption. © 2024"

Deep learning (DL) based approaches have rapidly grown to achieve impressive performance in recent years. However, the majority of solutions thus far have been confined to a single network to model the inverse scattering process, resulting in relatively poor recovery performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel objective function to embed implicit cyclic adversarial loss and propose a symmetric forward-inverse reinforcement framework congruent with this objective function for enhancing image recovery performance through scattering media, where two networks are designed to model inverse and forward scattering processes, respectively. A symmetric training strategy, aligned with the formulated objective function, is utilized to fully exploit the feature extraction ability and fine-tune the parameters of the networks, achieving higher-fidelity image recovery than that by a single neural network. Both simulation and experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework. Moreover, this framework also shows convincing robustness to varying noise levels, dataset volumes, and network parameters, indicating proficient restoration of targets from noisy speckles and maintaining comparable performance even with limited training data and fewer network parameters. Furthermore, the promising recovery results on real-world hazy datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework could open up new opportunities to enhance image restoration and recognition performance in biomedical imaging, optical encryption, and holographic display. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, existing chaos systems and image encryption algorithms still have significant room for improvement. To enhance the performance of chaos, we propose an improved chaos system, which experimental tests have shown to have better Lyapunov exponents, bifurcation diagrams, and other dynamic characteristics, passing NIST tests, and good correlation properties. To enhance the image encryption algorithm, we propose a novel image encryption algorithm based on our introduced chaotic system that is not only more secure but also more efficient. Firstly, we randomly select the least significant bit(LSB) of a pixel in the plaintext image for modification and extract the hashed value of the modified plaintext image as the parameter value and initial value of our proposed hyper-chaotic system, aiming to better resist plaintext attacks. Next, we enhance the confusion of pixels within the encrypted image by employing bit-plane shifts and using a novel crossover-boxes for pixel swapping. Lastly, we achieve higher security and improved efficiency by combining forward diffusion and backward diffusion(FDBD) with the addition of perturbation factors. Compared with peer algorithms, our proposed algorithm has advantages in encryption efficiency, local Shannon entropy, the correlation of adjacent pixels, as well as the measurement of sensitivity including the number of pixels change rate (NPCR) and unified averaged changed intensity (UACI). Furthermore, our proposed algorithm achieves a higher mean Shannon entropy (7.994), a lower mean Chi-square value (251.6247), and can achieve more ideal NPCR and UACI with a single encryption round. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

In this area, schemes based on local random generators are used for high-rate key generation. One of these schemes is random phase injection, where channel probe signals with random phases are exchanged between communication parties (source and destination). This paper proposes an SKG scheme in the presence of an untrusted relay, which helps the SKG process while cannot extract the secret key. To make the scheme operational, for the first time, the channel probe signals are considered discrete random phase based on M-PSK signals and a multi-bit quantizer is used in the reception. In addition, to reduce the key error rate, quantization with guard bands (GB) is used for key extraction. For such a scenario, we derive expressions for key agreement rate, key mismatch rate (KMR), key discarding rate (KDR) and key generation rate (KGR). Additionally, for the first time, this work examines the context of geometric secrecy for the proposed discrete phase key generation scheme for both direct and relaying scenarios. Through simulations, several engineering insights are presented to enhance the quality of the proposed SKG and its security. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The proposed metasurface is composed of two layers of nanobricks (NBs), where each layer of NBs independently acts as a polarizer under the light illumination at two selected wavelengths. By tailoring the orientation angles of NBs, distinct continuous grayscale nanoprintings with high fidelity and no crosstalk are encoded into two wavelength-dependent channels.

To solve the reliability issue of nodes in existing TRE anonymous interaction schemes, we propose a blockchain-based TRE protocol for anonymous query time trapdoors. In our protocol, the recipient divides the encrypted trapdoor request information into n ciphertext fragments using secret sharing technology near the decryption time, and employs the idea of onion routing to perform layer-by-layer encryption, creating onion-type data transmitted through middlemen selected from the smart contract. After receiving the ciphertext fragments, the time server integrates them to obtain the trapdoor request information and returns the corresponding time trapdoor to the recipient. This allows the recipient to query any time trapdoor anonymously. Our protocol provides a normative design for the smart contract and specific constraints on the participants’ behavior. Compared with the related anonymous query trapdoor schemes, our protocol improves the probability of successful queries. Security analysis shows that our protocol can resist release-ahead attack, interruption attack, eavesdropping attack, and replacement attack. Performance analysis shows that our protocol outperforms related protocols regarding anonymity, efficiency, and flexibility, achieving highly efficient anonymous interactions. Finally, we conducted an experiment in the Ethereum Rinkeby test network. For the settings of ciphertext fragment number n= 3 and ciphertext fragment threshold t= 2 , the gas consumption for a user to execute the contract was $5.66, which was higher than the contract cost of related schemes, but the contract execution cost was within an acceptable range. © 2023, The Author(s)."

The security of such constructions is based on the intractability of some computational problems. For example, given the group action (G,X,⋆), the weak unpredictability assumption (Alamati et al. (2020) [1]) requires that, given random xi's in X, no probabilistic polynomial time algorithm can compute, on input {(xi,g⋆xi)}i=1,…,Q and y, the set element g⋆y. In this work, we study such assumptions, aided by the definition of group action representations and a new metric, the q-linear dimension, that estimates the “linearity” of a group action, or in other words, how much it is far from being linear. We show that under some hypotheses on the group action representation, and if the q-linear dimension is polynomial in the security parameter, then the weak unpredictability and other related assumptions cannot hold. This technique is applied to some actions from cryptography, like the ones arising from the equivalence of linear codes, as a result, we obtain the impossibility of using such actions for the instantiation of certain primitives. As an additional result, some bounds on the q-linear dimension are given for classical groups, such as Sn, GL(Fn) and the cyclic group Zn acting on itself. © 2024 The Author(s)"

However, the existing LRS schemes may not be competent in some scenarios since they exhibit a gap to bridge as reflected on the security guarantees such as the absence of quantum-resistance, inadequate security notions, and a reliance on the random oracle heuristic.

Traditional encryption and storage solutions cannot meet the needs of modern medical data protection, which has led to an urgent need for new data protection strategies. Research personalized medical data privacy and secure storage protection based on hybrid encryption, in order to improve the security and efficiency of data storage. A hybrid encryption mechanism was proposed, which uses user attributes as keys for data encryption. The results show that the storage consumption of user attribute keys increases with the number of user attributes, but the consumption of hybrid encryption privacy storage technology is much smaller than that of traditional schemes. In the test, when the number of users increased to 30, the processing time first reached 1200 ms. During the increase in data volume, both test data and real data showed a brief decrease in attack frequency, but after the data volume reached 730–780, the attack frequency increased. It is worth noting that the performance of test data is better than that of real data. Personalized medical data privacy and secure storage protection based on hybrid encryption can not only effectively improve data security and reduce the risk of attack, but also greatly outperform traditional solutions in storage consumption and processing time.

In a traditional system, a multitude of energy-related data from substations needs to be migrated to central storage, such as Cloud or edge devices, for knowledge extraction that might impose severe data misuse, data manipulation, or privacy leakage. This motivates to propose anomaly detection system to detect threats and Federated Learning to resolve the issues of data silos and privacy of data. In this article, we present a framework to identify anomalies in industrial data that are gathered from the remote terminal devices deployed at the substations in the smart electric grid system. The anomaly detection system is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and autoencoders that employs Mean Standard Deviation (MSD) and Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) approaches for detecting anomalies. We deploy Federated Learning (FL) to preserve the privacy of the data generated by the substations. FL enables energy providers to train shared AI models cooperatively without disclosing the data to the server. In order to further enhance the security and privacy properties of the proposed framework, we implemented homomorphic encryption based on the Paillier algorithm for preserving data privacy.

A blockchain-based intrusion logging mechanism is presented, which enhances vehicle privacy protection through Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm encryption and uses Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) to store the intrusion logs. The intrusion behavior can be faithfully recorded by logging smart contract after detecting the intrusion, which can be used to track intruders, analyze security vulnerabilities, and collect evidence. Experiments based on different open source datasets show that FL achieves a high detection rates on intrusion data and effectively reduce the communication overhead, the smart contract performs well on evaluation indicators such as sending rate, latency, and throughput. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

However, the security of IoT networks is a significant concern due to the large volume of data generated and transmitted over them. The limited resources of IoT devices, along with their mobility and diverse characteristics, pose significant challenges for maintaining security in routing protocols, such as the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). This lacks effective defense mechanisms against routing attacks, including Sybil and rank attacks. Various techniques have been proposed to address this issue, including cryptography and intrusion-detection systems. The use of these techniques on IoT nodes is limited by their low power and lossy nature, primarily due to the significant computational overhead they involve. In addition, conventional trust-management systems for addressing security concerns need to be improved due to their high computation, memory, and energy costs. Therefore, this paper presents a novel, Lightweight, and Efficient Trust-based Mechanism (LETM-IoT) for resource-limited IoT networks to mitigate Sybil attacks. We conducted extensive simulations in Cooja, the Contiki OS simulator, to assess the efficacy of the proposed LETM-IoT against three types of Sybil attack (A, B, and C). A comparison was also made with standard RPL and state-of-the-art approaches. The experimental findings show that LETM-IoT outperforms both of these in terms of average packet-delivery ratio by 0.20 percentage points, true-positive ratio by 1.34 percentage points, energy consumption by 2.5%, and memory utilization by 19.42%. The obtained results also show that LETM-IoT consumes increased storage by 5.02% compared to the standard RPL due to the existence of an embedded security module. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Regarding the memory level, a suitable combination of dynamic body bias, stacked networks, and multi-Vth techniques has been used in the architecture of asymmetric cell-structure inverters as a latch section to reduce power consumption and improve hardware efficiency. In addition, the logic styles of virtual ground and power gating based on word and BL data lines and a tri-state buffer structure have been used to extend the write VTC and improve read stability, respectively. From the perspective of PUF performance, the body of the latch section can form skewed VTCs based on the setting of critical parameters in GnrFET technology to achieve an efficient PUF circuit design. At the memory performance level, the Monte Carlo (MC) method-based results confirm the reasonable performance of the proposed structure in terms of static noise margin (SNM) and hardware efficiency, such as 53 % delay and 72 % energy-delay product (EDP) parameters, compared with the 6 T SRAM structure in a similar 16 nm GnrFET technology. In addition, in terms of the performance as a PUF circuit, the simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed cell in terms of energy consumption, BER, response time, uniqueness, and stability under non-technological variation conditions of temperature and supply voltage. The outstanding performance results of the figure of merits (FoMs), CEQM, and UR2, which are composed of variability, energy, reliability, and layout-level factors, indicate the suitability of the proposed memory architecture for use in both the memory and PUF modes. Furthermore, to investigate the application level, memory structure has been used to store fingerprint images as PUF data using a hardware algorithm. The results of the proposed comprehensive FoM, which is based on the simultaneous consideration of circuit level and quality parameters, indicate that the proposed memory scheme in a bit-interleaved architecture-compatible design can be introduced as a high-performance candidate for generating and storing unique binary data in PUF-based IoT platforms. © 2024"

While traditional VC has been instrumental in safeguarding data, it often falls short in maintaining image quality and semantic accuracy upon reconstruction. To address these limitations, this research encompasses the development of an Enhanced Semantic VC (ESVC) model, which aims to refine the encryption process while ensuring the semantic integrity of the images. The ESVC model introduces a new approach that merges VC with artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance 2D image encryption and decryption. The novel aspect of this research lies in the integration of AI-driven reinforcement learning (RL) to increase the quality of the 2D image by measuring the errors between the original secret image and the reconstructed image. This innovative framework is tailored for the secure transmission of 2D grayscale images, ensuring the preservation of semantic integrity while measuring and minimizing image quality loss. By integrating RL algorithms with a measurement of error reduction protocol, the model promises robust encryption capabilities with enhanced resilience against a plethora of cyber threats, thereby elevating the standard for secure image communication. Empirical evaluation of the ESVC model yields promising results, with the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of reconstructed images achieving impressive values between +39 and +42 decibels (dB). These findings underscore the ESVC model’s capability to produce high-fidelity decrypted images, significantly surpassing traditional VC methods in both security and image quality.

First, multiple medical images were normalized, and the processed images were fused using a gray-weighted average fusion method for image fusion. Second, an FFST is applied to the fused image to divide the low-frequency sub-bands into blocks of the same size and perform Schur decomposition, which generates a feature image using the magnitude between the largest eigenvalue of each block and the overall average value.

A one-step encryption algorithm is used to encrypt these critical areas based on chaos, where scrambling and diffusion are simultaneously performed. A new chaotic system 2D extended Schaffer function map (2D-ESFM) is utilized in the encryption system, inspired by the Schaffer function. The system has demonstrated excellent performance through Lyapunov exponents (LEs), permutation entropy (PE), the 0-1 test, and other methods. Additionally, to resist chosen plaintext attacks, the secret key is generated by a neural network, with the critical areas of the video as inputs to the neural network.

Existing schemes have various security vulnerabilities and are susceptible to security attacks (e.g., masquerading user, password guessing, internal privilege, and MITT attacks), so they cannot meet the anonymity requirements or achieve forward security. To effectively improve the security performance of WSNs, an elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based three-factor authentication and key agreement scheme for WSNs is proposed. The scheme is based on the ECC protocol and combines biometrics, smart card and password authentication technology; uses a challenge/response mechanism to complete the authentication between users, gateways, and sensors; and negotiates a secure session key. The Burrows, Abadi and Needham logic for formal security analysis proves the correctness and security of the scheme, and the informal analysis of multiple known attacks proves that the scheme can resist various attacks and has high security characteristics. The feasibility of the scheme has been analysed and verified with the ProVerif tool.

However, security and privacy are two of the most essential features of wireless communication. Using a Mutual Authentication and Session Key Agreement (MASK) scheme, an authorized mobile user can login to a remote server over the Internet. In quantum contexts, many of the MASK schemes are not secure. This paper proposes a One-Time Password (OTP) and biometric-based Multi-Factor MASK (OTP-MF-MASK) scheme for mobile users. We used Peikert's authentication and reconciliation mechanism, defined for the post-quantum environments. The OTP-MF-MASK scheme used a password, mobile device, biometric, and OTP as login credentials. To avoid the biometric acquisition problem, we used the fuzzy extractor in the OTP-MF-MASK scheme. We proved that the OTP-MF-MASK scheme is semantically secure in the Random Oracle Model (ROM) based on the hardness assumption of the Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE) problem.

All ECC-based cryptosystems heavily rely on point multiplication operation where its efficient realization has attained notable focus in the research community. Low latency implementation of the point multiplication operation is frequently required in high-speed applications such as online authentication and web server certification. This paper presents a low latency ECC point multiplication architecture for Montgomery curves over generic prime filed GF(p). The proposed architecture is able to operate for a general prime modulus without any constraints on its structure. It is based on a new novel pipelined modular multiplier developed using the Montgomery multiplication and the Karatsuba-Offman technique with a four-part splitting methodology. The Montgomery ladder approach is adopted on a system level, where a high-speed scheduling strategy to efficiently execute GF(p) operations is also presented. Due to these circuit and system-level optimizations, the proposed design delivers low-latency results without a significant increase in resource consumption. The proposed architecture is described in Verilog-HDL for 256-bit key lengths and implemented on Virtex-7 and Virtex-6 FPGA platforms using Xilinx ISE Design Suite. On the Virtex-7 FPGA platform, it performs a 256-bit point multiplication operation in just 110.9 us with a throughput of almost 9017 operations per second. The implementation results demonstrate that despite its generic nature, it produces low latency as compared to the state-of-the-art. Therefore, it has prominent prospects to be used in high-speed authentication and certification applications. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

To ensure the cybersecurity of visual data in construction, this research proposes a deep learning-based image steganography method, which can cover the secret image with an irrelevant image by using a hidden neural network and retrieve the secret image with a reveal neural network. In experiments, a dataset containing 7,000 construction images was used for validating the feasibility of the proposed method.

Sodium alginate, a biomass polysaccharide, has gained widespread attentions recently for the fiber manufacture. However, the limited mechanical strength of alginate fibers restricts their usages as load-bearing fabrics and reinforcement fibers. Here, we develop a novel strategy to prepare alginate multifilaments using pre-crosslinked sodium alginate solutions. The increase in the pre-crosslinking ratio effectively hinders the disentanglement of sodium alginate chains at high stretches, causing an increase in the shear viscosity of the solution ascertained from the capillarity-driven thinning process from 4.5 Pa·s to 9.9 Pa·s and facilitating the high alignment and orientation of sodium alginate chains. The resultant fibers possess a breaking strength of 474 MPa, elongation at break of 16 %, Young's modulus of 14.4 GPa, and toughness of 51.8 MJ/m3, exceeding most biomass fibers without reinforcement additives. The high orientation degree of 0.865 and high spinnability of alginate multifilaments enable their applications in multi-channel encryption fabrics that exhibit distinct information under various optical conditions. This rheological regulation of spinning solutions provides a facile yet effective strategy to enhance the mechanical performance and broaden application scenarios of alginate fibers. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The proposed cryptosystem exploits a set of four fused LL sub-bands from four RGB images, which are converted into a CMYK image and split into C, M, Y, and K channels. The GSVD operation is used to produce five matrices from C and M channels, and five matrices from Y and K channels independently. A single-channel image of the first set formed by fusion of the two unitary matrices from each pair is gyrator transformed. In a similar fashion, the transformed images of a number of sets are combined into a complex image, which is then inverse gyrator transformed. The proposed system exploits optical interference of one phase-only mask (POM) as DVFL and two analytically produced POMs. The parameters of DVFL are used as remarkably sensitive decryption keys. Moreover, the individual keys and two POMs are used as decryption keys to advance the security against potential attacks. To avoid the strict alignment of the three POMs in different arms during the experiment, the summation of the three POMs is displayed on a single spatial light modulator (SLM). Further, gyrator transform does not require axial movements. Therefore, the proposed method avoids problems that result from misalignment.

However, several existing schemes have some security limitations regarding VANET requirements. In many symmetric cryptography-based schemes, the participants are required to share the same keys which could compromise the security of the network in case the key of one participant is compromised, while many asymmetric cryptography-based schemes take much time during the authentication process, and don't address the denial-of-service attack. In this paper, we propose a certificateless scheme that does not require a certificate and prevents the escrow problem. Plus, it uses the elliptic curve cryptography and avoids bilinear pairing and Map-to-Hash functions. We call our scheme Hybrid Cryptography-Based Scheme with a Conditional Privacy-Preserving Authentication (HCBS-CPPA), as it uses both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography during the authentication process. Our scheme combines the strength of an asymmetric encryption that satisfies non-repudiation, and the strength of a symmetric encryption that allows to perform a lightweight authentication. In addition, we show that our scheme is resilient to memory-based Denial of Service (DOS) attack which occurs when an attacker floods the memory of a receiver with invalid messages. A security proof shows that HCBS-CPPA is secure in the random oracle. Regarding the simulation of our scheme, it turns out that HCBS-CPPA has the best performance when compared with several existing certificateless schemes. Additionally, it requires less execution time during the signing and verification process, as well as less communication overhead when compared to the existing schemes. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Current data delegation solutions for Web3.0 predominantly rely on attribute-based encryption algorithms (ABE) but lack the essential capabilities for processing ciphertext. Additionally, the attribute-based ciphertext transformation algorithm (ABCT) falls short when it comes to verifying the transformed ciphertext provided by data proxies. The primary objective of this article is to design a fine-grained and supervised attribute-based data delegating solution tailored specifically for Web3.0. This scheme aims to enhance the ciphertext processing capabilities of existing data delegation solutions based on blockchain and ABE. Additionally, it addresses the current limitations of ABCT technology. This includes its inability to verify re-encrypted ciphertext and ensure non-repudiation of transformation results. We leverage smart contracts to ensure the automatic execution of the data delegation process and to store permanent records on the blockchain for auditing and traceability. This approach guarantees a fair distribution of interests among all stakeholders. Furthermore, we employ a commitment mechanism and digital signature to enhance the regulatory compliance of existing ABCT technology.

Without the need to acquire system-related prior information or perform operations such as adding watermarks or encryption to the data, a detection and identification joint algorithm is proposed using input design. This algorithm can detect potential data tampering attacks in the system while achieving consistent identification of system parameters. Subsequently, a pair of metrics for evaluating the detection performance of the algorithm, namely the missing detection rate and false detection rate, are introduced, and approximate expressions for both are provided, followed by a discussion on the impact of data length and detection threshold on these metrics.

Balanced homodyne detector (BHD) is one of the most promising options for practical quantum state measurement, providing substantial advantages of cost-effectiveness, no cooling requirement, and system compactness. However, due to the stringent requirements in BHD design, it typically suffers from a relatively small operating bandwidth which limits the overall speed of a quantum system. In this study, we propose comprehensive modelling for the BHD in quantum applications and enhance the performance of BHDs based on our modelling. Specifically, we utilise a photonic chip approach and optimise the electronic design to create the integrated BHD, which significantly boosts the 3 dB bandwidth to 4.75 GHz and achieves a shot-noise-limited bandwidth of 23 GHz. We demonstrate the capability of this setup to generate quantum random numbers at a rate of 240 Gbit s−1, highlighting its potential for ultra-high-speed quantum communication and quantum cryptography applications. © 2024 The Author(s).

However, the transmission of sensitive patient data over inherently insecure Internet channels exposes it to a spectrum of security risks. Protecting patient medical privacy and ensuring system reliability necessitate mutual authentication between both patients and medical servers. TMIS relies on robust authentication mechanisms, and combining passwords and smart cards has been a recognised approach for mutual authentication. This research introduces an innovative three-factor authentication technique with perfect forward secrecy by leveraging the power of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) in tandem with smart cards. Additionally, we have incorporated biometric authentication with a Fuzzy Extractor technology to enhance the security and reliability of the system, setting a new standard for user authentication within the realm of Social IoT healthcare. The use of ECC in the method is justified due to its compact key size and robust security measures, making the solution both efficient and secure. The proposed method safeguards user privacy by permitting registered users to change their passwords without divulging their identity to the server. The Burrows–Abadi–Needham logic (also known as the BAN logic) serves as a proof-of-concept for the proposed scheme’s security. Our system provides privacy protection along with mutual authentication and session key negotiation at a considerably low computation cost and communication cost of up to 71.03% compared to the other four relevant techniques, making it more useful in real-world scenarios. © 2023, The Author(s)."

It combines a Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) model with an intertwining logistic map to generate secret keys. Additionally, initial conditions, control parameters, and secret keys are employed by the intertwining logistic map to produce diverse chaotic sequences. Permutation, DNA encoding, diffusion, and bit reversion operations are applied for scrambling and manipulating image pixels. The proposed encryption model was thoroughly examined using various analysis methods such as cropping attack, histogram analysis, key space evaluation, noise attack, information entropy assessment, differential attack, key sensitivity, and correlation coefficient examination. To expand the keyspace and enhance confusion and diffusion in the proposed encryption algorithm, the model employs different subkeys, private keys, and public keys through the Convolutional Neural Network. Furthermore, numerical and perceptual results were compared with the state-of-the-art outcomes to validate the model. Ultimately, the derived results demonstrate that the proposed intertwining logistic map-based image encryption model utilizing Convolutional Neural Network outperforms existing methods.

In 2005, Carlet and Mesnager studied the Walsh supports of Boolean functions and constructed a class of n-variable Boolean functions whose Walsh support is F2n∖{0}, for n≥10. For n≤6, it can be verified using the computer that there is no Boolean function with the Walsh Support F2n∖{0}. However, concerning the values of n=7,8,9, it has been an open problem for many years.

The encryption scheme includes two steps, first, the binary sequence is disturbed by DNA and RNA two-stage encoding and RNA mutation, and then the initial encrypted data is injected into the algorithm module with two-dimensional continuous chaotic mapping (2D-SCL) and Brownian motion to scramble successively. Simulations in a 16QAM CO-OFDM system at a symbol rate of 30 Gbaud over 80 km of standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) show that a legitimate user is able to successfully decrypt the received signals, and an illegal eavesdropper obtains a useless signal with a bit error rate (BER) of about 0.5. The scheme can tolerate very small deviations and has a key space of approximately 10294, which can effectively withstand illegal attacks.

To bolster diverse applications and realize digital transformation, it is imperative to share the generated device data among multiple stakeholders involved in the digital twin system product life cycle. Since the device data contains sensitive and secret information, strict access control is required. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is commonly employed for the construction of a cryptographic-enforced data access control scheme. ABE enables data confidentiality and one-to-many fine-grained access control due to its flexibility and high scalability. Unfortunately, traditional ABE schemes adopted in digital twin system has been hindered by the single point of failure and trust problems. Blockchain is a secure distributed ledger technology with decentralization and tamper-proofing properties. In this article, we present a blockchain-empowered data access control scheme for digital twin system with attribute-based encryption. Firstly, blockchain is employed to construct a complete, tamper-resistant, and efficient architecture for digital twin system to address challenges of access control. Subsequently, to ensure the confidentiality of digital twin data, we employ ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE) to achieve fine-grained and one-to-many access control. Finally, we combine blockchain-based architecture with the interplanetary file system (IPFS) to propose a data storage scheme to release storage pressure on the blockchain and improve system efficiency.

However, the complicated and massive structure of IoT systems poses various security risks and challenges, especially in dynamic scenarios with high signaling overhead caused by subscriber mobility. So, in this paper, a Fuzzy-based Lightweight Authentication and Management of Encryption approach called ‘FLAME’ is proposed to solve the decentralized lightweight group key management problem by measuring the degree of security using fuzzy logic (FL) based on various factors like device and user behavior, network conditions, and resource availability. For effective key-based authentication, adopted an Artificial Lizard Search Optimization (ALSO) based RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman) algorithm that generates private and public keys based on security evaluation outcome. The publishers and subscribers obtain encryption keys from the group key manager based on their security level, and dissemination is optimized by the ALSO algorithm. By leveraging the FL and ALSO based RSA algorithm, the system offers secure communication with limited utilization and protects confidential data in IoT environments.

Experimental results, including X-ray diffraction, optical spectroscopy measurements, and cross-polarized microscope characterization, suggested that compounds might undergo reversible crystal-to-crystal transition upon external acid and base stimuli. It also revealed that the position of the heteroatom nitrogen in the pyridine unit significantly affected the intra- and intermolecular interactions, leading to restricted-intermolecular motions (RIMs) that caused the AIE effect. Besides, computational calculations indicated significant changes in molecular geometries and electronic interactions between the initial states and the protonated states.

In this regard, CCTV offers a well-accepted pervasive solution all over the globe. Here, individuals and industries generally face challenges in storing CCTV video footage in their local machines. Besides, an alternative solution of long-time archiving of large-size video footage in the cloud is also challenging due to the associated steep rise in requirements of bandwidth, computing, and storage requirements. To face these challenges, in this paper, we propose a new methodology to utilize OpenStack Swift's object storage to efficiently store and archive media data. Our method leverages expanding the cloud file-sharing capabilities from storing media files to processing and archiving them along with performing encryption. Our proposed approach first segments encodes, and transcodes the videos according to several resolutions for covering diversified remote devices. Then, we store the processed video footage in the storage server of OpenStack Swift. Afterward, we perform necessary media encryption–decryption, compress the files containing the video data, and archive them using an archive server. We perform all these tasks in our proposed architectural model by developing several new middleware services in OpenStack Swift. As a whole, we build a new storage system architecture where we can efficiently as well as securely store and share large video surveillance data, and later we can find and retrieve that data even after a few years.

Existing MDI-QSDC protocol requires the utilization of entanglement sources which hinders the practical application of the protocol. In this paper, we propose a single-photon MDI-QSDC (SP-MDI-QSDC) protocol, which can realize secure communication using single-photon sources, thereby dispensing the entanglement preparation. In this SP-MDI-QSDC, quantum memory is used, and weak coherent pulses are used as the single-photon source. We conducted an analysis model for quantum memory and communication performance together with decoy-state techniques. The simulation results using actual experimental parameters show that our protocol has compelling communication performance, and the maximum secure communication distance can be further prolonged considerably by incorporating the technique of increasing capacity using masking (INCUM). © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

In particular, antiresonant hollow-core fibers are characterized by vacuum-like propagation speed, suppressed dispersion and nonlinear optical effects and, recently, even ultra-low propagation loss. In recent years, the development of a type of antiresonant hollow-core fiber, called Nested Antiresonant Nodeless Fiber (NANF) has seen tremendous improvements, and applications in both classical and quantum communications have been suggested. While encouraging results over meter long distances have been shown, the distribution of polarized entangled photons over inner-city distances through antiresonant hollow-core fibers has not been demonstrated yet. This could be a game changer for the development of quantum networks, which leverage entanglement for the distribution of secret keys, and more in the long term, in a quantum internet scenario. In this work, an experimental investigation of entanglement distribution through a NANF with an overall length of 7.72 km is presented. Remarkably, substantial reduction of latency (about 13 μs) and suppressed chromatic dispersion (about one order of magnitude) of the studied NANF compared to a telecom single-mode fiber (Corning's SMF28) of equal length are measured for different bandwidths of the distributed entangled photons. Moreover, by encoding entanglement in polarization, high fidelity (>95%) distribution of narrow-bandwidth entangled photons is demonstrated. This result paves the way to the exploitation of NANF as a superior transmitting medium for quantum technology applications relying on the distribution of entanglement encoded in polarization over inner-city distances.  © 1995-2012 IEEE."

With distributed data communication due to data barriers, information interaction security and data computation security have become challenges for secure computing. Combining cloud computing with secure multiparty computation can provide a higher level of data protection while maintaining the benefits of cloud computing. In this case, data can be stored in the cloud and computed through SMPC protocols, thus protecting the privacy and security of the data. However, multiple rounds of information interaction are often required, increasing the communication overhead, and the security strength is limited by the hardness assumption. In this paper, we work to achieve an optimal setting of the number of rounds in secure multi-party computation on the cloud to achieve a sublinear communication overhead and improve the security concept. A 2-round SMPC protocol is constructed in the framework of Universally Composable (UC). A 2-round SMPC protocol is constructed that uses multilinear maps based on the Learning from Errors (LWE) assumption. The participant encodes the input and sends it via broadcast to reduce the interaction, homomorphic computational encoding information for secure access to computational data and secure the SMPC protocol through UC security. This paper extends the participants to multiple parties, reduces the communication rounds to 2, the protocol achieves sublinear communication overhead in poly polynomial time, smaller setup size to poly(k), and static security is achieved. © 2024, The Author(s)."

Machine learning and deep learning have become mainstream methods to analyze traffic, and labeled dataset construction is the basis. Android occupies a huge share of the mobile operating system market. Instant Messaging (IM) applications are important tools for people communication. But such applications have complex functions which frequently switched, so it is difficult to obtain function-level labels. The existing function-level public datasets in Android are rare and noisy, leading to research stagnation. Most labeled samples are collected with WLAN devices, which cannot exclude the operating system background traffic. At the same time, other datasets need to obtain root permission or use scripts to simulate user behavior. These collecting methods either destroy the security of the mobile device or ignore the real operation features of users with coarse-grained. Previous work (Chen et al. in Appl Sci 12(22):11731, 2022) proposed a one-stop automated encrypted traffic labeled sample collection, construction, and correlation system, A3C, running at the application-level in Android. This paper analyzes the display characteristics of IM and proposes a function-level low-overhead labeled encrypted traffic datasets construction method for Android, F3L. The supplementary method to A3C monitors UI controls and layouts of the Android system in the foreground. It selects the feature fields of attributes of them for different in-app functions to build an in-app function label matching library for target applications and in-app functions. The deviation of timestamp between function invocation and label identification completion is calibrated to cut traffic samples and map them to corresponding labels. Experiments show that the method can match the correct label within 3 s after the user operation. © 2024, The Author(s)."

However, the use of encryption techniques and constant changes in network protocols make it difficult to extract useful features for traffic classification. Additionally, there may be limited data availability and a lack of diversity within the dataset, which poses further challenges. To address these issues, our research proposes a novel solution that uses an innovative data augmentation technique. This approach leverages the capabilities of LSTM networks to create synthetic data points that closely resemble real traffic data. By doing so, we can significantly enrich the dataset used for training and improve classification efficiency. We conducted thorough experiments to validate our approach and found that combining LSTM-generated data with actual traffic data leads to notable improvements in classification efficiency. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our methodology using academic and commercial datasets. Our classifier, trained on the generated data, showed a performance boost of 6%. Moreover, when classifying with only half of the time, thus utilizing half of the signal, our approach achieved a notable 4% improvement compared to the original classifier. The inclusion of augmented samples within the training set led to a noticeable improvement in both accuracy and F1-score. These findings compellingly demonstrate our data augmentation strategy's practical utility and efficiency in earlier prediction with improved performance for encrypted traffic classification systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

This paper presents a multipurpose medical image system based on a join of security and watermarking to achieve high data protection. We propose a block-splitting technique applied to large-scale cover medical images and hidden watermarks. In each subspace, we calculate Racah moments and apply a new evolutionary algorithm to automatically select the best positions for moments to be used for watermark hiding. This selection is based on a set of chromosomes with a specific coding strategy and evolutionary operators. The entire watermarked medical image is transmitted, and the extraction process is applied on the receiving side to recover the hidden watermark. Our method aims to achieve an optimal trade-off between watermarking requirements (imperceptibility and robustness) and enhance data protection by combining the proposed method with the three security services (confidentiality, integrity, and authentication). This hybrid combination uses high-performance encryption algorithms applied to the watermark components: the patient's fingerprint, Electronic Record Patient, and doctor's face. Watermarking performance and security services are evaluated using different medical datasets (DICOM, Figshare Brain Tumor, Covid-19, CXR, and MuRa images) in the absence of noise and against local or global noise. A comparative analysis with reliable and recent methods in medical image watermarking shows that our method achieves high performance: imperceptibility with a maximum PSNR of 46 dB, robustness with a maximum NC of 0.98, authentication with a maximum PSNR of 36.2 dB, and integrity with a maximum similarity of 0.97. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Among them, ensuring data confidentiality, achieving dual-side privacy protection, and performing reliable data integrity verification are basic requirements. Especially in resource-constrained environments, limitations in the storage, computing, and communication capabilities of devices increase the difficulty of implementing these security safeguards. To address this problem, this paper proposes a resource-constrained anonymous data-sharing scheme (ADS-RC) for the IoT. In ADS-RC, we use elliptic curve operations to replace computation-intensive bilinear pairing operations, thereby reducing the computational and communication burden on end devices. We combine an anonymous verifiable algorithm and an attribute encryption algorithm to ensure double anonymity and data confidentiality during the data-sharing process. To deal with potential dishonest behavior, this solution supports the revocation of malicious user permissions. In addition, we designed a batch data integrity verification algorithm and stored verification evidence on the blockchain to ensure the security and traceability of data during transmission and storage. Through experimental verification, the ADS-RC scheme achieves reasonable efficiency in correctness, security and efficiency, providing a new solution for data sharing in resource-constrained IoT environments. © 2024"

To ensure data privacy, a data owner will generate the ciphertext of the data before outsourcing. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) provides an elegant solution for a data owner to enforce fine-grained access control on the data to be outsourced. However, ABE cannot support ciphertext transformation when needing to share the underlying data with a public-key infrastructure (PKI) user further. In addition, an untrusted cloud server may return random ciphertexts to the PKI user to save expensive computational costs of ciphertext transformation. To address above issues, we introduce a novel cryptographic primitive namely verifiable and hybrid attribute-based proxy re-encryption (VHABPRE). VHABPRE provides a transformation mechanism that re-encrypts an ABE ciphertext to a PKI-based public key encryption (PKE) ciphertext such that the PKI user can access the underlying data, meanwhile this PKI user can ensure the validity of the transformed ciphertext.

These innovative transaction methods have rapidly made their mark in the financial sector, reshaping the dynamics of the global economy. However, there remains a notable hesitation in its widespread acceptance and adoption, largely due to misconceptions and lack of proper guidance about its use. Such gaps in understanding create an opportunity to address these concerns. Using the technology acceptance model (TAM), this study develops a parsimonious model to explain the awareness, acceptance, and adoption of cryptocurrency. The model was assessed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with a sample of 332 participants aged 18 to 40 years. The findings suggest that cryptocurrency awareness plays a direct, positive, and significant role in shaping cryptocurrency adoption and that this positive relationship is mediated by factors that exemplify cryptocurrency acceptance, namely the ease of use and usefulness of cryptocurrency. The results also reveal that trust is a significant factor that strengthens these direct and mediating relationships. These insights emphasize the necessity of fostering an informed understanding of cryptocurrencies to accelerate their broader adoption in the financial ecosystem. By addressing the misconceptions and reinforcing factors like ease of use, usefulness, and trust, policymakers and financial institutions can better position themselves to integrate and promote cryptocurrency in mainstream financial systems. © 2024, The Author(s)."

However, using the entire set of units within this structure would be computationally impractical in practical applications. Thus, we present a novel approach for designing 16×16 and 32×32 substitution boxes over chain and non-chain Galois ring respectively, by utilizing subgroups of local rings in a computationally feasible manner. Our proposed scheme significantly reduces memory usage by integrating both chain and non-chain rings. Specifically, the 16×16 and 32×32 S-boxes require only 16×28and 32×28 memory cells, respectively, whereas S-boxes of these dimensions over fields have been shown to be highly inefficient due to their extensive memory requirements (16×216and 32×232,respectively). The proposed method offers a more efficient solution for constructing S-boxes over large Galois fields and integrates chain and non-chain local Galois rings, as well as finite fields, for efficient transmission designs in smart devices. The algebraic structures used in this approach are used to establish the most vital aspect of a block cipher, the substitution box. We use each of these algebraic structures, each with a different bit size, to construct three distinct S-boxes. We discuss the performance and sensitivity of the proposed S-boxes to demonstrate their effectiveness in data protection. In this technique, the substitution boxes established by the non-chain ring, maximal cyclic subgroup of the Galois ring, and Galois field are applied for the processes of substitution, exclusive-or function, and diffusion in image encryption, respectively. Furthermore, we have performed numerous standard analyses on the encrypted image, including statistical analysis, differential analysis, and NIST tests. The results of these tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for various cryptographic purposes.

To keep safe such images, cryptography is among the best methods and especially when it integrates chaotic systems due to their sensitivity to initial seeds. So, a chaos-based cryptosystem using DNA confusion and diffusion is proposed and applied to biomedical images in this work. It also includes hash functions that compress an indeterminate size of data into fixed size of data. The security and the reliability of the information system are ensured with the combination of two hash functions. The execution time is then considerable, and the integrity of the encrypted image is guaranteed. Encoding/decoding rules and operations are selected using the result of the numerical integration of the logistic map. At the level of diffusion, seven functions are employed reinforcing the security level of our cryptosystem. The construction of the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) key is done through the iteration of the new cyclic chaotic system having initial states derived using the keys obtained from the combination of hash functions and external key, thus building a PRNS (pseudorandom number sequence). The entire dynamics of the new system in both symmetric and asymmetric cases is then performed, exhibiting relevant behaviors such as the coexistence of up to eight attractors, intermittency, parallel branches of bifurcations, and metastable chaos very rare in literature, to name a few. PSpice is used to verify the numerical results. Based on confusion and diffusion, the new encryption/decryption algorithm is effective in both processes. The experimental results show that the cryptosystem is able to withstand brute force, exhaustive, statistical, differential, and robustness attacks. Also, the comparison of the algorithm with good ones from the literature shows that it is among the best proposed up to date. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Física 2024."

This enhancement is achieved by minimizing differences between rows, thereby reducing the computational load on Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) systems. However, many existing reconfiguration methods face various challenges, including scalability issues, inadequate shading dispersion, distortion of array characteristics, emergence of multiple power peaks, increased mismatch, and more. In order to overcome these obstacles, this study presents a novel method for array reconfiguration that is modelled after the widely used Kolakoski Sequence Transform in picture encryption. The suggested approach is assessed in eight different scenarios with 9 × 9 and 5 × 5 PV arrays shaded differently. Its performance is compared against seven established techniques. Due to its intelligent reconfiguration aimed at minimizing shade dispersion, the suggested approach consistently outperforms alternative methods. It results in substantial improvements in GMP, enhancing it by 32.79%, 14.98%, 10.15%, and 4.13% for 9 × 9 arrays, and 37.10%, 14.36%, and 9.88% for 5 × 5 arrays across diverse conditions. Furthermore, this study comprehensively investigates three separate Artificial Neural Network algorithms, specifically the Levenberg-Marquardt (LMB), Scaled Conjugate Gradient, and Bayesian Regularization algorithms for MPPT. A Levenberg-Marquardt Backpropagation-based MPPT controller for a 250Wp standalone PV system is used to validate the effectiveness of the recommended configuration. This integrated approach, which combines reconfiguration and LMB-based MPPT utilizes only two sensors regardless of array size. It achieves accelerated convergence tracking within a short 0.13 s, displaying minimal steady-state oscillations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

It also has an improved PSNR and beats state-of-the-art in various attacks. The model outperforms existing deep learning frameworks in terms of fidelity. All these are achieved by creating a modified and much more efficient form of Inception Resnet block, coined ResCeption Block, for use in effective learning of watermarking networks. The research also presents an application of watermarking in the identification of AI generated images and proposes a novel and robust algorithm for metadata encryption of digital images and enforce digital media security.

Therefore, a fusion domain intelligent blind watermarking scheme using graph-based transform (GBT) is proposed, which is finished in the spatial domain based on the principle of the transform domain. By selecting a special graph structure, the fast conversion mechanism of the stable GBT coefficients in the graph transform matrix is established, which can calculate the stable GBT coefficients directly in the spatial domain. According to the distribution rule of stable GBT coefficients in space, a new mechanism is proposed to prevent the energy loss of stability coefficients. In addition, a simplified Chen chaotic encryption system (SCCES) combined with the Cantor pairing function is used to achieve dual encryption of the watermark image and key parameters of the watermark algorithm. Instead of the traditional manual selection of the embedding strength factor, the optimal embedding strength is obtained by applying the good optimization characteristics of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The simulation results (i.e., the average PSNR above 40 dB, the average SSIM exceeding 0.970, the average NIQE below 5 while maintaining NC above 0.85 and BER below 0.15 under most attacks, the algorithm operates in less than 1 s, and the key space more than 218 × 1024!) demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves better performance compared to the traditional method. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

To meet this need, a technique known as buyer–seller watermarking has emerged. Despite its existence, the majority of existing buyer–seller watermarking schemes adopt the owner-side embedding mode, which results in poor scalability. While a handful of schemes adopt the client-side embedding mode to enhance scalability, they either require the deep involvement of a trusted third party or fall short of ensuring complete fairness due to the unresolved unbinding problem. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a fair and scalable watermarking scheme for digital content transactions based on proxy re-encryption and digital signatures. For one thing, this scheme solves the unbinding problem and ensures complete fair protection of the rights of both buyers and sellers. For another, it adopts the client-side embedding mode and has good scalability. Additionally, it eliminates the need for a trusted third party.

While the initial focus in metasurface research has often been on manipulating electromagnetic waves using single polarization and frequency schemes, significant advancements have been made to overcome these limitations. Recent developments have introduced multifunctional metasurfaces that enable simultaneous control over multiple frequencies and polarizations, substantially enhancing their capacity for information processing and communication. Building on these advancements, our work introduces a novel three-channel full-space metasurface that leverages double-face copper-cladded patterns on a single-layer substrate, significantly increasing channel capacity through both frequency and polarization multiplexing. In order to achieve efficient control of the EM wavefront in multi-frequency and polarization scenarios, a super unit cell-based approach is utilized, wherein high-performance meta-atoms are combined to form super unit cells with minimal interferences. Specifically, different functionalities can be achieved in full space under different wave polarizations and frequencies. To validate the concept, a metasurface sample is fabricated and experimentally tested. The experimental results agree with both theoretical predictions and simulations, confirming the effectiveness of a three-channel metasurface holography.

In this work, the integration of terpyridine-derived photochromic spiropyran (Tpy-SP) as Zn2+ ion chelating agent and photo-regulator building blocks endows the materials with dynamic assembly-induced optical functionality. Under UV light irradiation, the Tpy-Zn2+-SP will be transformed into Tpy-Zn2+-MC, which forms coordinated architecture with distinct optical properties from that of Tpy-MC form. Modulated by the coordination, Tpy-Zn2+-MC and Tpy-MC show obviously different fading rate with the achievement of time-resolved multicolor optical switches.

Despite advancements in detection and prevention technologies and approaches, the complexity of digital environments and the ingenuity of insiders remain a problem. We propose an encryption algorithm called Securecipher, specifically designed to protect file systems from insider threats. The requirements that an algorithm must meet in this context are outlined, along with a method for its development. A context-based key generation mechanism is introduced, eliminating the need for key storage. A file marking mechanism is proposed that enables protection of the encryption algorithm against specific insider threat attacks. The proposed encryption algorithm meets the requirements posed by insider threats and has successfully passed 87 % of the NIST tests, equivalent to 13 out of 15 tests passed. Compared to conventional algorithms, the proposed encryption algorithm is more efficient in the context of insider threats, allowing access to distant locations instantaneously. In the specific case of the comparison with the RC4 algorithm, it showed a 0.25 s higher speed when accessing the last position of a 128-bytes file. Furthermore, a significant increase in the vocabulary of the encrypted text with Securecipher compared to the original text is observed, approximately 42 times more. © 2024"

Assessing availability and reliability in many circumstances and environments is critical. Researchers have recently focused on investigating and analyzing new multimedia networks with artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to achieve higher data rates and secure communication traffic between parties. User information privacy and security are of vital importance and of growing concerns that present evolving challenges to overcome in preventing attacks. Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is considered one of the most common attacks, where an attacker can impersonate one of the parties in a communication system to steal user data or forge the malicious data. Due to the limitation of using conventional cryptographic techniques for mobile networks and similar systems, new methods have been introduced to validate and authenticate transmitted signals dynamically, depending on the physical layer. In this paper, we present the distance-time directional delay (DTDD) model to detect the MITM attack in a variety of contexts and scenario. Indoor hotspots (InH) and urban micro-cellular (UMi) propagation environments were investigated to verify the reliability of the proposed approaches using realistic 5G millimeter-wave configurations and system setups. Simulations have been constructed based on the mmWave 5G channel simulator tool NYUSIM, in conjunction with a collection of machine learning algorithms (ML) including the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) as the core of the presented models and methodologies. Numerical simulations results produced a detection accuracy approaching 100% in the InH environment scenario, whereas for UMi environment scenario, a detection accuracy approaching 99% was attained. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

These D–π–A type organic blue-light emitters were fine-tuned by varying the electron donating strengths of donor (D) groups appended on quinoxaline acceptor (A) through a π-spacer. These compounds are emissive in both solid and solution states. This D–π–A arrangement resulted in intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), which led to positive solvatochromism. The analysis of single crystals of QXD1 and QXD3 revealed a twisted structure with herringbone packing arrangement. AIEE behavior could be seen in THF-H2O mixtures in these compounds. Adding trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) solution to these QXDs led to fluorochromic changes from blue to yellow fluorescence in solution, which was reversed upon adding triethylamine (TEA). A similar reversible fluorochromic change was observed upon the exposure of solid QXDs to TFA vapors, followed by TEA vapors. The distinguishable fluorocolorimetric responses of QXD3 and QXD4 towards TFA were employed for data protection through encryption and decryption. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Owing to the high usage of networks, sensors, and connected devices, Smart Cities generate a massive amount of data. Therefore, Smart City security concerns encompass data privacy, Internet-of-Things (IoT) vulnerabilities, cyber threats, and urban infrastructure risks, requiring robust solutions to safeguard digital assets, citizens, and critical services. Some solutions include robust cybersecurity measures, data encryption, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven threat detection, public–private partnerships, standardized security protocols, and community engagement to foster a resilient and secure smart city ecosystem. For example, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) helps in real-time monitoring, threat detection, and incident response by aggregating and analyzing security data. To this end, no integrated systems are operating in this context. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Architecture for bolstering Smart City security that exploits Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and SIEM to provide security based on Quantum Artificial Intelligence and patterns/rules. The validity of the hybrid quantum-classical architecture was proven by conducting experiments and a comparison of the QML algorithms with state-of-the-art AI algorithms. We also provide a proof of concept dashboard for the proposed architecture. © 2024 The Author(s)"

An intrusion detection implementation defends the veracity of the data sharing confining record are stored in a data base by recognizing when something changed unpredictably so that security and privacy are major anxieties. Therefore, it is crucial to develop the security apparatus that perceive and mitigate any feasible attack in cloud security services. In this paper, we proposed secure access control method with two-fold revocation for ensuring cloud computing security by hybrid blockchain (AI-Hybrid chain). Initially, all the users and services are registered their credentials to Secure Agent (SA) and provides image-based user authentication. Then, SA provides a long-term secret key which is generated by Improved Advanced Encryption Standard (IAES) algorithm, both user and service credentials are encrypted and stored in cloud chain. After that, gateway verifies the incoming requests are legitimate or illegitimate. For verifying the incoming packets, the proposed work utilizes Di-Fuzzy Inference System (Di-FIS) based on effective metrics. Further, legitimate request is optimally classified as sensitive and non-sensitive request for achieving secure service allocation using Tomtit Flock Optimization algorithm (TFO) based on optimal features. Once the service is allocated to users, we perform novel access control mechanism based on role and attribute of the users, the trust can be validated using Transfer Learning based Double Deep Q Network (TL-DDQN). Furthermore, virtual firewall is deployed in the cloud environment for analyzing the user storage request traffic as normal validated using Transfer Learning based Double Deep Q Network (TL-DDQN). Furthermore, virtual firewall is deployed in the cloud environment for analyzing the user storage request traffic as normal and malicious based on Contractive Residual Network (Con-ResNet).

IoT security is a critical concern, and it can be settled by using cryptographic algorithms such as advanced encryption standard (AES) for encryption and authentication. A fundamental component within the AES algorithm is the substitution box (S-box), which generates confusion and nonlinearity between plaintext and ciphertext, strengthening the process of security. This paper introduces a comparative analysis to offer valuable knowledge of the factors related to different S-box modifications, which will ultimately affect the design of cryptographic systems that use the AES algorithm. Then, a tailored AES algorithm is proposed for resource-constrained IoT devices by changing the standard S-box with another S-box. The new S-box reduces the rounds number and the time needed for the AES algorithm’s encryption, decryption, and key expansion. The performance of the proposed AES is assessed through various experiments. Therefore, our tailored AES with the new S-box is more secure and efficient than AES with a standard S-box. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved."

A critical element regarding the security of QKD protocols is the photon number coherence (PNC), i.e., the phase relation between the vacuum and one-photon Fock state. To obtain single photons with the desired properties for QKD protocols, optimal excitation schemes for quantum emitters need to be selected. As emitters, we consider semiconductor quantum dots, that are known to generate on-demand single photons with high purity and indistinguishability. Exploiting two-photon excitation of a quantum dot combined with a stimulation pulse, we demonstrate the generation of high-quality single photons with a controllable degree of PNC. The main tuning knob is the pulse area giving full control from minimal to maximal PNC, while without the stimulating pulse the PNC is negligible in our setup for all pulse areas.

In this paper, a terbium and copper bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (Tbx/Cu1-x-BTC) was designed for the visualization and detection of GSH in food. Terbium ions in the Tbx/Cu1-x-BTC provide the background signal and act as an aggregation center. After reduction and aggregation-induced emission (AIE), GSH-modified copper nanoclusters (GSH-Cu NCs) enhance the red fluorescence and keep the green fluorescence unchanged. This results in a color shift of the system from green to orange. Combined with a smartphone, the RGB value of the system color was extracted to realize the visual detection of GSH. Due to the specificity of the reaction, Tbx/Cu1-x-BTC was able to specifically recognize GSH among GSH structural analogs with very good selectivity, anti-interference ability, sensitivity and accuracy. In addition, using the difference in color and excitation wavelength range between the probe and the reaction product, the probe was applied in the field of information encryption, which further expanded the application scenario of the probe. Therefore, this study provides new ideas for the detection of GSH in food and the application of fluorescence probes in the field of information encryption. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Network densification demands smaller coverage areas for base stations that are strategically deployed near consumers to support multiple services. This results in more frequently triggered handover processes. To reduce the latency induced by the handover process and ensure service continuity, this paper proposes a seamless vehicle group handover authentication protocol named SVGHP. The proposed protocol utilizes lightweight algorithms such as quadratic residual and symmetric encryption, and generates and distributes keys for group members based on the Chinese Residual Theorem to achieve handover authentication. Secondly, SVGHP includes a re-authentication phase, specifically, the vehicle group and the subsequent base stations receive the updated keys distributed by the previous RSUs for simplified authentication. And the involvement of the cloud server is avoided, eliminating the network communication delay to the core network. Detailed performance evaluation and comparison with existing protocols demonstrates that the proposed protocol is efficient in terms of computational cost and communication overhead. And in general, our scheme reduces the handover delay by at least 67.91% over the previous authentication schemes. We also provide formal and informal security proofs to prove that our protocol meets common security requirements. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Notably, our gates demonstrate high fidelity of up to 99.6(2)%, as characterized by quantum process tomography. Our experimental implementation of these gates involves a programmable array of phase layers in a compact and scalable device, capable of performing complex operations or even quantum circuits.

Mitigating DGAs in high-speed networks can be challenging, as it often requires resource-intensive tasks such as extracting high-dimensional features from domain names or collecting extensive network heuristics. In this paper, we propose an innovative framework leveraging the flexibility, per-packet granularity, and Terabits per second (Tbps) processing capabilities of P4 programmable data plane switches for the rapid and accurate detection and classification of DGA families. Specifically, we use P4 switches to extract a combination of unique network heuristics and domain name features through shallow and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) with minimal impact on throughput. We employ a two-fold approach, comprising a line-rate compact Machine Learning (ML) classifier in the data plane for DGA detection and a more comprehensive classifier in the control plane for DGA detection and classification. To validate our approach, we collected malware samples totaling hundreds of Gigabytes (GBs), representing over 50 DGA families, and utilized campus traffic from normal benign users. Our results demonstrate that our proposed approach can swiftly and accurately detect DGAs with an accuracy of 97% and 99% in the data plane and the control plane, respectively. Furthermore, we present promising findings and preliminary results for detecting DGAs in encrypted Domain Name System (DNS) traffic. Our framework enables the immediate halting of malicious communications, empowering network operators to implement effective mitigation, incident management, and provisioning strategies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

In addition, a W-TENG induces unpredictable chaotic outputs from wind flow that can serve as an entropy source for cryptography. This can be applied to a true random number generator (TRNG) for a secured system due to its inherent turbulent nature; thus, a W-TENG with a two-in-one structure can simultaneously generate both power and true random numbers. However, a previously reported W-TENG had one major drawback: a wind velocity of 10 m/s is required for stable energy harvesting by wind force. Thus, it is timely to demonstrate a W-TENG-based RNG whose operating condition is below 3 m/s, which is a gentle breeze similar to natural wind. In this study, we demonstrate a wind-driven cryptographic triboelectric random number generator (WCT-RNG) by using a W-TENG whose operating condition for wind speed is below 3 m/s by adopting a rear-fixed film structure instead of a conventional structure. The rear-fixed film refers to the fluttering film being freestanding on the front-side and fixed on the rear-side, where the front- and rear-sides are the wind inlet and outlet, respectively. The WCT-RNG enables the W-TENG to operate below a 3 m/s wind velocity. Because of this, the working time of the WCT-RNG is dramatically enhanced from only 8–42% at an average altitude above sea level. As the capability of operating at low wind speeds is significantly improved, a WCT-RNG becomes more useful and practical for generating both power and true random numbers in a single device. The device can thereby lead to the construction of a self-powered TRNG and secure communication for Internet of Things (IoT) devices in various environments, even under a gentle breeze. In this study, we explain the design of a WCT-RNG structure and also evaluate its randomness by using an NIST SP 800-22 B test suite with a reliability test. © 2024, The Author(s)."

As a foundation of secure communication, authenticated key agreement (AKA) scheme has been recognized as a promising approach to solve such problems. However, most existing AKA schemes are based on the cloud-based architecture, privacy and security issues will inevitably occur once the centralized authority is attacked. Besides, most previous schemes require an online registration authority for authentication, which may consume significant resources. To address these drawbacks, for secure data sharing in cloud computing, a blockchain-assisted full-session key agreement scheme is proposed. After the registration phase, the registration authority does not engage in authentication and key agreement process. By utilizing blockchain technology, a common session key between the remote user and cloud server can be negotiated, and a shared group key among multiple remote users can be negotiated without private information leakage. Formal and informal security proof demonstrated the proposed scheme is able to meet the security and privacy requirements.

However, conventional photochromic materials exhibit sluggish coding rates and a deficiency in intelligent response for writing and erasing under multiple excitation sources. This deficiency contributes to suboptimal readout/decoding efficiency and storage security. Here, we show a Ba2NaNb5O15:Er3+ photochromic material with photoluminescence reversible modulation that can fast respond to both ultraviolet light and 532 nm laser within about 1 s, which accompanied by thermal bleaching. The PC mechanism which is based on defect state exchanges between oxygen vacancy defects and color centers is attributed to the structural flexibility of Nb-O systems and oxygen vacancy increased under irradiation. More importantly, it shows differential PC decay behavior in response to X-ray and UV light due to the difference in the number of trapped carriers.

Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) offer a sustainable resource for developing information protection materials. In this study, we present an approach that is easy to implement and adapt for the covalent attachment of various fluorescence molecules onto the surface of CNCs using the Mannich reaction in aqueous-based medium. Through the use of the Mannich reaction-based surface modification technique, we successfully achieved multi-color fluorescence in the resulting CNCs. The resulting CNC derivatives were thoroughly characterized by two dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance (2D HSQC NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopy. Notably, the optical properties of CNCs were well maintained after modification, resulting in films exhibiting blue and red structural colors. This enables the engineering of highly programmable and securely encoded anti-counterfeit labels. Moreover, subsequent coating of the modified CNCs with MXene yielded a highly secure encrypted matrix, offering advanced security and encryption capabilities under ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared wavelengths. This CNC surface-modification enables the development of multimodal security labels with potential applications across various practical scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Most of these devices have access to important personal data such as health, daily activities, location, and finance. However, these devices have security problems since they have limited processing power and memory to implement complex security measures. Therefore, they possess weak authentication mechanisms and a lack of encryption. Additionally, there are no widely accepted standards for IoT security. Device Identifier Composition Engine (DICE) was proposed as a standard that enables adding a security layer to low-cost microcontrollers with minimal silicon overhead. However, previous studies show that DICE-based attestation is vulnerable to some remote attacks. In this study, we present a novel method called DICEguard to address the security problems of DICE. One of the key innovations of DICEguard is its incorporation of periodic memory forensics (PMF) technique, leveraging a hardware-based hash engine to detect and mitigate potential security breaches resulting from firmware vulnerabilities. DICEguard enhances the overall resilience of IoT devices against attacks by swiftly detecting alterations indicative of malicious activity through periodic calculation and comparison of firmware digests. Furthermore, DICEguard introduces a one-time programmable (OTP) memory component to safeguard critical security parameters, such as public keys used for signature verification, against tampering by adversaries. This ensures the integrity of essential security measures even in the face of sophisticated attacks. We implemented the enhanced DICE architecture using the open-source RISC-V platform Ibex and the mbedTLS library for cryptographic operations. We performed the hash operations required by DICE in a hardware-based manner on a commercial Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform rather than firmware, which is more vulnerable to attacks. Our test results show that with negligible area overhead to a standard microcontroller system, the proposed method can detect the simulated attacks. © The Author(s) 2024."

New solutions that do not require complex calculations, such as certificateless cryptography, attract great attention from researchers. To resolve these difficulties, Wang et al. designed a new authentication architecture for the WBANs environment, which was claimed to be secure and efficient. However, in this paper, we will show that this scheme is prone to ephemeral key leakage attacks. Further, based on this authentication scheme, an anonymous certificateless scheme is proposed for lightweight devices. Meanwhile, user anonymity is fully protected.

Group signature permits the members of a group to sign a document on behalf of the entire group keeping signer’s identity secret and enabling disclosure of the signer’s identity if required. In this work, we present the first code-based fully-dynamic group signature scheme which allows group members to join or leave the group at any point of time. We employ a code-based updatable Merkle-tree accumulator in our design to achieve logarithmic-size signature and utilize randomized Niederreiter encryption to trace the identity of the signer. More positively, we equipped our scheme with deniability characteristic whereby the tracing authority can furnish evidence showing that a given member is not the signer of a particular signature. Our scheme satisfies the security requirements of anonymity, non-frameability, traceability and tracing-soundness in the random oracle model under the hardness of generic decoding problem.

A federation among these computing paradigms is beneficial, as it enhances the capability, capacity, coverage, and services of cloud, edge, and fog. An authentication method is needed to realize such a federation among cloud, edge, and fog so that a user belonging to one of these computing paradigms can use the services offered by other computing paradigms in the federation without creating a new account. This paper proposes a standard-compliant universal federator that transparently provides third-party authentication among different protocols, used by cloud, edge, and fog, such as 3GPP EPS-AKA, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and 802.1x. The federator provides transparency by using a controller and modules that act as virtual counterparts of the authentication entities in EPS-AKA, OIDC, and 802.1x. These virtual counterparts play multiple roles, depending upon the involved protocols. We deployed a testbed, published our implementation on GitHub, and tested third-party authentication for 16 scenarios across EPS-AKA, OIDC, and 802.1x. The results show that our federator successfully provides third-party authentication while taking 4.07–51.8% of the total authentication time, which ranges between 1.193–3.825 s for 16 scenarios. Some scenarios involving 802.1x take considerably longer due to the bottleneck caused by the 802.1x switch. We also conducted a security analysis to show that our proposed federator fulfills multiple security requirements. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

By randomizing each local privacy-sensitive initial state with an i.i.d. Gaussian noise and the output of the mechanism using Gaussian noises, it is shown that the resulting average consensus algorithm can eliminate the gap in the sense that the accuracy-privacy trade-off of the centralized averaging approach with differential privacy can be almost recovered by appropriately designing the variances of the added noises.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel secure and efficient fine-grained TPE scheme (FG-TPE), specifically, the image pixels are firstly divided into blocks, and multiple rounds of neighboring pixel substitution and permutation fine-grained encryption operations are performed in each block to achieve obfuscated protection of sensitive feature information of the image. Then, the state transfer process of image pixel encryption is reduction to the adversarial detection in a stochastic environment, and the optimal encryption rounds bounds are found by Kalman filtering method. Finally, experiments conducted on two face datasets show that, in qualitative and quantitative comparisons, the average encryption time is decreased remarkably, improved encryption efficiency, and the ciphertext expansion rate is reduced by 19.6% on average, possessing a better image spatiality when compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

This paper delves into template protection in palmprint recognition. The existing template protection methods usually cannot strike a well balance between security, accuracy and usability, which reduces the applicability of the algorithms. In this work, a data-centric approach for palmprint template protection is proposed, called PalmSecMatch. Our solution extracts the key from plaintext data. It extremely reduces the dependency on third-party or independent key generation algorithms. The backbone of PalmSecMatch consists of key data extraction and encryption, order shuffling of the raw vectors, hashing code generation, shuffling basis and hashing code fading. PalmSecMatch subtly exploits the fact that biometric data are random variables and benefits from its data-centric nature. PalmSecMatch allows the same plaintext features to be encrypted into highly different ciphertexts, which greatly ensures security. At the same time, the application of data fading strategy makes it extremely difficult for an attacker to distinguish the user data from the auxiliary data. The security analysis shows that PalmSecMatch satisfies the requirements of ISO/IEC 24745. Adequate experiments on two public palmprint databases validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The elliptic curve cryptography attracted interest due to the development of modern technology since it could offer the equivalent high level of security with a reduced length of key. Therefore, improving elliptic curve scalar multiplication performance has always been the primary goal of cryptography. In this paper, a novel scalar multiplication algorithm based on the modified double and double add via elliptic net with Karatsuba method was proposed in order to enhance the efficiency of scalar multiplication. In the experimental results, the elliptic net equivalence sequence was applied to the Twisted Edwards curve together with safe curves of numsp384t1 and numsp512t1. At the point operational level, the proposed method reduced the cost of multiplication by 46.15% and 42.30% for double and double add, respectively, when compared to elliptic net using eight blocks method. The proposed double lowered the multiplication cost by 12.5% and the squaring cost by 20% when compared to elliptic net using ten temporary variables method. Following this, proposed double add cost reductions of 6.25% and 20% were obtained to multiplication and squaring. At the field operational level, in comparison to the binary method, the eight-block elliptic net method, and the elliptic net method with ten temporary variables for the 384 bits scenario, the developed scalar multiplication algorithm obtained cost reductions of 57.6%, 31.3%, and 13.2%, respectively. On 512 bits with similar comparison, the designed algorithm exhibited better performance by averages 59.2%, 31.0% and 13.2%. The results signified that the designed algorithm over prime field performed better at the point and field operational levels with larger scalar bit size. © 2024, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Implementing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) based on machine learning (ML) can address these security challenges effectively. However, existing ML-based IDSs have limited classification capabilities, lack adaptability and time sensitivity, incomprehensive analysis, and produce high false-negative rates (FNR), while attack schemes are becoming increasingly complex, resulting in insufficient capability of intrusion detection in real-time and insufficient ability to offer reliable protection. Therefore, our study proposes a novel in-vehicle IDS for multiclass classification using both packet- and sequence-level characteristics extracted from an autoencoder and a variant transformer (Time-embedded Transformer) with an improved position encoding mechanism, which analyses CAN traffic in-depth from various perspectives to overcome the existing challenges above. Both standard (Car-Hacking) and advanced (ROAD) datasets are used to evaluate the capabilities of our proposed IDS. The evaluation results demonstrated 100 % detection accuracy and 0 % FNR for both the Car-Hacking and ROAD Masquerade datasets, which also peaked at the highest F1 score for the ROAD Fabrication dataset, emphasizing superior intrusion detection to minimize FNR of the proposed model with high adaptability through its multi-dimensional analysis at packet- and sequence-level. © 2024"

The current SPH-FDM model improves grid encryption method, and expand the single-phase SPH-FDM to multiphase SPH-FDM. The results from SPH-FDM align closely with those from the published experimental measurements. Following the successful validations, SPH-FDM and experiment are employed for a series of simulations to investigate the performance of the OWC device. Compared to experimental method, SPH-FDM can obtain global flow field information and avoid the influence of free surface identification and capillarity on vortex determination. In addition, SPH-FDM can naturally captures free surfaces, so it supports further studies on the non-uniformity of water surface in the chamber of OWC which cannot be studied by PIV or pneumatic model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Confidentiality of MR is a concerning issue that needs to be taken care of with an effective approach. Therefore, to provide a suitable remedial action against these undesirable security issues, a watermarking technique is used. Thus, this paper presents a secured novel watermarking technique that uses salient features of redundant discrete wavelet transform (RDWT), multiresolution singular value decomposition (MSVD), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). This method involves the computation of a medical image's region of interest (ROI) through an ROI-based filtering approach. A hybrid watermark is generated with Aadhar and barcode images embedded into the transformed cover medical image. ANFIS plays a vital role in deciding the optimal value of the embedding strength, facilitating a proper trade-off among different characteristics. Blockchain encryption is also carried out to authenticate the hybrid watermark using this approach. This authentication feature aids in protecting vital medical data, which ensures better copyright protection.

The popularity of this method requires strong privacy-preserving technology to prevent the disclosure of template information. Most of the existing privacy protection technologies rely on classic encryption techniques, such as homomorphic encryption, which incur huge system overhead and cannot be popularized. To address these issues, we propose a novel biometric authentication scheme with privacy protection based on support vector machine and zero knowledge proof (BioAu–SVM+ZKP). BioAu–SVM+ZKP allows users to authenticate themselves to different service providers without disclosing any biometric template information. The evidence is generated through the zero-knowledge proof utilizing polynomial commitments. Our approach for generating a unique and repeatable biometric identifier from the user's fingerprint image leverages the multi-classification property of SVM. Notably, our scheme not only reduces the communication overhead but also provides the privacy protection features. Besides, the communication overhead of BioAu–SVM+ZKP is constant. We have simulated the authentication scheme on the common dataset NIST, analyzed the performance and proved the security. © 2024 The Authors"

In this paper, a new memristive State-Controlled-CNN (MSC-CNN) model is established by introducing two novel flux-controlled memristors into a three-cell network, where one of which simulates the electromagnetic radiation and the other characterizes the coupling weight. The present MSC-CNN can generate multi-double-scroll attractors (MDSAs) in one direction or grid multi-double-scroll attractors (GMDSAs). Stability analysis shows that each asymptotically stable equilibrium point of the memristors serves as index-1 saddle-focus in the MSC-CNN, which induces the corresponding connecting bond orbits between two scrolls. Thus, the number of GMDSAs can be flexibly adjusted by varying the number of the asymptotically stable equilibrium points of the memristors. Moreover, the memristive coupling strength also controls the number of MDSAs. Through numerical simulations, complex dynamic behaviors such as extreme multistability and amplitude control are also observed. Then, an image encryption scheme based on the proposed MSC-CNN is designed from the application perspective. Finally, a microcontroller-based hardware system is implemented to verify the effectiveness of numerical simulations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

With this expansion, THz wireless communication has the potential to achieve ultra-high data transmission rates of up to 100 Gbit/s. However, as large amounts of data are transmitted in an open wireless environment, there are significant concerns regarding communication security due to the susceptibility to eavesdropping, interception, and jamming. In this work, we proposed a secure approach for THz wireless communication based on spatial wave mixing and flexible beam steering. To achieve this, two frequency-modulated THz waves, which are generated by photonic THz sources and carry encrypted information with true randomness, are mixed at a THz envelope detector with an exclusive-OR logic operation. We analyzed the possible spatial location for the THz detector to ensure a secure microcell network deployment. Our results demonstrate that the size of the decryptable region is directly dependent on the directivity and width of the emitted THz beam. To address this, we have developed an array antenna with integrated uni-traveling-carrier photodiodes (UTC-PDs), which is capable of generating THz waves while also improving the flexibility of beam pointing, allowing for greater control over the location and size of the decodable region. By controlling fiber-optic delay lines, we successfully demonstrated that the directional gain of a 200 GHz wave is increased by 8 dB through a 1 × 3 UTC-PD-integrated planar bowtie antenna (PBA) array, together with continuous beam steering from -20° to 10°. Additionally, using a 1 × 4 UTC-PD-integrated PBA array to emulate two encryption transmitters and a Femi-level managed barrier diode to detect spatially mixed THz waves, we successfully achieved a feasibility experiment for real-time 200 Mbit/s location-based decryption in the 200 GHz band. These results indicate that the proposed scheme is feasible for secured THz communication, and would be a powerful candidate to mitigate security risks in 6G microcell networks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

In these areas, sensory data, which is collected from multiple sources and managed through intermediate processing by multiple nodes, is used for decision-making processes. Ensuring data integrity and keeping track of data provenance are core requirements in such a highly dynamic context, since data provenance is an important tool for the assurance of data trustworthiness. Dealing with such requirements is challenging due to the limited computational and energy resources in IoT networks. This requires addressing several challenges such as processing overhead, secure provenance, bandwidth consumption and storage efficiency. In this paper, we propose Zero-watermarkIng based data pRovenanCe for iOt Networks (ZIRCON), a novel zero-watermarking approach to securely transmit provenance and ensure data integrity of sensor data in an IoT network. In ZIRCON, provenance information is stored in a tamper-proof network database through watermarks, generated at the source node before transmission. We provide an extensive security analysis showing the resilience of our scheme against passive and active attacks. We also compare our scheme with existing works based on performance metrics such as computational time, energy usage, and cost analysis.

The offset boosting and the operation of complex number are applied to several cases, including the seed chaotic systems with no equilibrium, with single unstable node, or with single stable node-focus. In specific, the offset boosting shifts the single non-zero equilibrium to the origin, then the operation of complex number rules out the equilibrium in the folded system and generates multi-fold trajectories. The highlight is that the proposed approach is not limited to the no-equilibrium seed system, but also applicable for different types of single-equilibrium seed systems, even the seed system with a single line of equilibrium.

These beams, known for their spatially varying polarization distribution are generated by the superposition of different magnitude of optical vortex modes modulated into orthogonal polarization basis. Our approach harnesses the unique characteristics of light carrying spatially concatenated orthogonal states of optical vortices for image encoding unlike traditional optical cryptosystems that rely on the spatial distribution of amplitude, phase, and polarization of light. Through the superposition of phase holograms corresponding to images encoded within both the polarization components, each exhibits distinct magnitudes of optical vortex modes at each pixel. The proposed approach allows for secure image encryption into C-point vector beams. The utilization of optical vortices associated with orbital angular momentum offers flexibility in terms of allowing for the selection of infinite integer values of topological charge. This versatility inspires us to encode image using an array of vortices, thereby ensuring stable encoding and minimize quality degradation in practical implementations. Furthermore, exploiting the two orthogonal polarization components of light enhances high-dimensional encoding, offering a solution to the ‘capacity crunch’ issue in secure optical communication systems. Manipulation within two degrees of freedom of light is demonstrated through a non-interferometric experimental set-up employing dual-pass modulation approach which simplifies vector beam generation. © 2024"

Particularly, PMCSSs with wavelength-selective and time-resolved color switching are highly important but underexplored. Here, a new strategy is proposed to realize wavelength-selective, time-resolved, and visible-light-responsive PMCSSs by integrating acetamide ligand-capping CdS (CdS-NH2) nanoparticles and various redox dyes in solid films for multistate dynamic information encryption. The –NH2 groups of surface-bounded CH3CONH2 act as sacrificial electron donors for scavenging photogenerated holes to endow the CdS-NH2 nanoparticles high photoreductive ability and activity in a broad visible light range from 400 to 515 nm, thus enabling the long-waited wavelength-selective multicolor switching via coupling the wavelength-dependent photoreductivity of CdS-NH2 nanoparticles and the discoloration kinetics of redox dyes, such as methylene blue (MB) and phenosafranine (PS). Moreover, the time-dependent color switching during recoloration process of the color switching system can be modulated by tuning the oxidation kinetics of MB and methylene green (MG), enabling time-resolved dynamic imaging characteristics.

As a promising material, the application of perovskite luminescent materials in information encryption is limited to pre-planned specific scenarios or applications, lacking the ability to respond to temporary demands. In this work, we have designed a novel cadmium-based zero-dimensional perovskite, TEA2CdCl4, which presents blue luminescence centered at 413 nm originating from organic cations. Upon Sb3+ doping, it not only exhibits intense red emission at 623 nm with a high photoluminescence quantum efficiency up to 100 %, but also brings outstanding resistance to thermal quenching. Especially, an ultrafast response speed could be achieved during decryption process which has been verified by first-principles calculations. Based on the advantages, a large-area optical anti-counterfeiting paper for temporary information encryption transmission is designed, which not only verifies the potential for secure information transmission and protection, but also introduces a new concept for the application of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites in the field of information encryption. © 2024"

Several RDHEI methods have been proposed to balance the privacy and security of images in cloud environments. However, they can only embed less identifier information. Recently, a novel encoding technology called parametric binary tree labeling (PBTL) has gained popularity. However, existing PBTL-based schemes either inefficiently encode non-embeddable pixels or leave them unprocessed. In light of this issue, we propose an efficient parametric binary tree labeling method for RDHEI (EPBTL-RDHEI). In the pixel division, we design a novel EPBTL encoding rule to encode all pixels except reference pixels into three groups including non-embeddable pixels, embeddable pixels, and self-recording pixels. In this way, the length of auxiliary information is reduced. Furthermore, we derive theoretical conditions for the improved embedding performance with the introduction of self-recording pixels. Experiments demonstrate that the payload capacity of our presented EPBTL encoding surpasses that of the state-of-the-art RDHEI schemes. The average embedding rates on public datasets such as BOSSbase, BOWS-2, and UCID reach up to 2.667, 2.637, and 2.370 bpp (bit per pixel) with a full reversibility, and the improvement percentages are up to 175.24%, 232.80%, and 1,842.29% compared to the two comparative PBTL-based methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Access control is particularly important for IoMT due to the sensitive nature of patient data, such as electronic health records (EHR). Although fine-grained access control can be achieved by attribute-based signature (ABS), existing ABS schemes lacks the ability to provide range comparison access policy in which patients can check whether the attribute value is within a certain range. In addition, the dynamic change of doctors’ permissions and the development of quantum technology also require that ABS can provide user revocation and resist quantum attacks. In order to solve these problems and make ABS schemes for IoMT more useful and more secure, we come up with a novel revocable and comparable ABS (RC-ABS) from lattices for IoMT, enabling fine-grained access control, attribute range comparison, and user revocation. First of all, we provide a proof of the unforgeability of our scheme in the standard model (SM) under the selective user revocation list semi-adaptive attribute adaptive message attack, which can resist attacks by semi-honest adversaries and prevent adversaries from attacking the weaknesses of hash functions in IoMT. Furthermore, our ABS scheme leverages the small integer solution problem (SIS) to effectively defends against quantum algorithm attacks. Finally, detailed performance analysis demonstrates that our solution not only possesses enhanced security features and functionalities, such as revocability, comparability, and resistance against quantum attacks, but also maintains a constant computation cost of user revocation, making it more efficient compared to other revocation schemes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

To resolve the conflict between the difficulty of malicious encrypted traffic detection and the requirements of traffic privacy protection, we propose a cloud-assisted Industrial Internet malicious encrypted traffic detection scheme with privacy protection. To accurately match the encrypted traffic and the detection rules, a privacy set intersection protocol based on the oblivious pseudorandom function and random garbled Bloom filter is constructed, which can detect malicious traffic without revealing data content. Meanwhile, our scheme can allow semi-trusted cloud servers to assist resource-constrained end devices to participate in private calculations. The key-homomorphic encryption is introduced to obfuscate the detection rules, making the detection rules always transparent to end users and semi-trusted cloud servers. We also design the random input verification to make the malicious end users do not have any opportunity to participate in the privacy set intersection calculation using arbitrary data.

Various novel federated learning methods address these challenges but often require significant communication resources and local computational capacity, leading to reduced global inference accuracy in scenarios with imbalanced label data distribution and quantity skew. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedVGL, a Federated Variational Generative Learning method that directly trains a local generative model to learn the distribution of local features and improve global target model inference accuracy during aggregation, particularly under conditions of severe data heterogeneity. FedVGL facilitates distributed learning by sharing generators and latent vectors with the global server, aiding in global target model training from mapping local data distribution to the variational latent space for feature reconstruction. Additionally, FedVGL implements anonymization and encryption techniques to bolster privacy during generative model transmission and aggregation. In comparison to vanilla federated learning, FedVGL minimizes communication overhead, demonstrating superior accuracy even with minimal communication rounds. It effectively mitigates model drift in scenarios with heterogeneous data, delivering improved target model training outcomes. Empirical results establish FedVGL's superiority over baseline federated learning methods under severe label imbalance and data skew condition.

Nonetheless, in terms of data utility, most existing strategies only consider high-priority power consumers, neglecting the priority of power suppliers and low-priority power consumers, thus damaging the fairness of low-priority consumers and the interests of power suppliers, to the detriment of these groups. Moreover, smart meters are vulnerable to data integrity attacks, which may result in the manipulation of measured user information during the forwarding process, thereby disrupting normal priority-based energy scheduling. Therefore, focusing on data utility without considering data security is insufficient. Researchers have extensively investigated how to secure smart meters within advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), primarily employing cryptography-based methods to encrypt user information in measured meters and decrypt it at the microgrid central controller (MGCC), thereby protecting the data confidentiality of user information during the forwarding process and preventing data tampering. However, the prevailing cryptographic methods used to secure smart meters are extremely complex, and make smart meters and local controllers on the forwarding path unable to obtain any user information in which embedded consumers’ priority and cannot leverage the data utility of priority to forward information accordingly. In other words, existing models cannot simultaneously achieve data confidentiality and data utility during the forwarding process. To solve these issues, this study investigates a Lightweight_PAEKS-based energy scheduling model considering priority in microgrid (LPESCP). As a lightweight solution, the LPESCP comprehensively considers data confidentiality and data utility, as well as the priority and fairness of all users, to ensure the security of smart meters and optimize energy scheduling. In particular, the data utility problem is solved by using an optimization model that aims to maximize the global satisfaction degree of all users in terms of priority and fairness. The Lightweight_PAEKS and Paillier encryption scheme are used so that nodes on the forwarding path can successfully match priority-related keyword and forward information in order of the keyword corresponding emergency coefficient indicating the urgency levels of information, ensuring data utility, while do not know the specific keyword, emergency coefficient and other information, ensuring data confidentiality. To verify the effectiveness of the LPESCP, experiments are conducted for three cases generated based on random numbers. The results show that the LPESCP model can effectively ensure energy supply to consumers, comprehensively considering data confidentiality and utility as well as priority and fairness of all users. In addition, the global satisfaction degree and time overhead are introduced as metrics to verify that the LPESCP strategy is more effective in providing greater global satisfaction degree and lower time overhead than existing priority-based energy scheduling models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

A vast amount of business data and private data are continuously uploaded to the cloud platform, driven by a series of attractive services offered by the cloud. Unfortunately, once data is uploaded to the cloud, its owner has no way of ensuring that it is actually deleted as intended. This obviously increases the concerns of data owners about the security of their data, because it is related to the privacy of users. Therefore, there must be a reliable solution to prove that data is deleted as requested by users, to prevent data leakage or abuse. In existing data deletion schemes, most are designed based on cryptographic knowledge rather than erasure or overwrite techniques, in order not to cause incalculable damage to the storage medium. However, most cryptographic-based data deletion schemes, particularly attribute-based encryption, involve numerous complex bilinear mapping operations, which are expensive for most devices. To address this issue, the paper proposes an Efficient and Verifiable Scheme for Secure Data Deletion (EVSD). Firstly, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is introduced to achieve efficient encryption of data. Then, leveraging Linear Secret Sharing Scheme (LSSS), fine-grained data deletion policies supporting logical operations are implemented. Finally, the deletion of the data is efficiently verified using the root of the Merkle Hash Tree (MHT) generated by the defined illegal and legal attributes, while the deletion proof is also generated. Satisfactorily, security analysis shows that the EVSD scheme is much more advantageous compared to existing schemes, and a trait likewise is also observed in the performance evaluation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

This paper introduces a novel approach to detect attacks on the Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol within MANETs, specifically those involving malicious nodes masquerading as best routing paths by manipulating AODV's sequence numbers. An extension to the AODV protocol is introduced to ensure secure communication between different nodes in MANET. The proposed security mechanism includes a signature verification mechanism based on the Edwards digital signature curve (Ed25519), which is demonstrated on the Objective Modular Network Testbed in C++ (OMNet++) simulator. Our solution employs an extension to AODV protocol where asymmetric cryptography is introduced to generate and authenticate digital signatures, ensuring a high level of security. Additionally, a novel detection mechanism is introduced to identify malicious nodes within the network as a supplementary security layer. Simulation results demonstrate a high detection rate, accurately identifying between 83 % and 100 % of malicious nodes based on their presence in the network. © 2024"

This research explores variations in cybersecurity learning based on gender using the frameworks of self-determination and social cognitive theories. Conducted over two years, the research utilized a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform to facilitate learning and assess outcomes. This study explores the gender disparities in key areas such as intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, conceptual grasp, and performance across five distinct cybersecurity subdomains: web exploitation, cryptography, cyber forensics, binary exploitation, and reverse engineering. The comprehensive evaluation included participant interaction with learning materials, their adeptness in practical exercises, and their achievements in a comprehensive contest covering five essential cross-domain cybersecurity concepts. Pre- and post-study surveys were instrumental in tracking shifts in motivation and self-efficacy levels. Findings pointed to notable gender-based differences in motivational aspects and self-belief following the learning phase, with conceptual understanding and the ability to replicate challenges also varying significantly between genders, highlighting disparities in educational outcomes. Domain-based analysis reveals notable gender differences: male participants excelled in solving reverse engineering and cryptography problems, whereas female participants performed better in cyber forensics and web exploitation challenges. These findings underscore the importance of tailored educational strategies in cybersecurity training to bridge the gender gap and foster a more diverse and capable workforce, addressing both the skill shortage and the need for broader representation in the field. © 2024"

The reusability of rrFE asks the pseudo-randomness of the extracted keys, while robustness of rrFE makes sure that active attacks can be detected during the reproduction of the extracted key. With rrFE, we are able to produce cryptographic keys for our cryptosystems from fuzzy sources, like biometrics, physical unclonable functions, etc. There are rrFE schemes from the DDH, LWE and LPN assumptions. However there is no rrFE scheme from isogeny-based assumptions up to now. In this paper, we construct the first rrFE from isogeny. To obtain such an rrFE, we propose a new framework for constructing rrFE with a core technical tool, named Enhanced Effective Group Action (EEGA). EEGA is built upon the basic Effective Group Action (EGA), and is equipped with a sampling algorithm and a derivation algorithm. With such an EEGA, the same random input can be derived to produce different pseudo-random and unpredictable outputs. The EEGA, together with other routine building blocks like secure sketch and extractor, leverages an FE to achieve reusability and robustness. We construct EEGA based on CSI-FiSh, which admits the first rrFE scheme from isogeny. Besides, we also propose another two EEGA instantiations from the DDH assumption, and this provides another approach to DDH-based rrFE, which may be of independent interest. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

In view of this, a high-capacity RDHEI based on adaptive pixel modulation and high bit-plane based redundancy matrix coding (HBP-RMC) is proposed to effectively achieve patient privacy protection by embedding private data such as electronic medical records and authentication information into encrypted medical images. Specifically, the carrier image is encrypted using designed block-level disruption and adaptive pixel-modulation to preserve pixel-correlation. This method provides the basis for high embedding rates while ensuring the overall security of the image. Next, an accurate block-level pixel prediction is proposed to make full use of the high correlation to generate considerable redundancy and in balance with high prediction accuracy. Then the proposed HBP-RMC is used to maximally convert the redundant information into the embeddable space and effectively limit the size of the auxiliary information. At the decoding end, users can realize separable image restoration and information extraction according to their own keys. The maximum ERs of our scheme on the BOWS-2 and BOSSbase datasets can reach 2.9332 bpp and 3.0249 bpp, respectively.

Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-image encryption scheme based on a new n-dimensional(nD) chaotic model and eight-base DNA, which can encrypt any type, quantity and size of images. Firstly, an nD chaotic model is designed, which can generate different chaotic systems according to individual requirements, simplify the complexity of chaotic system design, and solve the problems of uneven chaotic trajectory and limited range. Secondly, some new eight-base algebraic operations are proposed, which opens up a new calculation method for DNA calculation and information processing. These algebraic operations are applied to the bidirectional diffusion process to achieve bidirectional DNA diffusion. Finally, multiple images are fused, and different keys are generated by the SHA-512 algorithm to ensure that each fused image has a unique key. Moreover, SCAN is utilized to scramble the fused image, which provides more flexibility and selectivity for image encryption and processing. Experimental simulation and security analysis verify that the proposed scheme has a superior effect and good anti-attack when encrypting multiple images with different types, quantities and sizes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

In this paper, we propose a stateful black-box encryption protocol fuzzing method to analyze the security of real-world black-box encryption protocol programs and devices. This method does not rely on the source code but uses captured packets as input, performs state selection based on a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm, and processes the encryption/decryption conversion of mutant test cases based on the intermediate mapper. It sends test cases and collects responses in interactive communication with the tested program and dynamically optimizes the corpus based on the collected state information. Based on this method, we develop SBEPFuzz and primarily analyze IPsec. We evaluate SBEPFuzz on six widely used IPsec implementations. The experimental results show that SBEPFuzz achieves higher code coverage, and can discover more protocol state sequences and vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we discover four anomalies, including malformed packets triggering service crashes and abnormal interactions leading to plaintext ID leakage, which also reflect the differences in details among different implementations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Interestingly, TPE-IP exhibited dual-band fluorescence emission in various solvents, deriving from localized and intramolecular charge transfer states. By grinding and heating, TPE-IP presented reversible mechanochromism, accompanied by a transition between deep blue and green fluorescence. Moreover, TPE-IP displayed high-contrast acidchromism, but with different responses to HCl, CF3COOH, and CH3COOH fuming.

Host-guest doping systems are highly regarded for their simplicity of preparation and the absence of complex synthesis processes. Strong RTP emission can be activated by the doping of a guest molecules, in particular by substituting the phenyl group in the host structure with a naphthalene group. In this study, derivatives of benzophenone were constructed as the host molecule, and used 2-Benzoylnaphthalene, a commercially available naphthyl-substituted analogue of benzophenone, as the guest molecule. The phosphorescent lifetime of the doped system can reach 335 ms and the phosphorescent quantum yield can reach 58 %, which is expected to be used in anti-counterfeiting encryption, biological imaging and other fields.

These hybrid materials were facilely prepared by a solution-processable method via evaporating the solvent of the BA and organics solution at room temperature. The crystalized BA provided a rigid surrounding for the organics via hydrogen bonds, which effectively inhibited the non-radiative decay of triplet excitons and gave efficient and persistent room temperature afterglow with the phosphorescent quantum yield up to 57.66%. The phosphorescence properties were almost unchanged when deuterated BA was used instead of BA, indicating the deuteration of the hydrogen bond would not suppress the non-radiative decay from the excited state. Furthermore, a phosphorescence resonance energy transfer process was achieved by introducing 4-[4-(Dimethylamino)styryl]-1-methylpyridinium iodide (DASPI) as the energy acceptor.

Traditional methods have often suffered from inefficiency, insecurity, or the requirement for additional hardware. In this study, an innovative approach to secret key generation is proposed, leveraging deep learning, facial feature extraction, genetic algorithms, and linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs). These techniques are combined to create robust, unique keys based on users' facial features. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed for the extraction of facial features from user images and for the optimization of LFSR parameters using a genetic algorithm. Furthermore, another neural network is utilized to establish a connection between facial features and the LFSR-generated output, resulting in the secret key. Rigorous evaluation of the method is conducted across various facial datasets, with a comparison against existing approaches. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, yielding secret key length of 92,706 characterized by an entropy value of 3.24, a low average correlation value of 0.1554, and a high level of security. This research represents a significant advancement in secure biometric authentication, addressing the limitations of conventional key generation methods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Nonetheless, the preparation of hydrogel-based flexible strain sensors with rapid response, wide strain detection range, and high sensitivity remains a considerable challenge. Furthermore, the inevitable freezing and evaporation of water in sub-zero temperatures and dry environments lead to the loss of flexibility and conductivity in hydrogels, which seriously limits their practical application. In this work, ionic liquids (ILs) and MXene are introduced into gelatin/polyacrylamide (PAM) precursor solution, and a PAM/gelatin/ILs/MXene/glycerol (PGIMG) hydrogel-based flexible strain sensor with MXene co-ILs ion–electron composite conductive network is prepared by combining the electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing method and in-situ photopolymerization. The introduction of ILs provides an ionic conductive channel for the hydrogel. The introduction of MXene nanosheets forms an interpenetrating network with gelatin and PAM, which not only provides a conductive channel, but also improves the mechanical and sensing properties of the hydrogel-based flexible strain sensor. The prepared PGIMG hydrogel with the MXene co-ILs ion–electron composite conductive network demonstrates a tensile strength of 0.21 MPa at 602.82 % strain, the conductivity of 1.636 × 10−3 S/cm, high sensitivity (Gauge Factor, GF = 4.17), a wide strain detection range (1–600 %), and the response/recovery times (73 ms and 74 ms). In addition, glycerol endows the hydrogel with excellent freezing (−60 °C) and water retention properties. The application of the hydrogel-based flexible strain sensor in the field of human motion detection and information transmission shows the great potential of wearable devices, electronic skin, and information encryption transmission. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

However, the existing DSSE schemes suffer from forward and backward privacy problems. Although forward and backward privacy DSSE schemes can prevent these attacks, they still suffer from other challenges, such as count attacks, high communication overhead, and low computing efficiency. To solve the above problems simultaneously, we propose a secure and efficient dynamic searchable encryption scheme, which integrates a clustering algorithm, padding strategy, and trusted execution environments (TEE). The purpose of the scheme is to prevent count attacks while ensuring forward and backward privacy security. Our scheme also reduces the computing overhead and storage cost of the client by using TEE (e.g. Intel Software Guard Extension, Intel SGX) while maximizing the protection of client privacy. Furthermore, the scheme provides a secure hardware isolation environment for the cluster padding and search/update process to prevent malicious attacks from external software or super administrators.

Current encryption techniques that allow plaintext checks primarily serve a specific cryptosystem, lacking the adaptability to work with a diverse system incorporating various cryptographic methods. To address this, we present a unique online/offline heterogeneous signcryption scheme with plaintext checkable encryption (HOOSC-PCE). This approach enables the transition of signcrypted messages from an identity-based cryptosystem (IBC) to a public key infrastructure (PKI) system, improving information interoperability. A key aspect of our scheme is its capacity to allow cloud servers to perform plaintext queries, facilitating efficient data searches using plaintext keywords over encrypted data. Furthermore, the signcryption process is divided into online and offline phases. The online phase handles tasks that require fewer resources, while the offline phase carries out more resource-intensive preparatory tasks. We rigorously tested the HOOSC-PCE scheme's security by proving it secure under the Random Oracle Model (ROM). Meanwhile, compared to similar work, it effectively reduces computation costs by 46.39%, 19.45%, 18.73%, and 13.25% across offline encryption, online encryption, decryption, and search algorithms.

However, the stored information is confronted by indecipherability at the microscale because the intrinsic relaxation of polymer chains would disrupt the fidelity of encoded information. Inspired by female Doryteuthis opalescens squid's camouflage strategy (i.e., switching a stripe on its mantle from nearly transparent to opaque white), we devised a reversible transmittance-changeable hydrogel layer to fully cover the mono-encrypted information layer for dual-encryption. The micro-structured hydrogel was manufactured via 3D printing to encode the information, which can be decoded by UV-induced fluorescent emission. Then, the white camouflage hydrogel was constructed to conceal the mono-encrypted layer, which will not affect the information encoding layer during the reversible polymer chain mobility. The information can be decoded with alkaline solution and UV irradiation in a rapid speed, i.e., in 4 min, with good reusability. Moreover, the information was accurately unveiled even at microscale resolution, holding great promise for high-level encryption at the device level. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

However, current centralized TFP systems suffer from several limitations: limited adaptability to localized traffic patterns, privacy concerns associated with sharing raw data, inability to provide real-time predictions, network inefficiency due to large data transmissions, and difficulties in handling heterogeneous traffic environments. FedGODE (Federated Graph Ordinary Differential Equations) model offers a comprehensive solution to these issues. By employing federated learning (FL), FedGODE enables Roadside-Units (local clients) to contribute to the model training process, addressing challenges of localized traffic patterns and ensuring a more accurate representation of diverse scenarios. FedGODE incorporates privacy-preserving mechanisms (local differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and secure aggregation), mitigating privacy concerns. FedGODE facilitates real-time updates to the global model, ensuring adaptability to dynamic traffic conditions while reducing network inefficiencies by transmitting only model updates. FedGODE utilizes (average/median) aggregation methods to aggregate the client's local updates. The performance of FedGODE was evaluated using six real-world traffic flow datasets and compared against nine baselines (ARIMA, VAR, FC-LSTM, STGCN, DCRNN, ASTGCN, Graph WaveNet, STG2seq, STGODE, and FedGRU). The results showed that FedGODE outperforms all baselines for short-and-long-term prediction.

The results showed that the lignin removal ratio of 1-butyl-3-lethylimidazolyl chloride/ethylenediamine (IL/EDA) system could reach 96.05 % under the pretreatment condition of 200℃ for 2 h, and the yield of Levoglucosan obtained from pyrolysis bio-oil reached 169.70 mg·g−1 with high selectivity. Moreover, IL/EDA pretreatment increased the nitrogen content of lignin and hemicellulose, enhanced the fluorescence intensity, and effectively realized selective detection and information encryption. Furthermore, Density functional theory (DFT) calculation proved that the addition of organic solvents was beneficial to the reaction between lignin and ethylenediamine (EDA).

In particular, we propose performing the exhaustive evaluation of a subset of variables stepwise, that is, by incrementing the size of such subset each time that an evaluation leads to a polynomial system which is possibly unfeasible to solve. The decision about which evaluation to extend is based on a preprocessing consisting in computing an incomplete Gröbner basis after the current evaluation, which possibly generates linear polynomials that are used to eliminate further variables. If the number of remaining variables in the system is deemed still too high, the evaluation is extended and the preprocessing is iterated. Otherwise, we solve the system by a complete Gröbner basis computation. Having in mind cryptanalytic applications, we present an implementation of this strategy in an algorithm called MULTISOLVE which is designed for polynomial systems having at most one solution. We prove explicit formulas for its complexity which are based on probability distributions that can be easily estimated by performing the proposed preprocessing on a testset of evaluations for different subsets of variables. We prove that an optimal complexity of MULTISOLVE is achieved by using a full multistep strategy with a maximum number of steps and in turn the standard guess-and-determine strategy, which essentially is a strategy consisting of a single step, is the worst choice. Finally, we extensively study the behaviour of MULTISOLVE when performing an algebraic attack on the well-known stream cipher TRIVIUM. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

This emerging paradigm has the potential to revolutionize various fields such as cryptography, chemistry, and finance, making it a highly relevant area of research and development. Major companies such as Google, Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft, along with prestigious research institutions such as Oxford and MIT, are investing significant efforts into advancing this technology. However, the lack of a standardized approach among different providers poses challenges for developers to effectively access and utilize quantum computing resources. In this study, we propose a quantum orchestrator that is designed to facilitate the orchestration and execution of quantum circuits across multiple quantum service providers. The proposed solution aims to simplify the process for developers and facilitate the execution of quantum tasks using resources offered by different providers. The proposal is validated with the implementation of the proposed orchestrator for Amazon Braket and IBM Quantum.

Accordingly, BKW, Gauss algorithm, and their improved or hybrid variants have been proposed to solve the LPN problem. In this paper, we propose an intelligent method for LPN solving from a wholly new perspective by iterative correcting the secret, which can successfully reduce the dimension of the LPN problem. While the challenge is that there are so many independent secret variables of the given checking parity equations with noise in LPN problems, a set of rules should be developed to effectively direct and correct the secret. To solve this problem, we skillfully introduce the genetic algorithm to simulate the process of iterative correction and further add vaccination technology to guide and speed up the iterative process. Owing to the small memory and data consumption of our algorithm, we conducted experiments and, for the first time, solved the largest practical LPN(256,1/8) instance in 30 days, which shows the superiority of our method.

Herein, a facile palette strategy based on physical doping of red afterglow-emitted chromophore (N8) into sodium alginate (SA) is proposed to achieve large range of multicolor afterglow modulation for single conventional chromophore-based RTP materials. As well as being a key luminous component in the color palette, SA with cyan afterglow (upon 254 nm UV irradiation) can also activate the red afterglow of N8 via strong hydrogen bond interactions. Through regulating the doping ratios of N8 to SA, cyan to red afterglows have been achieved in the formed amorphous N8/SA films. Significantly, the afterglow of N8/SA also exhibits excitation wavelength- and time-dependent characteristics, which further extend the range and tunability of afterglow color. Besides, the phosphorescence lifetime of N8-based SA films could be further improved by chemically grafting N8 to SA, with a lifetime of 464.9 ms. Considering the excellent multicolor afterglow tunability and hygrothermal responsiveness, these smart SA-based materials demonstrate great application prospects in information encryption, anti-counterfeit ink painting, and 3D afterglow aerogel. © 2024"

To prevent users from disclosing their access permissions, traceable CP-ABE schemes are emerging. However, the current traceable CP-ABE schemes still have some security problems, such as impromptu attribute retracting, unreliable tracking, and easy disclosure of access policy privacy, making it essential to implement dynamic data security sharing and malicious user auditing. To address these issues, we propose an auditable and dynamic access control scheme with behavior and identity tracing. The scheme first uses an access tree with hidden leaf nodes to express the access policy, improving the flexibility and security of access control. Secondly, the Blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) frameworks perform the audit authentication and store the ciphertext, policy, and public keys to avoid tampering with shared data. Furthermore, to prevent users from leaking their decryption keys, a tracing algorithm based on white-box traceability is developed. On this basis, an authority update algorithm is proposed to revoke the malicious user's permission immediately and update the decrypted key for unrevoked users. An auditable smart contract based on blockchain is proposed to prevent user denial. Finally, theoretical analyses prove that the proposed scheme not only achieves traceability, revocation, authority updating, policy hiding, and audit, but also guarantees security under a chosen plaintext attack model. Experiments demonstrate that our proposal reduces the key generation time by 22.6%, the encryption and decryption time by 39.2% and 59.8%, and the storage costs of ciphertext and private key are reduced by 12.1% and 5.6% over existing schemes. © 2024 The Author(s)"

HySSA has two stages of operation. Patients are fitted with proximity sensor nodes (PSNs), which establish a wireless personal area network (WBAN) in the first phase of the procedure. It is up to the nodes to decide which cluster head (CH) in their vicinity can send data to the WBAN's Gateway sensor nodes (GSN) containing EHR meta-data. Second, GSN implements a lightweight signcryption technique for authorized stakeholders that combines data encryption and signing in the second phase of its development. An interplanetary file system provides secure keys for access to the data, which is exchanged over open channels (IPFS). Data mining results are stored to lower computing expenses, and block ledgers are used in global chain architectures. Compared to other schemes, the proposed HySSA scheme is cheaper for transaction and signing expense parameters, throughput of transactions, and computational and communication expenses. It takes HySSA a standard of 3.32 s (s) to sign and 6.52 s (s) to verify in simulation. It takes 3.325 s to mine 200 blocks, compared to 7.8 s for traditional schemes. The throughput of transactions was 142.78 Mbps, as opposed to the standard 102.45 Mbps.

Likewise, human identification and authentication before accessing the devices, the machines involved in the network also need authentication to eliminate the risk of anomaly. The existing works provided the means for device authentication but failed to focus on the personalized authentication of devices based on their security requirements. The zero-trust network has many devices, and each device before becoming a network member and gaining access to the network needs to be verified. It is a time-consuming process to verify each device and sometimes the same security policy does not meet the security requirements of all the devices. The proposed paper highlighted an approach where each device authenticity is measured individually depending on the associated device security requirements and the profile of the device. The underlying scheme breaks into different phases: making blocks of the device data and assigning hash values to each block to uniquely identify a particular block containing associated device data. Next, each device data is encrypted using the key and then decrypted by the intended receptor holding the key to obtain the original data to ensure the device data's confidentiality and integrity. After that, the profiling of the device is maintained based on the personalized authentication being performed to analyze the access level and the security of the requirements of the devices in the network.

In this work, we focus on the security aspect, particularly the confidentiality and access control of the data (for instance EMR) during transmission and later after the data is stored in the cloud. However, Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) is considered the most convenient for the accomplishment of fine access control. In fact, the current CP-ABE solutions are not efficient and suitable for use in the context of IoTs, as things that usually the data producers are very constrained and thus cannot perform the public-key cryptographic functions used by CP-ABE.

IoT devices can include everyday objects such as televisions, cars and shoes. The interconnectedness brought forth by IoT has extended the need for cybersecurity beyond the information security realm into the physical security sphere. However, ensuring cybersecurity of IoT devices is far from straightforward because IoT devices have several cybersecurity challenges associated with them. Some of the pertinent cybersecurity challenges of IoT devices in this regard relate to: (i) Security During Manufacturing, (ii) Identification and Authentication, (iii) Lack of Encryption, (iv) Large Attack Surface, (v) Security During Updates, (vi) Lack of User Awareness and (vii) Diverging Standards and Regulations. Against this background, the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) has been proposed to complement the existing EU cybersecurity framework consisting of legislations such as the Cybersecurity Act and the NIS2 Directive. However, does the CRA provide a framework for effectively combating the cybersecurity challenges of IoT devices in the EU? The central crux of the CRA is to lay down and enforce the rules required to ensure cybersecurity of ‘products with digital elements’, which includes IoT devices. To this end, several obligations are imposed on manufacturers, importers and distributors of IoT devices. Manufacturers are mandated to ensure that the essential cybersecurity requirements prescribed by the CRA are met before placing IoT devices in the market. While the cybersecurity requirements mandated by the CRA are commendable, the CRA suffers from several ambiguities which can hamper its potential impact. For instance, the CRA could provide guidance to manufacturers on how to conduct cybersecurity risk assessment and could clarify the meanings of terms such as “limit attack surfaces” and “without any known exploitable vulnerabilities”. When the fundamental themes of the CRA is analysed from the prism of the cybersecurity challenges of IoT devices, it becomes clear that the CRA does provide a foundation for effectively addressing the cybersecurity challenges of IoT devices. However, the expansive wording in various parts of the CRA, including in the Annex I Requirements, leaves scope for interpretation on several fronts. Consequently, the effectiveness of the CRA in tackling the Security During Manufacturing Challenge, Identification and Authentication Challenge, Large Attack Surface Challenge and Diverging Standards and Regulations Challenge would be largely contingent on how harmonised standards develop and how the industry adopts them. The CRA seems to be more effective, albeit not fully so, in significantly addressing the Lack of Encryption Challenge, Security During Updates Challenge and Lack of User Awareness Challenge of IoT devices. However, the manner in which the CRA addresses all these cybersecurity challenges could be improved upon if an agency such as the ENISA was given the legal mandate to set elaborate standards for cybersecurity requirements under the CRA. © 2024 The Author"

To address users' diverse attitudes towards data sharing and their varied usage requirements, this paper introduces an adaptive privacy protection framework for user energy data based on dictionary learning and watermarking techniques. Central to this framework is an innovative digital watermark anonymization method designed to meet the dual objectives of encryption and anonymous data sharing. This method employs sparse dictionary decomposition to embed confidential user information within sparse coefficients, significantly enhancing computational efficiency while minimally impacting the integrity of the original data. Additionally, through sparse data representation, the framework achieves effective data compression, addressing the challenges of extensive storage requirements inherent in maintaining original energy consumption data, encryption results, and the data sharing process. Security analysis and case studies demonstrate the proposed method's robustness against eavesdropping, unauthorized access, and other security threats. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, the flourishing of FL still encounters significant challenges, particularly in the realms of data security and information privacy. In recent years, plenty of privacy-preserving FL schemes have been proposed, yet few of them support global model confidentiality protection for the training server. In this paper, by combining Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and homomorphic encryption, we propose a TEE-assisted federated logistic regression training scheme with model confidentiality protection, named TFLR. Specifically, we first formalize a cryptography-TEE hybrid security model under the multi-party cooperative computation scenario. Subsequently, within this hybrid security model, we design a series of secure computation protocols with semi-honest TEE to execute non-linear operations while maintaining the encryption form of global model parameters. Therefore, the global model of the training server can be well protected. In addition, TFLR incorporates a double masking technique, further fortifying the privacy of data owners' local updates. Detailed security analysis shows that TFLR is able to protect all sensitive information of data owners and the training server. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of TFLR with real machine learning datasets, and the results substantiate that TFLR is indeed efficient. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Traditional encryption algorithms designed for text data might not be efficient for handling the bulk data of audio files, leading to slow processing times and increased storage requirements. Striking the right balance between robust encryption and efficient processing is crucial. Additionally, some encryption methods can introduce noise or artifacts into the audio signal, impacting its clarity. Maintaining high-fidelity audio quality while ensuring strong encryption remains an ongoing area of research. Despite these challenges, the need for secure audio communication is undeniable. The RCM chaotic map is used to introduce chaotic properties in the encryption framework. A novel pseudorandom bit generator approach is proposed and used for encryption purposes. The proposed work is a symmetric encryption approach and is completely lossless. The proposed approach uses some lightweight computational procedures that make the algorithm simple and computationally less expensive which makes it suitable for real-time applications. Furthermore, the proposed approach shows significant performance and resilience against various cryptographic attacks. A new scrambling algorithm is proposed to add a layer of security. The proposed scramble algorithm uses logistic map beside the RCM map. The proposed approach achieved 98.28 % NSCR value and 33.63 % UACI values on average. The experimental outcomes are encouraging for practical applications of the proposed approach. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, achieving long-lifetime phosphorescence with color-tunable RTP CDs is a huge challenge. In this work, precursor molecules with different degrees of conjugation: 4-ethoxycarbonyl phenylboronic acid (4-EpBA), 9-phenanthracenylboronic acid (9-PhBA) and 1-pyrenylboronic acid (1-PyBA) were combined with urea and ammonium pentaborate (AP) matrix through high temperature pyrolysis method, long-lifetime and colorful phosphorescent CDs composites of 4-EpBA@Urea, 9-PhBA@Urea and 1-PyBA@AP were successfully synthesized. As the degree of conjugation of the precursor molecules increased, the phosphorescence colors of 4-EpBA@Urea, 9-PhBA@Urea and 1-PyBA@AP were blue, green and orange, respectively. In addition, since 1-PyBA@Urea could not produce orange phosphorescence emission, we chose 1-PyBA@AP that was able to generate bright orange phosphorescence after UV excitation. Furthermore, the rationality behind phosphorescence emission mechanism and wavelength modulation is further conformed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Although MP-PSI has many practical applications, none of the existing MP-PSI protocols are quantum-proof security. Compared to classical and post-quantum cryptography, quantum cryptography, which relies on quantum mechanics, can provide a superior solution to resist various quantum attacks and achieve quantum-proof security. In this paper, we propose a multi-party quantum private set intersection (MP-QPSI) protocol, which can compute the set intersection with one protocol execution. The proposed protocol can not only keep the private sets undisclosed to the participants and third party (TP), but also prevent external attacks from outsider eavesdroppers. It utilizes easy-to-implement technologies such as single photons, single-particle measurements, and rotation operations. To validate the feasibility of the proposed protocol, a quantum circuit for the simulation experiment is designed and executed on IBM Quantum Experience.

Herein, we fabricate two naphthalimide (NA)-functionalized spiropyran (SP) photoswitch molecular materials containing intramolecular energy donor-acceptor combinations (SP–N1, SP-N2), which have the adjustable multimodality fluorescence emissions and gradient photochromism. The intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer within the excited states can be realized via designing the proximal distance between spiropyran and naphthalimide chromophore groups and their structure conversion, whereby the multimodality fluorescence emission can be generated. The color and intensity of fluorescence emissions are regulated by designing energy donor and acceptor system. The detailed spectroscopic and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) studies demonstrate that the effective photoconversion between SP-NA and the corresponding open structure merocyanine (MC) isomers (MC-NA) is facilitated by the large free volume induced by the rigid conjugation planes of the molecules. The PET composite films containing functional molecules have adjustable multimodal fluorescence emissions and variable photoinduced color. They are applied in multi-level anti-counterfeiting, and the patterns with the multi-signal output mode greatly enhance the level of anti-counterfeiting.

VHC-CIES introduces a Hill cipher variant and three improved one-dimensional chaotic maps to enhance the security. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive cryptanalysis, and find that VHC-CIES can resist neither chosen-plaintext attack nor chosen-ciphertext attack due to its inherent flaws. When it comes to chosen-plaintext attack, firstly, we select a plaintext with the pixel values are all 0 and its corresponding ciphertext, and then use algebraic analysis to obtain the equivalent key stream for cracking VHC-CIES. Secondly, we select a plaintext which the pixel values are invariably 1 and obtain its corresponding ciphertext to obtain some Hill cipher variant parameters of VHC-CIES. Finally, we use the resulting steps of the first two to recover the original plain image from a given target cipher image. Similarly, a chosen-ciphertext attack method can also break VHC-CIES. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that both chosen-plaintext attack and chosen-ciphertext attack can effectively crack VHC-CIES with data complexity of only O(2). For color images of size 256×256×3, when our simulation encryption time is 0.3150 s, the time for complete breaking by chosen-plaintext attack and chosen-ciphertext attack is about 0.6020 s and 0.9643 s, respectively. To improve its security, some suggestions for further improvement are also given.

This study proposes a secure framework for protecting cloud-based educational systems from hacking using a unique encryption technique, as well as a deep learning-based classification for cloud attack detection. Initially, we preprocess the data and extract features using a gray-level covariance matrix (GLCM). Next, we propose a classification based on multiple convolutional neural networks (M−CNN) to detect attacks in the cloud environment. Finally, we propose a modified digital signature algorithm (MDSA) for data encryption and decryption. The proposed technique achieved high security rates, with an accuracy of 97.7%, sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 94.3%, precision of 99.6%, and recall of 97%.

With proper design, it has the potential to become an excellent room temperature phosphorescent (RTP) material. In this study, we present a straightforward and adaptable approach for linking arylboronic acid chromophores to cellulose chains via B─O covalent bonds in pure water, leading to multicolor RTP cellulose. By increasing the conjugation of the chromophores, the emission color of RTP can be adjusted from blue-green to red. Cellulose promotes the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect of the arylboronic acid groups and enhance the intersystem crossing (ISC) process. The rigid environment formed by B─O covalent and hydrogen bonds stabilizes the triplet excitons and suppresses the nonradiative leaps, which results in excellent RTP performance with a lifetime of 1.85 s and an afterglow of up to 18 s. It is important to note that the formation of various emissive species results in excitation-dependent persistent luminescence in the RTP cellulose system. Therefore, given the exceptional sustainability of cellulose materials, RTP cellulose films have tremendous potential in applications such as persistent luminescence displays, dual-mode information encryption, and advanced anti-counterfeiting. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Therefore, it is particularly important to study the public key authenticated keyword searchable encryption (PEAKS) scheme which can resist quantum. This scheme can provide double guarantee for the data in cloud storage: one is to ensure the confidentiality of the data, so that the original content cannot be decrypted even within the cloud service provider; the other is to allow users to perform keyword searches on encrypted data without decrypting the data. This provides a balance of security and efficiency for data search and analysis in cloud computing environment. Recently, Genise et al. designed a Gadget-based iNTRU trapdoor, which has the advantages of small size and high efficiency. Therefore, we design an efficient and secure public key authentication keyword searchable encryption scheme based on iNTRU lattice. The overall running time of this scheme is only more than 300ms. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Therefore, safeguarding these networks against security threats is paramount to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data transmitted within them. However, WITSNs face escalating security threats due to their diverse structures and platforms. Existing literature has identified these vulnerabilities but lacks comprehensive solutions to address them effectively. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel security approach termed Randomized Bi-Phase Authentication Scheme (RBAS), which integrates digital watermarking techniques to fortify both external and internal network security. RBAS not only tackles data availability, confidentiality, and authenticity challenges prevalent in WITSNs but also strives to maintain a delicate equilibrium between robust security measures and energy efficiency. Key contributions of this work include the meticulous examination and validation of the integration of cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes in IoT sensor network authentication, demonstrating their efficacy in error detection through simulations. Furthermore, RBAS employs advanced hashing, cryptography, and dynamic verification codes to ensure strong error detection and data authenticity, leveraging robust CRC codes and randomization to thwart potential attacks. The scheme's complexity acts as a deterrent against manipulation, while its cluster awareness enhances adaptability, and cryptographic principles bolster overall security. Extensive performance evaluation using the Network Simulator-2 (NS2) reveals significant benefits of RBAS, including an 8 % reduction in power consumption and a 7 % increase in network longevity. Notably, RBAS surpasses existing solutions with a 14 % reduction in dropping ratio and an 8 % decrease in latency. The success of RBAS stems from its innovative utilization of lightweight watermarking techniques and cluster-based routing, enabling proactive identification of data tampering and thereby enhancing the network's overall security posture. This pioneering work not only advances the state of the art in WITSN security but also holds profound implications for the practical deployment of secure and efficient IoT sensor networks in real-world scenarios. © 2024 The Author(s)"

To handle this problem, we propose a trust and encryption-based SRP based on trust modelling with intrusion detection, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), clustering, fuzzy rules and ant colony optimization (ACO)-oriented SRP for WSN routing. In this paper, an extended convolutional neural networks with Schrodinger equation and particle swarm optimization is proposed for developing and intrusion detection-based trust modelling. Moreover, a new node authentication scheme and an encryption-based secure routing protocol are also proposed in this work for increasing the security. This proposed secure protocol known as trust and ECC encryption-based ACO-SRP (TECC-ACO-SRP) performs authentication and trust analysis on the nodes using intrusion detection, and then, the data are communicated after data encryption using ECC encryption technique. This proposed system combines dominant set clustering with fuzzy rules to make clusters with similar type of nodes as members and then selects cluster heads (CHs) for every cluster.

Previously, we have reported D-xylose crystals has an obvious λex-dependent color tunable persistent room temperature phosphorescence (p-RTP) from blue to green, but its p-RTP emission at long wavelength is very weak. To further explore this attractive multicolor p-RTP behavior, and to enhance its tunability, the photoluminescence (PL) behavior of three common cyclodextrins (CDs), namely α-CD, β-CD and γ-CD, including solution and single crystals, were studied. Their single crystals demonstrate λex-dependent multicolor p-RTP properties in the order of β-CD>α γ-CD>γ α-CD, rather than the strongest with the least glucose units (γ α-CD). Among them, the λex-dependent tunable p-RTP of β-CD and α-CD is superior to that of D-(+)-xylose single crystal. The above unexpected phenomena could be explained reasonably through detailed single crystal structure analysis and theoretical calculations. The emission behavior of solution and single crystals of CDs can be reasonably explained by the clustering-triggered emission (CTE) mechanism. Furthermore, CD-based covalent organic frameworks (COF) and supramolecules are readily fabricated, which own significantly enhanced p-RTP emission. Due to the intriguing PL property as well as hydrophilic rim and low biotoxicity of CDs, successful imaging of HCT116 cells and encryption applications were demonstrated. It is believed that the intrinsic PL properties of CDs, especially their regularly adjustable multicolor p-RTP that varies with the number of glucose units, have significant guidance for the development of a series of multicolor luminescent materials. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The circuit can be modeled in the voltage–current domain and flux–charge domain respectively. From the flux–charge domain, it is noted that by the introduction of periodic forces, the number and type of AC equilibrium points in the circuit system changes with time, facilitating more complex dynamic behaviors. From the voltage–current domain, numerous numerical simulation methods are employed to investigate the dynamic behaviors of the circuit system, such as phase diagrams, bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, and 2-dimensional basins of attraction. The non-autonomous circuit system can give birth to multiple dynamic behaviors as the voltage source, component parameters, and the memristor's initial state value changes. It can exhibit periodic cycles, chaos, hyperchaos, infinite coexisting attractors, extreme multistability, transient dynamics, and offset boosting behavior. Moreover, Hamilton energy function and its derivative are utilized to analyze of the dynamic characteristics for nondimensional system corresponding to the non-autonomous circuit, from the perspective of energy dissipation and generation. Additionally, the circuit implementation through Multisim validates the findings of the theoretical analysis.

However, the previous schemes cannot provide satisfactory compression performance. In this article, a cipher-image coding scheme based on 2D compressive sensing (2DCS) and cipher-domain mapping (CDM) is proposed to address this concern. Before image compression, the 2D image is encrypted by the scrambling operation to protect privacy. Then, with the aid of auxiliary information (AI), the ciphertext image is mapped by CDM to facilitate cipher-image compression. Thirdly, the mapped ciphertext image is compressed by using 2DCS. Finally, the mapped CS measurements are encoded into bits. Since CDM operation can make the amplitude scale of CS measurements smaller, the mapped CS measurements can be encoded with fewer bits than the raw CS measurements. Simulation results show that this work achieves better compression performance than the previous CS-based works. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

While there is a heated discussion about regulating the access primitive to end-user devices for law enforcement, little attention is given to the technical design of how evidence should be collected. This is especially critical during remote surveillance, as law enforcement may have unrestricted access to end-user devices over longer periods of time. In this paper, we propose the novel category of key extraction-based lawful interception (KEX-LI), meaning that instead of directly accessing plaintext data, law enforcement only extracts the necessary key material from end-user devices, thus minimizing the requirements of data extraction on end-user devices. When subsequently collecting encrypted data (e.g., via wiretapping), law enforcement can use these keys for decryption. We structure and survey the state-of-the-art of key extraction techniques, thus embedding KEX-LI in the broader context of device forensics. Furthermore, we describe specific requirements for a practical solution to conduct KEX-LI and evaluate currently available technical implementations. Our results are intended to help practitioners select the most suitable techniques as well as to identify research gaps. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Based on this, we propose the Rew-LSTM classification model for experiments on publicly available datasets of encrypted traffic, and the results show that excellent results can be obtained when using only the data in packet headers for multiple classification, especially when the data is represented using bit, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

An accurate traffic classification is crucial for improving network service quality, optimizing network operations, and ensuring information security. However, most of the existing neural network-based methods lack attention to key information and have insufficient traffic feature extraction capability. Motivated by the above limitations, we proposed a novel and effective end-to-end model based on channel attention and deformable convolution, called CAD-Net. Specifically, a novel channel attention mechanism and a powerful deformable convolution technique are introduced in the residual network, which provides the model with the capability of focusing on the most relevant features and capturing the implicit features among the traffic bytes. Furthermore, our class-aware weighted cross-entropy loss function significantly improves the performance of CAD-Net under class-imbalanced conditions. We comprehensively evaluated the effectiveness of CAD-Net on two public datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieved the best performance compared with existing methods on both encrypted traffic service and application classification tasks. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

In this paper, the authors generalize the MSST algorithm of characteristic 2 to general fields of odd characteristic, and propose the generalized MSST algorithm. The generalized MSST algorithm is achieved by combining the advantages of the SST algorithm and the generalized AGM algorithm. If the time complexity of the multiplication of two n-bit numbers is denoted as O(nμ), then the time complexity of the generalized MSST algorithm is O(n2μ+11+μ), which is the same as the improved SST algorithm.

Moreover, its intrinsic properties as well as various dynamic behaviors are both demonstrated through theoretical analysis and two-parameter Lyapunov exponential charts. Secondly, guided by a multi-objective loss function and a known prior distribution, the original medical image is encrypted into a noise-like cipher image through the proposed encryption scheme.

The ensuing privacy leakage events have aroused widespread concerns. Therefore, image sharing that protects privacy is desired. Progressive Secret Image Sharing (PSIS), a multilevel privacy protection technology for images, offers a promising solution. However, the progressivity of the majority of PSIS schemes depends on the preprocessing of a secret image, which increases the calculation costs. In addition, a block-based PSIS may have information leakage security risks when processing highly confidential images. Many existing PSIS schemes use a single operation to share secret images, which makes the schemes inflexible and limits the application scenarios. Therefore, we propose a PSIS based on Boolean operations and Polynomial interpolations (PSIS-BP). The proposed scheme divides the bit-plane of the pixel into two parts. One part is utilized to perform the Boolean operation, and the other part is used to perform the polynomial interpolation. Different assignment strategies can produce different progressive reconstruction levels and expand the application scenarios of the scheme.

They gather information from the live environment and some send it over networks. These devices may range in size from one cubic millimetre to a credit card size. When deploying in real-time, there are numerous obstacles to overcome, including those related to processing power, wireless capability, interoperability, and security. When billions of smart devices make a connected network in a diverse set of platforms, especially when shifting from the server world to sensors, it gives birth to various unprecedented challenges for their owners or users. These challenges constitute safety, durability, & privacy, interoperability, and technologies. In this paper, the need for secure data communication for low processing power devices is presented and a new lightweight block cipher cryptographic technique called RLCA (Robust Lightweight Cryptographic Algorithm) uses a combination of linear and non-linear mathematical techniques. Choosing the PRESENT algorithm as a benchmark, a comparative analysis based on the time taken to encrypt and decrypt for different data sizes is carried out. The experimental results have shown an improvement of 97% in execution time as compared with the standard PRESENT algorithm. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

However, in order to establish a common phase frame between the sender and receiver, a low power phase reference needs to be transmitted with quantum signals, which may bring in new security problems for eavesdroppers to obtain information illegally. Especially in trusted phase noise model, phase noise associated with detectors is regarded as trusted noise in order to obtain a higher secret key rate and transmission distance, which further provides opportunities for eavesdroppers. To this end, we propose an optical attenuator-oriented attack strategy against the LLO-CVQKD system under the trusted phase noise model, where Eve can inject suitable light into the optical attenuator in reference light path to reduce the attenuation level of it, thereby controlling the intensity of the reference pulses and resulting in an underestimated excess noise. Simulation results show that the proposed attack strategy can render the estimated secret key rate much higher than the actual values. When the transmission distance exceeds 25 km, the eavesdropper can obtain approximately 90% of the key information by adjusting the intensity of the reference pulses to twice the original value. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd."

Specifically, the optimized measurement matrix is firstly generated by chaotic system and singular value decomposition (SVD), and the optimized measurement matrix is used to obtain the measurement value matrix by STP-CS operation on the color image. Next, the reorganized measurement value matrix is scrambled and diffused with the key matrix generated by 2D Logistic-Sine-coupling map (2D-LSCM) to obtain the noise-like encrypted image. Finally, an image embedding method is introduced to embed the compressed noise-like encrypted image into a color or grayscale carrier image to obtain a visually secure color or grayscale encrypted image. SHA-256 is used to generate the initial values of chaotic systems, which are embedded into the carrier image to effectively reduce transmission and storage.

The security and integrity of medical images have become of utmost importance due to the growing dependence on digital imaging technologies. Zero-watermarking is a technique used in digital image processing where the watermark is not embedded into the medical image instead, a key is generated for security purposes to achieve the information process. In the context of medical images, preserving visual fidelity and diagnostic accuracy is of utmost importance, making zero-watermarking an attractive approach for safeguarding sensitive healthcare data. This paper proposes a zero-watermarking system that utilizes the Frensnelet Transform and Spiking Cortical Model (FT-SCM) for extracting image features and enhancing the system's resilience against various attacks. The proposed system uses FT-SCM techniques to generate a perceptual hash of size 1 × 64. The proposed cryptosystem is used to encrypt the watermark for better security. Later, the encrypted watermark and perceptual hash are merged to create a zero-watermark image (key). The proposed system yields an average PSNR, SSIM, and NC values of 57.07 dB, 0.99, and 0.75, respectively, which demonstrates an improved performance from the state-of-the-art zero-watermarking approaches. Also, the proposed cryptosystem is analysed and compared using security metrics. Security assessments demonstrate the proposed image cryptosystem approach's efficiency, security, and realizability because of key generation in the confusion and diffusion process, which gives a chaotic nature compared to state-of-the-art approaches encryption methods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, maintaining high visual transparency simultaneously is a challenging task, but it holds vital importance for applications such as smart windows and multispectral information encryption. Here, we designed and fabricated a multilayer film based on thermochromic material vanadium dioxide (VO2) with high transmittance (62.1 %) in visible region and excellent emissivity regulation (0.3) in mid-infrared region. Besides, quantities of energy saving simulations among 85 administrative districts in the United States and China and outdoor tests in Shanghai were done to verify the performance in different climates for the application of energy saving smart window. Furthermore, by taking advantage of its high transmittance in visible band and emissivity tunability in mid-infrared band, VO2-based multilayer film has demonstrated the enormous potential application for information encryption through a proof-of-concept validation.

By implementing rotation encryption, the practicality of quantum SMC_XOR protocol can be significantly improved without other complex quantum techniques. Security analysis shows that the proposed protocol can resist various types of attacks. Furthermore, a special network model is designed to solve this issue, using hash function to verify the identity of the communication parties and key recycling to reduce resource consumption.

Since high-resolution (HR) MR images contribute to the clinic diagnosis, reconstructing HR MR images from these under-sampled data is pretty important. Recently, deep learning (DL) methods for HR reconstruction of MR images have achieved impressive performance. However, it is difficult to collect enough data for training DL models in practice due to medical data privacy regulations. Fortunately, federated learning (FL) is proposed to eliminate this issue by local/distributed training and encryption. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale channel attention network (MSCAN) for MR image super-resolution (SR) and integrate it into an FL framework named FedAve to make use of data from multiple institutions and avoid privacy risk. Specifically, to utilize multi-scale information in MR images, we introduce a multi-scale feature block (MSFB), in which multi-scale features are extracted and attention among features at different scales is captured to re-weight these multi-scale features. Then, a spatial gradient profile loss is integrated into MSCAN to facilitate the recovery of textures in MR images. Last, we incorporate MSCAN into FedAve to simulate the scenery of collaborated training among multiple institutions. Ablation studies show the effectiveness of the multi-scale features, the multi-scale channel attention, and the texture loss. Comparative experiments with some state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods indicate that the proposed MSCAN is superior to the compared methods and the model with FL has close results to the one trained by centralized data. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Images are one of the most widely shared data, and chaotic ciphers arouse significant interest from researchers, as traditional ciphers are not optimized for image encryption. Chaotic encryption schemes perform well for low-quality images but should be faster for real-time encryption of Full Ultra HD images. In this context, a novel parallel image cipher scheme is proposed to execute in GPU architectures, where the encryption procedure consists of a single kernel, making it different from previous chaotic ciphers and the AES. This new contribution enables our work to achieve a throughput of 130.8 GB/s on a GeForce RTX3070 and 251.6 GB/s on a Tesla V100 GPU, an increase of 37% compared to the AES and 43 times higher than the previously high for chaotic ciphers.

Secondly, the generalized ∞-norm and 1-norm are introduced to induce the global exponential stability for CLVMNNs, and two special Lyapunov functionals are established to prove the stability.

Compound 1: 0.5 %Sb3+ displays green broadband emission with photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 44.4 %, while compound 2: 1 %Sb3+ produces yellow emission with PLQY of 73.46 %. A reversible transition between green and orange light emission for 1: 0.5 %Sb3+ can be triggered by thermal stimulation; such photoluminescence (PL) color switching happens with a fast response time of 20 s and a low transition temperature of 333 K. In addition, the materials combining compounds 2: 1 %Sb3+ and 1: 0.5 %Sb3+ can achieve complex digital encryption and decryption upon heating. Furthermore, due to its excellent luminous efficiency, the 2: 1 %Sb3+ is employed as yellow phosphor for white light-emitting diode (WLED). The WLED shows a CRI of 90.5 and a CCT of 5415 K, superior to most WLEDs based on hybrid metal halides. Finally, the impact of forming the self-trapped excitons state and complex PL mechanism of compound 1: 0.5 %Sb3+ are investigated through DFT calculations and femtosecond transient absorption techniques.

For realizing the copyright protection of color image in 5G environment, a spatial digital watermarking scheme for dual color image fusing Hadamard transform is proposed in this paper. In this scheme, the protected color cover image is firstly channeled and then divided into 4 × 4 non-overlapping image blocks. Then, the maximum energy coefficient of image block in the Hadamard domain is acquired directly in the spatial domain, and the watermark information is hidden by quantizing this coefficient. Finally, the changed quantization variation of the special coefficient are evenly distributed to each coefficient of the original spatial image block, so as to realize the complete process of hiding the watermark. In the extraction stage, only the special coefficient of the watermarked image in the Hadamard domain is obtained in the spatial domain, and the coefficient threshold is analyzed to determine the coding of watermark information. This scheme combines the characteristics of spatial domain algorithm and frequency domain algorithm, and designs a set of high security encryption method, at the same time, considers the human vision system to color sensitivity and the correlation of color image channel. Compared with other schemes, it can be found that this scheme has excellent security and real-time performance, strong robustness to common attacks, and high image quality. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, it is still challenging to realize the afterglow properties of CNMs, such as the effective realization of afterglow and stable afterglow properties. In this work, we processed boric acid (BA) with N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to form a matrix by microwave, modified the CNMs produced by benzene-1,3.5-tricarboxylic acid (BTA) and tetraethylenepentamlne (TEPA) in two steps, and successfully prepared CNMs with yellow or green afterglow characteristic. The rotational freedom of the first-step material is limited by the formation of a BA-MDF matrix, which effectively suppresses the nonradiative transition and triple exciton deactivation, and the presence of a rigid structure limits the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and promotes the energy levels to jump to the triple state to realize the afterglow properties.

Edge-based IoMT devices like smart wearables and implantables often acquire PHRs. Cloud computing plays a vital role in handling computing and storage tasks for edge-based IoMT devices. However, concerns about trust with cloud servers require the use of encryption, which may complicate the retrieval of encrypted PHRs from the cloud. This paper presents certificateless public key encryption with plaintext-checkable encryption (CL-PKE-PCE). CL-PKE-PCE enables searching for encrypted data using plaintext keywords while eliminating key escrow and certificate management issues. The CL-PKE-PCE scheme facilitates the verification of ciphertexts against plaintexts without the need for decryption, thereby maintaining data privacy. Furthermore, the security of the proposed CL-PKE-PCE scheme has been substantiated under the bilinear Diffie–Hellman assumption. Compared to similar work, it efficiently lowers calculation costs for encryption, decryption, and search algorithms by 63.66%, 51.17%, and 61.62%, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the CL-PKE-PCE is simultaneously secure and efficient, affirming its suitability for edge-based IoMT scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

In this paper, an n-dimensional(n-D) polynomial modulo chaotic map (nD-PMCM) is proposed as a general model, whose range of Lyapunov exponent is controlled by the system parameters and the robust chaotic behavior with the desired complexity can be obtained. And an instantiated 2D-PMCM is constructed by setting the corresponding parameters in nD-PMCM, which exhibits superior chaotic performance compared to other chaotic maps. Then a novel color image encryption scheme based on the 2D-PMCM is also constructed, which mainly uses cross-plane cyclic shift permutation and cross-plane XOR diffusion. Different from the traditional encryption scheme with separate processing of color planes, the cross-plane operation disrupts the correlation between color image planes and has higher encryption efficiency due to the ability to disrupt the pixel position while also changing the pixel value. The experimental simulation results show that this encryption scheme has better security and encryption effects. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

This paper details on the dynamical appraisal, amplitude controls, microcontroller execution, Random number generator (RNG) of an autonomous three-dimensional (3D) oscillator with two and four wings attractors (ATDOTFWA), and its image encryption application. Thanks to the Routh-Hurwitz criteria, five steady states found in the ATDOTFWA are classified as stable or unstable, depending on its two control parameters. During the numerical simulations employing the Runge-Kutta scheme, the ATDOTFWA exhibit a wide range of dynamic behaviors, including no oscillations, Hopf bifurcation, limit cycle, five distinct presentations of two wings chaotic structures, monostable and bistable two wings chaotic structures, bistable and monostable regular oscillations, chaotic bursting characteristics, coexistence of period-2-oscillations and four wings chaotic structure, and four wings chaotic attractor which were validated experimentally by the microcontroller implementation. The total and partial controls of the amplitude are achieved in the ATDOTFWA. A RNG is designed based on the ATDOTFWA, and the generated random numbers are successfully tested using the ENT and NIST 800-22 statistical test suites, demonstrating the reliability of the ATDOTFWA-based RNG. This reliability is further confirmed through the application of the ATDOTFWA-based RNG in an efficient and secure image encryption process, where the generated random numbers are used as the encryption key. The effectiveness of the image encryption process is validated through comprehensive cryptanalysis, with an encryption time of 0.1923 s for a 512×512 image, an average normalized pixel change rate (NPCR) of 99.6126%, an average unified average changing intensity (UACI) of 33.4578%, and an average information entropy of 7.9994. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd."

The trade-off between diffusion property and area is a widely studied issue in the design of low-energy block ciphers. In this paper, a low-energy lightweight block cipher named as GFLE is presented. The core cipher of GFLE uses a variant of the Generalized Feistel Structure (GFS) with 4-branch, which combines the Type-II GFS with the simplified Lai-Massey. The DRmax of GFLE has a one-round improvement over the Type-II GFS optimized by Suzaki et al and the security margin is achieved in a shorter number of rounds. Moreover, an S-box with low-energy and good cryptographic properties is proposed by searching combinations based on gate-level circuits using a depth-first strategy. It exhibits better security properties and hardware performance compared to other S-boxes. The block cipher GFLE is implemented in ASIC with UMC 0.18 μm. It has been proved that the energy of GFLE is lower than Midori, WARP, SKINNY, CRAFT, etc in unified encryption and decryption (ED) circuits. GFLE reduces energy by 61.59% compared with SKINNY. The results show that GFLE in ED circuits consumes only 1596 Gate Equivalents (GEs) and 6.36 μ J/bit in area and energy, respectively. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd."

However, most of the existing image encryption algorithms only focus on the security of images in the transmission and storage process, while ignoring their security in use. For some special organisations, images are very sensitive information and their security during usage is also very important. Similar to the advanced encryption information stored in the public security system, the depth of information that can be viewed by ordinary privileges and advanced privileges is different. But there is no such hierarchical authorisation algorithm in image security. In order to solve this problem, this study proposes a hierarchical authorisation encryption and decryption algorithm, which achieves hierarchical decryption while ensuring the security of encrypted images. In this method, the image is decomposed by bit plane, and the bit plane is grouped, and each group adopts different key. According to the level of legitimate users, the corresponding key is assigned to them, and the clarity of the decrypted image requested by different levels of users is different, that is, the information depth is different. This method extends the scope of application of the encryption algorithm and is more practical than the existing encryption algorithm. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd."

A quantum adversary generates a quantum state as a pirate software that potentially removes an embedded message from a classical marked software. Extracting an embedded message from quantum pirate software is difficult since measurement could irreversibly alter the quantum state. In software watermarking against classical adversaries, a message extraction algorithm crucially uses the (input–output) behavior of a classical pirate software to extract an embedded message. Even if we instantiate existing watermarking PRFs with quantum-safe building blocks, it is not clear whether they are secure against quantum adversaries due to the quantum-specific property above. Thus, we need entirely new techniques to achieve software watermarking against quantum adversaries. In this work, we define secure watermarking PRFs and PKE for quantum adversaries (unremovability against quantum adversaries). We also present two watermarking PRFs and one watermarking PKE as follows. We construct a privately extractable watermarking PRF against quantum adversaries from the quantum hardness of the learning with errors (LWE) problem. The marking and extraction algorithms use a public parameter and a private extraction key, respectively. The watermarking PRF is unremovable even if adversaries have (the public parameter and) access to the extraction oracle, which returns a result of extraction for a queried quantum circuit. We construct a publicly extractable watermarking PRF against quantum adversaries from indistinguishability obfuscation and the quantum hardness of the LWE problem. The marking and extraction algorithms use a public parameter and a public extraction key, respectively. The watermarking PRF is unremovable even if adversaries have the extraction key (and the public parameter). We construct a publicly extractable watermarking PKE against quantum adversaries from standard PKE. The marking algorithm can directly generate a marked decryption from a decryption key, and the extraction algorithm uses a public key of the PKE scheme for extraction. We develop a quantum extraction technique to extract information (a classical string) from a quantum state without destroying the state too much. We also introduce the notions of extraction-less watermarking PRFs and PKE as crucial building blocks to achieve the results above by combining the tool with our quantum extraction technique. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2024."

Therefore, we propose TRA-PS, an accountable data Pub/Sub service that implements efficient revocation, traceability, and public auditability for subscriptions. Technically, we refine the secret key of subscriber in the classic ABKS schemes with associating its identity information and binding accountability module. In addition, we implement TRA-PS and evaluate its practical performance compared to state-of-the-art work in the real cloud environment. Besides achieving accountable property, TRA-PS significantly diminishes the decryption time cost (number of attributes/keywords is 25) by 91.8%, independent of the number of attributes/keywords. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The novelty lies in KBHC and variable-length bit scrambling. KBHC possesses non-preset, balanced, and key-controlled characteristics, providing the proposed algorithm with high capacity and enhanced security. The non-preset allows coding tables to be adaptively generated based on prediction error maps, resulting in shorter encoded streams for higher embedding capacity. The balanced characteristic is achieved by adjusting the subtrees, so that the balance rate in the encoded stream is 0.014, and can also reach 0.065 for particularly smooth images, achieving uniform distribution of the encoded stream, thereby improving the ability to resist statistical analysis attacks. The random key controls the leaf nodes scrambling in the Huffman tree, which realizes the variability of the encoded stream and avoids the potential security risks caused by timestamp reconstruction, laying the foundation to achieve differential attack security. Variable-length bit scrambling determines the pseudo-random extension length and scrambling sequence by both the encryption key and coding table information, effectively resists brute force attacks and ensures up to 100 % difference rate between scrambling sequences generated in each run. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to several RDH-EI methods, the proposed algorithm achieves higher embedding capacity and security under acceptable complexity. The average embedding rate of three databases reaches 3.897 bpp, and the proposed algorithm effectively resists statistical analysis attacks, COA, KPA, and differential attack. © 2024"

Traditional methods, notably deep packet inspection, have encountered challenges due to the rise in encrypted traffic, diminishing their efficacy. In response, machine learning approaches, including decision trees, have been adopted for their ability to classify flows without necessitating access to the payload, thereby enhancing classification efficiency. Nonetheless, these machine learning-based models introduce considerable overhead in category determination. To address this issue, this paper introduces a locality-sensitive flow classification (LSFC) method, leveraging locality-sensitive hashing to efficiently partition and group traffic, thereby expediting the classification process and minimizing overhead. LSFC adeptly balances classification accuracy and processing delay, catering to the specific demands of various scenarios. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that LSFC significantly outperforms traditional machine learning models in inference speed by over 50% and improves upon deep packet inspection techniques in handling encrypted traffic, achieving a reduction in classification delay exceeding 15% without compromising classification accuracy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Nevertheless, the application scenarios of these polymers are rather limited owing to the lack of functional groups. Herein, sulfur atoms are incorporated into the microstructures of long-chain aliphatic polyesters to decipher the variations of physicochemical properties upon replacing specific methylene units by thioether moieties and simultaneously impart polyethylene-like materials with functionalities. First of all, high molecular weight polyesters P1-P4 and poly(β-thioester)s P5-P8 were obtained via condensation polymerization and thiol-Michael polyaddition, respectively. As for phase transition behaviors, poly(β-thioester)s show inferior crystallization/melting temperatures and the corresponding enthalpy changes than their polyester counterparts, and a loosely packed crystalline structure should be responsible for such thermal property degradation. It is reasonable that replacing specific methylene units of long-chain aliphatic polyesters by sulfur atoms, the much bulkier functional entities, will definitely cause great disturbance to the regular arrangement of polymer chains. The rapid hydrolytic degradation of poly(β-thioester)s in acidic and alkaline media can be ascribed to the easy penetration of water molecules into their incompact amorphous/crystalline regions. In the meantime, these poly(β-thioester)s exhibit great prospects in noble metal recovery and information encryption (optical anticounterfeiting). For instance, poly(β-thioester) P5 is an excellent adsorbent to abstract gold ions from water due to its outstanding metal coordination capability. Moreover, poly(β-thioester) P5 emits bright blue photoluminescence in concentrated solution and solid state upon UV irradiation as a result of the clustering-triggered through space electron delocalization and rigidified polymer chain conformation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, attackers always abuse traffic encryption to conceal malicious behaviors. Although researchers have proposed several enlightening detection methods, they must enhance the generalization ability or improve detection performance. Our inspiration is that the packet header fields, as do the underlying grammatical rules for constructing sentences, have a strict order. We consider the original packet as text and devise a robust approach with natural language processing and a deep learning model to improve the generalization ability and detection performance. We capture the critical keywords as characteristic representations of the traffic and design an adaptive domain generalization algorithm with a new loss function. It is robust against various datasets by generating more malicious samples to augment the minority of malicious samples. Simultaneously, we design an efficient feature selection algorithm, which obtains an optimal feature subset and reduces feature dimensions by 75.3%. To evaluate our work, we conducted extensive experiments with open-source datasets (CICIDS 2017, CICDDoS 2019, and USTC-TFC 2016), the synthetic dataset from IoT-23, and Internet backbone traffic (CERNET). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposal improves detection accuracy by up to 22.8% compared to others not using domain generalization algorithms and achieves an average detection latency of 0.67 s in the backbone.

First, to address security concerns arising from the limited performance of the current chaotic system, a new 3D-CCM is presented with a designed three-dimensional coupled map using Logistic map and Iterative chaotic map (3D-LICM). In addition, a novel key acquisition model is also developed to generate pseudo-random keystream. Next, the secret plain images are reorganized into three matrices of the same size together with the keystream. Then, the proposed algorithm implements cross-plane confusion, 3D Zigzag confusion-diffusion and cross-plane diffusion to achieve encryption for the former three matrices, resulting in a cipher image. Finally, execute a 3D-DCT transformation on a color carrier image, followed by an embedding operation of the cipher image into DCT coefficients, resulting in a carrier image containing secrets, i.e., visually meaningful cipher image. Fortunately, the proposed multi-image encryption can address the issue of requiring multiple rounds of encryption to different images. Different from noise-like cipher image, the proposed MiEHA has a better capability of encrypting and hiding secret images, with a high visual effect for carrier image before and after being embedded. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024."

To protect this data, securing it during storage and transmission is essential, allowing only the data producer and final consumer to access or modify it. This can be particularly challenging for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices, which often have limited processing and memory capabilities. To address these challenges, End-to-End (E2E) security mechanisms are needed to prevent data breaches resulting from value chain attacks. Additionally, value chain environments are dynamic and involve multiple data generation and consumption entities, requiring the ability to update access policies as needed. This paper presents a Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) data exchange system that provides E2E security for value chains, considering the most relevant security and industrial requirements. The proposed solution can protect data according to access policies while also allowing those policies to be updated without breaking E2E security or overloading field devices.

In this work, we proposed a crosstalk-free MIE scheme based on computational ghost imaging (CGI) with binarized detection. In the encryption process, the plaintext images are encrypted into intensity sequences by the CGI system and quantified into two levels to obtain binary ciphertext sequences, which does not cause severe degradation in decrypted image quality compared to traditional CGI. Then, for the binary ciphertext sequences, we can combine them into a decimal grayscale ciphertext. To enhance security, a pixel bit layer scrambling (PBLS) algorithm is designed to scramble the grayscale ciphertext to obtain the final ciphertext. In the decryption process, anyone of the plaintext images can be decrypted without being affected by other plaintext images after performing inverse PBLS algorithm on the ciphertext and extracting the binary ciphertext sequence. The effectiveness, robustness, encryption capacity and security of the proposed scheme are demonstrated by numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. © 2024 Astro Ltd."

For these constructions, we are able to accurately predict the number of degree fall polynomials produced in a Gröbner basis attack, up to and including degree 5 for the Dob encryption scheme and four for C∗. The predictions remain accurate even when fixing variables.

In this context, the focus of cybersecurity in IoT involves the deployment of diverse technologies, standards, and optimum practices including, but not limited to, encryption, firewalls, and multi-factor authentication. Hence, while IoT contributes significantly to societal advancement, addressing the associated security concerns remains an imperative task. This study therefore delves into an examination of flood attacks, a prevalent form of cyber assault aimed at IoT devices. The study explored the ramifications of such an attack on an IoT system by analyzing network traffic in scenarios of singular and multiple attackers. A benchmark model devoid of an attack was employed for comparative purposes. To circumvent additional stress on the operational system, network packets were mirrored through cloud infrastructure and subsequently relayed to artificial intelligence (AI) and forensic analysis tools for real-time examination. To assure the integral cybersecurity component of continuity within IoT systems, the attacking entities were identified through AI, and forensic tools were employed to conduct real-time data analysis, thereby enabling continuous network monitoring. This study introduces an innovative approach to detecting flood attacks on IoT systems by leveraging a novel AI-based technique that integrates the ’6LoWPAN.Pattern’ feature, previously unexplored in this context. Extensive simulations were conducted to analyze the impact of flood attacks using both single and multiple-attacker scenarios.

Through detailed dynamical analysis and verification, the excellent chaotic properties of this map have been proven. Based on this system, an improved lightweight unmanned surface vehicle (USV) image information encryption system is designed. Given the constraints of USV equipment, the system first compresses images to enhance their storage capacity and transmission efficiency. Subsequently, an enhanced lightweight Feistel network encryption method is developed, utilizing a diagonal interpolation permutation model to ensure the security of the encryption process and reduce its complexity through a block structure. Simulation experiments and data analysis demonstrate that this algorithm effectively ensures the security of image information within the USV system. The use of compressed sensing and a block encryption structure reduces the complexity of the encryption process, thereby enhancing both the encryption efficiency and the transmission efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Accurate monitoring of emissions in these enterprises is crucial for ensuring fair and trusted carbon trading. However, traditional monitoring methods have encountered various challenges including poor accuracy, low frequency, significant hysteresis and weak credibility. Addressing these concerns, this paper introduces a novel, multi-trusted, high-frequency monitoring approach for the measurement of both direct and indirect carbon emissions of enterprises, utilizing externally available multi-source big data, vertical federated long short-term memory network with a self-attention mechanism (VF-LSTMSA) and additive homomorphic encryption. The efficacy of this model is thoroughly assessed via case studies on six hourly datasets from the power and steel sectors. Our principal findings include: (1) In the current scenario, the proposed VF-LSTMSA model demonstrates superior federated efficiency, improving with the inclusion of more federated participants. (2) The VF-LSTMSA model surpasses other prevalent AI models, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of less than 9% across power and steel datasets. (3) The advanced high-frequency carbon emission monitoring method exhibits errors of +0.28%, +1.29%, and −0.41% in the current scenario monitoring task, suggesting that the model effectively leverages multi-source externally available big data to precisely monitor the target enterprise's carbon emissions while safeguarding multi-party data security.

The average size of ZMGGO:Cr3+ nanoparticles minishes from 59 to 12 nm with growing Mg2+ concentration. Meanwhile their luminescence intensity at 696 nm of ZMGGO:Cr3+ nanoparticles was only decreased by less than half of that of the undoped nanoparticles due to the decreased particle size after Mg doping. Meanwhile, the integral luminescence intensity of their entire emission band shows an increasing trend with increasing temperature due to the enhanced phonon sideband luminescence at high temperature. More important, it is found that the formation energies associated with Mg′Ga-GaoZn and Zn′Ga-GaoZn defects are −1.2 and 1.69 eV, respectively, suggesting the enhanced afterglow intensity of ZMGGO:Cr3+ can be ascribed to Mg doping leading to the increased number of these anti-site traps.

However, the technology is faced with challenges related to user privacy, resource management, handover authentication, and security of the air interface and internet channels. Moreover, the use of specialized base stations such as wireless Access Points (AP) and Road-Side Units (RSU) in vehicular communications may be owned by subscribers outside formal network operators. The conventional handover authentication schemes have a lengthy latency period that conflicts with the 5G quality of service. To tackle these challenges, this paper presents an anonymous scheme that utilizes Blockchain and Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) to ensure efficient privacy in the handover protocol of 5G Networks. The proposed scheme has been thoroughly evaluated for security and privacy and has shown to be resistant to identity catching, location area tracing, and replay attacks while achieving Forward/Backward secrecy. Furthermore, the performance evaluation of the proposed scheme indicates that it is efficient and speedy as it involves a limited number of messages, low computation, and does not necessitate the involvement of the Home Network (HN) in the authentication or handover protocols. A diligently crafted BAHO authentication protocol, following cryptographic principles, guarantees robust security against the Real-or-Random model.

With the evolution of quantum computers, there is a growing need to develop the 3PAKE protocols that can resist the quantum attacks. Hence, various 3PAKE protocols have been proposed based on the famous Ring Learning With Error (RLWE) problem. But we find out that all these protocols are vulnerable to signal leakage attacks if their public/private keys are reused. Also, the design of these protocols are pretty complex, thus making these protocols highly inefficient. Hence, to overcome the above issues, we have proposed Simple Lattice-based 3PAKE (SL3PAKE), which is simple in its design and resists signal leakage attack if its public/private keys are reused. The order and flow of messages in the proposed SL3PAKE protocol is quite natural without added complexity, thus makes it simple 3PAKE protocol.

In today's Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), hiding countermeasure has earned the limelight for its “shufflability” in lattice-based, and code-based, cryptographic algorithms. In this narrative, most importantly, as a rule, fast generation of permutations is paramount to both efficacy and security of an algorithm. The Fisher–Yates (FY) shuffling method has long been a popular choice for this purpose: the FY method generates randomly shuffled (finite) indices. However, despite its theoretical verity, with the FY method we anticipate the following risks of misuse, which can lead to biased shuffling sequences: (i) incorrect implementation, (ii) poor random source, and (iii) the chosen random number being too small. In this paper, we introduce a new statistical test called “approximate permutation criterion” (“APC”). We use it to examine some known cases of misused FY shuffling (i–iii). APC takes into consideration the fact that the super-exponential rate of growth of the factorial function N!, which represents the number of permutations of N indices, defies any meaningful form of statistical tests. With APC one can verify whether the output permutations are biased or not with much lower testing cost. Mathematically, in this paper we introduce the so-called “kth order permutation verification”, the underpinning notion upon which APC is based. We also compare APC with full sample space to demonstrate how well it encapsulates the statistical randomness of random permutations. We thereby provide a new method that identifies a bias that exists in the output permutations when implementing FY Shuffling through a visual ratio test and the chi-square (χ2) distribution test. © 2024 The Author(s)"

However, these hydrogels are susceptible to water losses when exposed to air, leading to structural damage, significantly shortened service lives, and compromised durability. This study presents mechanically robust, environmentally stable, and multi-stimuli responsive optical organohydrogel fibers with customizable iridescent colors. These fibers are fabricated by incorporating tunicate cellulose nanocrystals, alginate, and acrylamide in a glycerol-water binary system. The synthesized fibers exhibit high strength (1.38 MPa), moisture retention capabilities, and elastic properties. Furthermore, a sensor based on these fibers demonstrates high- and low-temperature resistance along with stimuli-responsive characteristics, effectively detecting changes in environmental humidity and strains. Moreover, the fiber sensor demonstrates continuous, repeatable, and quantitatively predictable moisture discoloration responses across a humidity range of 11 % and 98 %. During strain sensing, the optical-organohydrogel-based sensor demonstrates a large working strain (50 %) and excellent cycling stability, underscoring its potential for effectively monitoring a wide range of intricate human motions.

Here, an efficient broadband NIR phosphor Mg4Nb2O9:Cr3+ was achieved.

To further broaden the NIR emission, Yb3+ was co-doped with Cr3+ in Mg4Nb2O9.

Motivated by the concepts of the intelligent system and quantitative detection, we develop a smartphone-assisted cascade visual sensing device based on nitrogen-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) for in-site quantitative detection of morin and aluminium ion (Al3+). Initially, citric acid and o-phenylenediamine are identified as precursors for N-CDs synthesis via the microwave-assisted hydrothermal treatment. Subsequently, systematic studies reveal that the fluorescence of N-CDs is quenched upon the introduction of morin because of the inner filter effect (IFE). Conversely, the fluorescence recovery phenomenon occurs after the cascade addition of Al3+ since the morin binds with Al3+, resulting in the inhibition of IFE. Simultaneously, the fluorescence recovery of N-CDs enhances the cyan fluorescence emission of morin/Al3+. Based on the fluorescence quenching and recovery behavior, morin and Al3+ can be detected in the ranges of 0.070–50 μM and 0.124–40 μM with low detection limits of 0.070 μM and 0.124 μM, respectively. Furtherly, a smartphone-assisted cascade visual sensing device is designed for in-site quantitative detection of morin and Al3+. Moreover, based on the strong fluorescence and concentration-dependent emission behavior of N-CDs, the multi-color fluorescent ink is developed successfully. This work not only offers an excellent solution for simultaneous detection of morin and Al3+ but also shows numerous opportunities for solid lighting, information encryption and flexible optics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The information to be encrypted and shared is converted into a QR code. For supporting the multi-channel encryption, a 1-nw encryption algorithm is employed, which possesses the capability to map the original image information into nw seemingly random cipher images. In terms of hardware, an ultra-compact optical encryption device is designed, which consists of two rows of ring resonators coupled to the waveguide. This novel encryption device can output ten cipher images, each transmitted on a separate channel. Meanwhile, the vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser subject to optical injection and optical feedback is researched to generate optical chaos sequences, which are introduced for key generation and QR code encryption. Ultimately, combining the 1-nw encryption algorithm and optical chaos, information protection is implemented based on integrated optics. The simulation results demonstrate the practical feasibility and remarkable effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Furthermore, various security and robustness analyses are performed, and the results reveal that the proposed information protection scheme has a high level of security and robustness.

Due to the huge volume of big data, users generally upload data to the cloud for storage and computation. Because data in the cloud is beyond the control of users, it faces threats such as data security and personal privacy leakage. To address these concerns and achieve big data security and privacy protection in clouds, data encryption is crucial. Traditional public key encryption involves complex certificate management in a public key infrastructure (PKI). Although the identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme avoids the management of public key certificates, it has issues with key escrows and identity revocation. The certificateless public key encryption (CL-PKE) not only solves the key escrows problem in IBE, but also maintains its advantage of not requiring the use of certificate in PKI, making it suitable for the security protection of big data in clouds. However, most CL-PKE schemes are constructed based on large integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems, which cannot resist quantum computing attacks. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient lattice-based CL-PKE scheme for big data security in clouds. In addition, the proposed scheme is extended to a lattice-based certificateless proxy re-encryption scheme, facilitating secure big data sharing in clouds. The proposed CL-PKE scheme can resist attacks from both internal and external adversaries, and has been proven to be IND-CPA secure under the learning with errors (LWE) assumption. Experiments have shown that the proposed CL-PKE scheme has lower computational and communication costs. The proposed lattice-based schemes can effectively provide post quantum security for the security and privacy protection of big data in clouds. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Researchers have developed various text-hiding methods to address this need, but these methods often suffer from limitations such as low embedding capacity or high embedding distortion. However, current methods for information hiding require a large image database or have a low capacity for hiding information, which makes them impractical. To address these issues, we propose a coverless information-hiding method that generates anime characters through generative adversarial networks (GANs). This method converts secret information into an attribute label set for anime characters and uses the label set to generate anime characters directly. The quality of the generated anime characters was improved by the super-resolution GAN (SRGAN) model. The resulting images were used to communicate secret information on the digital channel. Numerous experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, including hiding capacity, image clarity, robustness and security. Results showed that the proposed framework outperforms existing text-hiding methods in terms of hiding capacity and robustness while maintaining image clarity and computation time. In conclusion, our proposed framework provides a secure and efficient solution for text encryption and decryption in feasible computation time using anime characters generated by a GAN. The framework has a high embedding capacity and low embedding distortion, making it a promising solution for secure communication in the digital world. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

This problem is widely used in encryption, planning or scheduling, and integer partitions. An accurate search algorithm with polynomial time complexity has not been found, which makes it challenging to be solved on classical computers. To effectively solve this problem, we translate it into the quantum Ising model and solve it with a variational quantum optimization method based on conditional values at risk. The proposed model needs only n qubits to encode 2n dimensional search space, which can effectively save the encoding quantum resources. The model inherits the advantages of variational quantum algorithms and can obtain good performance at shallow circuit depths while being robust to noise, and it is convenient to be deployed in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum era. We investigate the effects of the scalability, the variational ansatz type, the variational depth, and noise on the model. Moreover, we also discuss the performance of the model under different conditional values at risk. Through computer simulation, the scale can reach more than nine qubits. By selecting the noise type, we construct simulators with different QVs and study the performance of the model with them. In addition, we deploy the model on a superconducting quantum computer of the Origin Quantum Technology Company and successfully solve the subset sum problem.

We can access our bank accounts or make an appointment with our doctor anytime and anywhere. To achieve this, we have to share certain information, whether personal, professional, etc. This may seem like a minor cost for an individual user, but actually the data economy as the backbone of a digital transformation that is reshaping all aspects of human life. However, one of the major concerns arises regarding what happens to such individual data; once shared, control over it is often lost. For that reason, users and companies are reluctant to share their data. The European Union, through its European Strategy for Data, is establishing a policy and legal framework for establishing a single market for data in Europe by improving the trust and fairness of the data economy. Data spaces are a commitment to sharing data in a reliable and secure way, but this endeavour should, of course, not be at the expense of privacy rights. In recent years, Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) have emerged to achieve data sharing and privacy preservation that can address the requirements of data spaces around sensitive citizen and business data. In this work, we review existing PETs and assess their relevance, technological maturity, and applicability in the context of common European data spaces. Finally, we illustrate the benefits of secure data sharing via Federated Learning in a healthcare use case, where the preservation of privacy is a primer requirement and is therefore to be guaranteed. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Such remarkable characteristics are poised to further advance the practical application of quantum communication networks. In this paper, MP-QKD is extended to the scenario of multi-user communication networks. MP-QKD enables concurrent operation across multiple channels by integrating wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology, facilitating secure communication among multiple users. The performance of MP-QKD in multi-channel concurrent operation is analyzed through simulating various experimental conditions. The asymmetric MP-QKD case is also considered and pulse intensity optimization improves performance for asymmetric network channels.

However, the spatiotemporal modulation of circularly polarized luminescence materials by using light irradiation is still challenging. Herein, we have constructed a kind of hybrid supramolecular nanofibers with tunable circularly polarized luminescence based on photoresponsive chiral cinnamic acid gelator and achiral spiropyran through photoisomerization. The chiral cinnamic acid gelator could self-assemble into nanofiber structures by hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction and π-π stacking, displaying intense right-handed circularly polarized luminescence at 400 nm. However, UV irradiation causes the trans–cis isomerization of the cinnamic acid moiety, resulting in the transformation of nanofibers into rod-like structures and the loss of circularly polarized luminescence signal. In view of this problem, we discovered that the photoisomerized spiropyran can help with the photostability of the nanofibers as well as tuning of their CPL emission, as spiropyran molecule could be transformed into its merocyanine state by ring-opening reaction under 254 nm UV irradiation following with the formation of chiral merocyanine aggregates on the surfaces of the nanofibers. The as-obtained hybrid nanofibers emit both right-handed circularly polarized luminescence at 400 nm and left-handed circularly polarized luminescence at 700 nm with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor. The present study provides a new hybrid strategy to control the photostability as well as regulate the circularly polarized luminescence performance of soft materials.

However, a key limitation of ND is its inability to analyze as many rounds as the classical differential distinguisher (CD). To overcome this, researchers have begun combining ND with CD into a classical-neural distinguisher (CND) for differential cryptanalysis. Nevertheless, the optimal integration of CD and ND remains an under-studied and unresolved challenge. In this paper, we introduce a superior approach for constructing the (r+s)-round differential distinguisher CNDr+s by keeping the r-round classical distinguisher CDr and the s-round neural distinguisher NDs in balance. Through experimental analysis, we find that the data complexity of CNDr+s closely approximates the product of that for CDr and NDs. This finding highlights the limitations of current strategies. Subsequently, we introduce an enhanced scheme for constructing CNDr+s, which comprises three main components: a new method for searching the suitable differential characteristics, a scheme for constructing the neural distinguisher, and an accelerated evaluation strategy for the data complexity of CNDr+s. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to the round-reduced Simon32, Speck32 and Present64, achieving improved results. Specifically, for Simon32, our CND12 and CND13 exhibit data complexities of 216 and 221, respectively, whereas CND12 in prior work required a data complexity of 222. In the case of Speck32, Our scheme reduce the data complexity of CND9 form 220 to 218. For Present64, We construct CND8 with a data complexity of 213, a significant improvement over the classical distinguisher of 232. These results demonstrate the superiority of our scheme. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Some of this data may be highly sensitive and important and CSPs cannot always be trusted to provide secure access. It is also important for end users to protect their identities against malicious authorities and providers, when they access services and data. Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is an end-to-end public key encryption mechanism, which provides secure and reliable fine-grained access control over encrypted data using defined policies and constraints. Since, in ABE, users are identified by their attributes and not by their identities, collecting and analyzing attributes may reveal their identities and violate their anonymity. Towards this end, we define a new anonymity model in the context of ABE. We analyze several existing anonymous ABE schemes and identify their vulnerabilities in user authorization and user anonymity protection. Subsequently, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Access Control Scheme (PACS), which supports multi-authority, anonymizes user identity, and is immune against users collusion attacks, authorities collusion attacks and chosen plaintext attacks. We also propose an extension of PACS, called Statistical Privacy-Preserving Access Control Scheme (SPACS), which supports statistical anonymity even if malicious authorities and providers statistically analyze the attributes. Lastly, we show that the efficiency of our scheme is comparable to other existing schemes. Our analysis show that SPACS can successfully protect against Collision Attacks and Chosen Plaintext Attacks. © 2024"

In order to perform confusion process over the channels, they are flattened to produce bit-tapes and then confusion process is done.

However, the existing studies focus on the coordinated scheduling of CSP and wind energy, overlooking the critical issue of energy pricing and trading. Moreover, a decentralized model for multiple networks that incorporate both CSP and wind generators, remains under-investigated. Accordingly, this paper proposes a fully decentralized distributionally robust transactive energy management (DRTM) framework for the energy trading, pricing and scheduling across multiple integrated wind-concentrated solar virtual power plants (IWC-VPP), using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). This model allows each IWC-VPP operator to make independent decisions and share minimal information, ensuring privacy encryption. Based on the distributionally robust optimization (DRO), the DRTM framework can balance robustness and cost-effectiveness in making decisions under uncertainties. For efficient resolution, an adaptive buffer-column and constraint generation (AB-C&CG) algorithm is introduced, which reduces the complexity of the master problem compared to the traditional C&CG. Additionally, a varying penalty factor technique is integrated into ADMM to accelerate computation, and a two-block process is implemented to ensure finite convergence of the entire decentralized framework. Numerical studies on the three-VPP 25-Bus system and four-VPP 156-Bus system validate the effectiveness of the proposed DRTM framework. The simulation results demonstrate the varying penalty factor technique bolsters computational efficiency by up to 46.51% for standard ADMM. Compared with the conventional C&CG, the AB-C&CG significantly reduces the computational consumption by 50.98%, and with the error <0.46%. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Chaos theory is used for the development of deterministic nonlinear systems, that can be used to create random numbers for the Chaotic Logistic Map (CLM) based encryption. This study describes a cryptographic algorithm for encrypting ECG signals that uses a mix of the CLM and fingerprint data. The common factor between the patient section and monitoring section is the operation on sample data points of ECG. The choice of proper encryption and decryption theme can save more amount of time and is invulnerable both to noisebased attacks and hacking instances. The proposed framework is implemented on Dropbox based cloud storage and access is possible from any given locations.

However, the existing studies suffer from low disordering capability, poor dynamic performance, and lack of sensitivity of the chaotic maps. In order to address these limitations, a Cross-Channel Color IE (CCC-IE) algorithm is presented, which has high shuffling ability with diagonal permutation and bi-directional sequential diffusion through a novel 2D hyperchaotic hybrid map of optimization test functions. The proposed 2D hyperchaotic map, namely 2D-RG map, is designed by hybridizing the Rastrigin and Griewank functions. Their chaotic nature, such as high complexity and fluctuation, makes them suitable for design of chaotic map. The 2D-RG map-based CCC-IE algorithm diagonally scrambles the pixels of the image across RGB channels and sequentially manipulates the pixel values in bi-direction for improving resistance of the algorithm to the cyberthreats. The dynamic performance of the 2D-RG map and the reliability of the CCC-IE algorithm are separately investigated and validated through a detailed comparison with the state of the art.

However, conventional methods for detecting DNS traffic are no longer effective in identifying encrypted traffic, particularly with the utilization of the DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) protocol, which employs secure HTTPS for DNS resolution. To confront this challenge, we propose a novel model for detecting malicious DoH traffic, named DoH-TriCGAN, which distinguishes between non-DoH, benign DoH, and malicious DoH traffic. DoH-TriCGAN employs a conditional generative adversarial network comprising three network components, for which we only provide additional information to the generator. We extracted different small sample datasets and large sample dataset from the CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw-2020 dataset, to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed DoH-TriCGAN model, and compared the quality of the generated synthetic data. To establish a benchmark, we utilized the six metrics – accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC_AUC, and PR_AUC – to assess the performance of our model. The results demonstrate our proposed model outperforms the other five models (RF, XGBoost, BiGRU, Autoencoder, Transformer), showing the best performance particularly in scenarios with limited training samples, while also demonstrating data expansion capabilities by generating high-quality synthetic data to address the issue of insufficient network traffic. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Whereas invariants of the entire S-box layer have been studied in terms of the corresponding cycle structure, a similar analysis for the linear layer has not been performed yet. In this article, we provide a theoretical analysis for specifying the minimal length of cycles for commonly used linear permutations in lightweight block ciphers. Namely, using a suitable matrix representation, we exactly specify the minimal cycle lengths for those linear layers that employ ShiftRows, Rotational-XOR and circular Boolean matrix operations which can be found in many well-known families of block ciphers. These results are practically useful for the purpose of finding nonlinear invariants of the entire encryption rounds since these can be specified using the intersection of cycles corresponding to the linear and S-box layer. We also apply our theoretical analysis practically and specify minimal cycle lengths of linear layers for certain families of block ciphers including some NIST candidates. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Hinting PRGs enable many cryptographic applications, most notably CCA-secure public-key encryption and trapdoor functions. In this paper, we study cryptographic primitives with the hinting property, yielding the following results: We present a novel and conceptually simpler approach for designing hinting PRGs from certain decisional assumptions over cyclic groups or isogeny-based group actions, which enables simpler security proofs as compared to the existing approaches for designing such primitives. We also show that the same design approach yields a generic construction of hinting PRGs from a simple cryptographic primitive with algebraic structure, namely a key-homomorphic weak PRF. We introduce hinting pseudorandom functions (PRFs) and hinting weak PRFs, which are natural extensions of the hinting property to PRFs and weak PRFs. We show how to realize circular/KDM-secure symmetric-key encryption from any hinting weak PRF. We demonstrate that our simple approach for building hinting PRGs can be extended to realize hinting weak PRFs from the same set of decisional assumptions. We also show a generic construction of hinting (weak) PRF from any hinting PRG with certain structural properties, thus yielding the first constructions of symmetric-key encryption with full-fledged circular/KDM-security from such hinting PRGs. We propose a stronger version of the hinting property, which we call the functional hinting property, that guarantees security even in the presence of hints about functions of the secret seed/key. We show how to instantiate functional hinting PRGs/weak PRFs for certain (families of) functions by building upon our simple techniques for realizing plain hinting PRGs/weak PRFs. We also demonstrate the applicability of a functional hinting weak PRF with certain algebraic properties in realizing KDM-secure public-key encryption in a black-box manner. We show the first black-box separation between hinting PRFs (and hence, hinting PRGs) from public-key encryption using simple realizations of these primitives given only a random oracle. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2024."

However, most systems involving CPL are within the visible range; near-infrared (NIR) CPL-active materials, especially those that exhibit high glum values and can be controlled spatially and temporally, are rare. Herein, dynamic NIR-CPL with a glum value of 2.5×10−2 was achieved through supramolecular coassembly and energy-transfer strategies. The chiral assemblies formed by the coassembly between adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and a pyrene derivative exhibited a red CPL signal (glum of 10−3). The further introduction of sulfo-cyanine5 resulted in a energy-transfer process, which not only led to the NIR CPL but also increased the glum value to 10−2. Temporal control of these chiral assemblies was realized by introducing alkaline phosphatase to fabricate a biomimetic enzyme-catalyzed network, allowing the dynamic NIR CPL signal to be turned on. Based on these enzyme-regulated temporally controllable dynamic CPL-active chiral assemblies, a multilevel information encryption system was further developed. This study provides a pioneering example for the construction of dynamic NIR CPL materials with the ability to perform temporal control via the supramolecular assembly strategy, which is expected to aid in the design of supramolecular complex systems that more closely resemble natural biological systems. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

However, most invisible inks cannot be instantly erased, posing an information leak risk. Here, a novel TPE-derived AIE fluorescent molecule (TPE-PA) was synthesized, and its potential for perpetual erasure in formulating security ink was examined. In the EtOH/water co-solvent with water fraction (fw) of 70 %, the fluorescence of TPE-PA was almost entirely quenched after 30 min of UV light irradiation, attributed to the photocyclization and subsequent photo-oxidation of TPE derivatives caused by the irreversible photoquenching. Such a trait was used to craft invisible ink containing 0.2 mM TPE-PA dissolved in the mixture of EtOH and water with fw of 70 %, and applied to the wine bottles for fluorescence anti-counterfeiting verification. It was found the fluorescence patterns drawn with the ink can be permanently erased upon UV irradiation. These findings offer a guideline for creating novel erasable invisible inks and show potential in anti-counterfeiting. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, the existing multi-pixel TPE scheme has poor temporal performance, and the 2-pixel TPE scheme requires multiple encryptions to ensure the confidentiality of the image.

It ensures data sharing between the data owner and the data accessor without revealing the owner’s private key. Moreover, it utilizes a quantum hash function based on controlled alternate quantum walks to compute quantum hash value. The obtained hash value has higher randomness, collision resistance and input sensitivity. Additionally, this method combines on-chain and off-chain storage.

To address this issue, this research proposes a novel triple-image encryption method tailored for IIoT applications. Unlike conventional algorithms processing a single grayscale image to produce a corresponding single ciphertext, the proposed approach generates a single color encrypted image corresponding to three grayscale input images. This complexity adds an extra layer of challenge for unauthorized individuals attempting to recover plaintext data. Leveraging the 3-D non-equilateral Arnold transform (NEAT), extended one-dimensional chaotic jumping (1DCJ), and a four-dimensional hyperchaotic Chen map of fractional order (4DHCFO), the proposed method begins by processing three grayscale images—Rgray, Ggray, and Bgray—with a 3-D NEAT to scramble their pixel positions. Employing three distinct scrambling operations, multilayer permutation, multiround permutation, and diagonal permutation, enhances scrambling complexity. Subsequently, binary bit planes are extracted and subjected to bit-level scrambling via 1DCJ. Further, a 4DHCFO generates a 16 × 16 substitution box for diffusing scrambled bit planes using XOR operations.

Ineffective resource management can reduce the cloud computing performance. Consequently, it is imperative to distribute resources fairly among various stakeholders while maintaining the organizations profitability and user satisfaction levels. It is not acceptable to indefinitely reject a client's request simply, because basic resources are not available to all. Therefore, the Resource Allocation with Efficient Task Scheduling in Cloud Computing Using Hierarchical Auto-associative Polynomial Convolutional Neural Network (RA-HAPCNN-CC) approach is proposed in this paper to address the mentioned issues. The features of proposed RA-HAPCNN-CC approach are: (i) Starling Murmuration Optimizer (SMO)-based short scheduler decreases the make-span time and increases throughput for task scheduling, (ii) Hierarchical Auto-associative Polynomial Convolutional Neural Network (HAPCNN) for effective resource allocation under various design constraints, like bandwidth, resource load, (iii) Fractional Discrete Meixner Moments Encryption (FDMME) is considered for data encryption to offer protection for data storage, (iv) RA-HAPCNN-CC approach is analyzed to the state-of-art methods to verify the efficiency. The outcomes of resource utilization, energy consumption, response time demonstrate that the RA-HAPCNN-CC method is better than existing one. The performance of the proposed method attains 27.5 %, 10.32 %, 16.65 % lower energy consumption, 30.93 %, 11.14 %, 15.3 % higher throughput compared with existing models. © 2024"

This has resulted in a significant shift and advancement in the way image content is created. As AIGIC requires the acquisition of substantial image datasets from user devices for training purposes, the data transmission link is highly complex, and the datasets are susceptible to illegal attacks from multiple parties during transmission, which has a detrimental impact on the integrity and real-time nature of the training data and affects the accuracy of the training results of the AIGIC model. Consequently, this paper proposed a real-time authentication mechanism to guarantee the secure transmission of AIGIC image datasets. The mechanism achieves anonymous identity protection for the user device providing the image dataset by introducing a certificate-less encryption system. In turn, an aggregated signature scheme with key negotiation algorithm is introduced to authenticate the user devices of legitimate image datasets. A performance analysis indicates that the mechanism proposed in this paper outperforms other related methods in terms of security and accuracy of AIGIC image model training results, while guaranteeing real-time transmission of AIGIC image datasets, at the same time, the time complexity is also lower, which can effectively ensure the timeliness of the algorithm. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024."

There are numerous applications in the area of network security, such as quality of service. The rapid development of network applications makes tackling the classification of encrypted traffic in an incremental learning environment attractive. However, the ambiguity and imbalance of traffic restrict existing incremental approaches from achieving satisfactory results. To overcome these obstacles, we provide (1) a unique clustering-based exemplar selection approach for storing the most representative data relevant to each learned traffic scenario, as well as filtering ambiguous traffic for knowledge replay. Furthermore, (2) we ensure consistent model performance across all trained classes while addressing traffic imbalance issues via an incremental contrastive distillation approach.

Cloud storage applications provide data sharing services with varying functionality. In some cloud storage systems that provide data sharing, such as e-health systems, hiding sensitive information fields is a necessity. Meanwhile, in sharing process, unauthorized entities may have access to these privacy fields. The resource-constrained computation capability for data owner (DO) is universal. To tackle above problems, we propose a sanitizer-based secure data sharing scheme where sanitizer performs most computations of encryption and signature after receiving the partially blinded data from DO. It also checks the legitimacy of visitors before CSP returns stored data file. Besides, adopting an attribute-based access policy guarantees further privacy and fine-grained access authorization. After verification, cloud will return the required data to the legitimate visitors. Moreover, integrity auditing to shared data file is based on certificateless authentication technique, which removes certificates issue of traditional cryptographic technique, avoids key-escrow attack risk caused by identity-based cryptography. Finally, the performance analysis and experimental results show that our proposed scheme is competitive in practical applications since it reduces the authenticator generation overhead by up to 21.6% and proof generation overhead by up to 12% compared with related schemes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Smart healthcare offers an ecosystem of IoT wireless networks, computers and software applications to enable medical tracking, mobility and emergency services through smart wearables. In this ecosystem, security attacks are continuously arisen and sensitive medical data are threatened. Strong cryptographic mechanisms are then crucial for securely processing smart healthcare data. Previously, traditional public key cryptosystems are utilized to address security concerns pertaining to healthcare sector. These cryptosystems provide security under hard problems like discrete logarithmic problem and bilinear pairing which are vulnerable to quantum attacks. In recent years, lattice-based cryptography (LBC) has emerged as a quantum-safe substitute to traditional public-key cryptosystems. In this context, we present a hierarchical healthcare structure where intra-cluster and inter-cluster communication patterns are defined. Then, we propose a security design based on LBC. For intra-cluster communications, a certificateless identity-based Diffie–Hellman key exchange protocol secure under learning with errors hard problem over lattices is designed. It is composed of a registration phase, login phase and a key agreement scheme. To ensure trust, security and interoperability between different healthcare stakeholders defining the inter-cluster communication pattern, post-quantum Blockchain technology is used. Dilithium lattice-based signature scheme is proposed to replace the current ECDSA blockchain signature scheme. The communication and computation costs of the proposed key agreement protocol has been evaluated in comparison with the traditional ECDH-ECDSA key exchange scheme and to an authenticated version of a post-quantum key agreement scheme named SIKE-Dilithium. The obtained results prove the efficacy of our proposal. Moreover, through security analysis, we have demonstrated that the proposed security design ensures security requirements of healthcare application and can effectively resist quantum and classical attacks. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

The data and systems in medical institutions are frequently attacked by network due to their high value and vulnerability. A large number of network security attacks may damage medical services and affect patient safety. A dynamic rotation medical image encryption scheme based on improved Lorenz chaos is proposed for solving the security problems such as theft and tampering faced by digital medical images in Internet transmission. Firstly, in order to improve the key randomness and security of image encryption, we improved the classical Lorenz chaotic system. By adding new nonlinear adjustment terms and control parameters, the generated pseudo-random numbers are more unpredictable. From 0–1 test analysis, Lyapunov exponent and different analysis results, it can be seen that the improved Lorenz chaotic system has a wider range of chaotic parameters and better chaotic characteristics. We use the improved chaotic system as a key generator and apply it to the proposed image encryption scheme with dynamic rotation permutation and double diffusion. Under the premise of two kinds of scrambling modes within a block and between blocks, a pixel exchange threshold is innovatively designed to judge the feasibility and effectiveness of the exchange of pre-exchange pixels. The diffusion algorithm uses a relatively novel filter diffusion method to diffuse the scrambled image, and then uses a dynamic diffusion method to further improve the security of the ciphertext image. Through the analysis of the experimental results of a number of security tests, it can be seen that the proposed scheme is more effective in image encryption, and can effectively resist common attacks. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024."

A new N-dimensional closed-loop coupled triangular wave model is developed to overcome the limitations of the sine function in chaotic systems while reducing the difficulty of the chaotic system design. Experimental analysis demonstrates that the generated chaotic systems exhibit complex chaotic behaviors and outperform other chaotic systems designed using the sine function. Specifically, we utilize difference extension technology to embed key information into the plaintext image and design a scrambling and diffusion algorithm based on Latin rectangles to encrypt the remaining pixel matrix without key information.

Some existing deep-learning based ETC approaches have achieved promising results, but have limitations in real-world network environments: (1) label bias caused by traffic class imbalance and (2) traffic homogeneity due to component sharing. How to leverage open-domain unlabeled imbalanced traffic data to learn representation with strong generalization ability remains a key challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel imbalanced traffic representation model, called Contrastive Encrypted Traffic Pre-training (CETP), which pre-trains deep multi-granularity traffic representation from imbalanced data without directly using application labels. The pre-trained model can be further mitigated against label bias due to imbalance by semi-supervised continual fine-tuning via pseudo-label iterations and dynamic loss-weighting algorithms. CETP achieves state-of-the-art performance across four imbalanced encrypted traffic classification tasks, remarkably improving the F1 to 96.31% (2.74%↑) for CP-Android, 93.86% (3.58%↑) for CIC-2019, and 84.16% (10.19%↑) for ISCX-VPN. Meanwhile, we further validate the effectiveness of CETP in QUIC-based imbalanced encrypted traffic. Notably, we verify through analytical experiments that CETP not only effectively relieves label bias and homogeneous flow misclassification, but also extends to ETC methods with diverse feature extractors. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

To begin, instead of employing a decomposition method, a Lyapunov direct approach is proposed to achieve the finite-time synchronization of FOQVNNs using event-triggered control based on state errors. The settling time is then estimated using a unique fractional differential inequality. The event-triggered impulsive controller, which updates only during triggering instants, is proposed to be more inexpensive and efficient. Then, utilizing fractional Lyapunov theory and the comparison principle, several novel quaternion-valued linear matrix inequalities criteria are defined to assure the impulsive synchronization of the delayed FOQVNNs.

Traditional cloud computing faces serious problems of latency and energy consumption in handling massive data. Mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged to dramatically improve computing efficiency and reduce energy consumption by placing computing servers at network edge locations close to vehicles. However, the service range of MEC servers is limited and cannot fully satisfy user requirements. In addition, the task offloading process has security risks. The current research focuses on how to reduce the energy consumption and latency overhead of task offloading and neglects the economic cost or data transmission security of vehicles. To solve the above problems, we propose a cooperative security offloading (CSO) scheme for auxiliary vehicles and MEC servers. Firstly, we propose a dynamic pricing mechanism for computing resources by considering the credibility of MEC servers and auxiliary vehicles, the urgency of the task, and the number of users competing for auxiliary vehicles. Secondly, to prevent malicious MEC servers and eavesdroppers from attacking, we employ homomorphic encryption to protect user privacy. Meanwhile, efficient and secure computing services are achieved by optimizing user selection decisions, offloading decisions, and resource allocation decisions. Finally, the optimal decisions are obtained by the dueling DQN-based resource allocation and pricing strategy (DDRP) and the cost-minimizing security offloading (CMSO) algorithm, which minimizes the economic cost of users while maximizing security.

This study addresses the twin challenges of bribery and coercion that undermine most existing electronic voting systems. Recognizing the limitations of current security measures, which fail to protect voter autonomy even after the disclosure of voting secrets, we propose an innovative level-five secure e-voting system. By integrating an additional setup phase, our system maintains voter volition, ensuring security even when key secrets are compromised. Utilizing cryptographic techniques, blind signatures, and subliminal channels in conjunction with smart card PIN mechanisms, our approach not only bolsters system security but also enhances its potential for widespread adoption.

It allows to send verifiably encrypted messages satisfying certain requirements to certified members of a group, while keeping the anonymity of the receivers. Similar to the tracing mechanism in group signatures, the receiver of any ciphertext can be identified by an opening authority - should the needs arise. The primitive of GE is motivated by a number of interesting privacy-preserving applications, including the filtering of encrypted emails sent to certified members of an organization. This paper aims to improve the state-of-affairs of GE systems. Our first contribution is the formalization of fully dynamic group encryption (FDGE) - a GE system simultaneously supporting dynamic user enrolments and user revocations. The latter functionality for GE has not been considered so far. As a second contribution, we realize the message filtering feature for GE based on a list of t-bit keywords and 2 commonly used policies: “permissive” - accept the message if it contains at least one of the keywords as a substring; “prohibitive” - accept the message if all of its t-bit substrings are at Hamming distance at least d from all keywords, for d≥1. This feature so far has not been substantially addressed in existing instantiations of GE based on DCR, DDH, pairing-based and lattice-based assumptions. Our third contribution is the first instantiation of GE under code-based assumptions. The scheme is more efficient than the lattice-based construction of Libert et al. (Asiacrypt'16) - which, prior to our work, is the only known instantiation of GE under post-quantum assumptions. Our scheme supports the 2 suggested policies for message filtering, and in the random oracle model, it satisfies the stringent security notions for FDGE that we put forward. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

However, a single shape change could not meet the growing needs of the information encryption field. Therefore, we aimed to find a photoluminescent and photochromic LCN to enrich the application of photodeformable materials. Here, a light-driven LCN consisting of two distinct kinds of photosensitive moieties, cyanostilbene (CS) and spiropyran (SP), named CS∙SP∙LCN, has been designed and synthesized. The resultant LCN film displayed multiple photo/thermal responsive properties. On the one hand, the trans–cis photoisomerization of CS gave the film capacity for photodeformation. On the other hand, the reversible conversion between ring-closed SP and ring-opened merocyanine (MC) under alternating stimulation of UV irradiation and heating gave the film capacity for tunable photoluminescence and photochromism. The CS∙SP∙LCN film can bend and change color/luminescence under UV irradiation, leading to multi-element writing simultaneously. Then, the written information could be hidden by heating and stretching. Notably, the film resumed bending after the second heating due to the good stability of the cis isomer of CS, realizing the first decryption. Finally, the color/luminescence of the film resumed after the second UV irradiation, completing the second decryption of the information. The CS∙SP∙LCN films synthesized in this study could realize multi-element encryption and step-by-step decryption through the cooperation of CS and SP, achieving more advanced information storage and encryption possibilities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Adopting a design science approach, a framework is proposed and then further developed into a system that is implemented, illustrated, and evaluated in a case study. The system uses non-fungible tokens to tokenize building design IPR and deploys blockchain's decentralized consensus mechanisms, distributed ledgers, and cryptographic algorithms to safeguard the IPR and its transactions. This prototype system is found feasible with satisfactory performance in enhancing the efficiency of IPR registration and protection, reducing cost, improving information transparency, reinforcing immutability, and preventing non-valuable registrations.

However, the existence of binary and ternary Euclidean LCD codes has not been totally characterized. Hence it is interesting to construct binary and ternary Euclidean LCD codes with new parameters. In this paper, we construct new families of binary and ternary leading-systematic Euclidean LCD codes from some special functions including semibent functions, quadratic functions, almost bent functions, and planar functions. These LCD codes are not constructed directly from such functions, but come from some self-orthogonal codes constructed with such functions.

The proposed scheme comprises registration, authentication, and key selection phases. Devices are registered in the registration phase after the successful completion of validation checks, while sessions’ keys are granted to the registered devices in the authentication phase. In the final phase, controllers classify IoT devices based on pre-defined parameters and impose class-specific access control based on classification. The security of the proposed scheme is validated using the widely accepted AVISPAs verification tool against a strong adversary.

In chaos theory, systems with positive MLE values are considered chaotic, and larger MLE values generally indicate more robust chaos. A higher MLE suggests a more chaotic and complex behavior, which could be beneficial for encryption as it might provide enhanced security due to increased sensitivity to initial conditions and resistance to attacks. This paper searches for whether a 1D seed chaotic map or a 1D integrated chaotic map is preferred for image encryption. Does the MLE have any role? Firstly, three 1D integrated chaotic maps were designed: Sine-Cubic Integrated Map(SCIM), Tent-Logistic Integrated Map(TLIM), and Sine-Logistic Integrated Map(SLIM). These integrated chaotic maps are designed using the four available seed maps: sine, logistics, cubic, and tent. Thus, we have considered seven 1D chaotic maps to analyse and answer the question. Secondly, image encryption and decryption are performed using the considered seven 1D chaotic maps, one after the other, and the security measures of the encrypted image are analysed using various available tools. The image encryption is performed using block shuffling as diffusion and bit-Xor operation as the confusion process. A comparative analysis is performed using the six quantitative security analysis tools. According to the encryption correlation coefficient value of 0.0017, the Pick Signal-To-Noise Ratio(PSNR) value of 9.204, the Mean Square Error(MSE) value of 7809.1, the Number of Pixel Change Rate(NPCR) value of 95.3903, the Unified Average Change Intensity(UACI) value of 33.3676, and the information entropy value of 7.9635, the sine map is ranked first in security. The comparative analysis result reveals that seed maps give better encrypted image security than integrated chaotic maps. Therefore, integrating 1D chaotic maps is not guaranteed to get a better-secured encrypted image. Further analysis is made to understand if the MLE directly impacts the security of the encrypted process. It is found that the integrated chaotic maps provide a higher MLE. However, in this analysis, we couldn’t observe the direct relationship between the MLE and the security of the encrypted image. This suggests that other factors beyond just MLE contribute to the security of the encryption process. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

PERK achieves the smallest signature sizes for any PKP-based scheme for NIST category I security with 6 kB, while obtaining competitive signing and verification timings. PERK also compares well with the general state-of-the-art. To substantiate those claims we provide an optimized constant-time AVX2 implementation, a detailed performance analysis and different size-performance trade-offs. Technically our scheme is based on a Zero-Knowledge Proof of Knowledge following the MPC-in-the-Head paradigm and employing the Fiat–Shamir transform. We provide comprehensive security proofs, ensuring EUF-CMA security for PERK in the random oracle model. The efficiency of PERK greatly stems from our particular choice of PKP variant which allows for an application of the challenge-space amplification technique due to Bidoux–Gaborit (C2SI 2023). Our second main contribution is an in-depth study of the hardness of the introduced problem variant. First, we establish a link between the hardness of our problem variant and the hardness of standard PKP. Then, we initiate an in-depth study of the concrete complexity to solve our variant. We present a novel algorithm which outperforms previous approaches for certain parameter regimes. However, the proximity of our problem variant to the standard variant can be controlled via a specific parameter. This enables us to effectively safeguard against our new attack and potential future extensions by a choice of parameters that ensures only a slight variation from standard PKP. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

One well-known difficulty is the simultaneous modulation of phase and amplitude of electromagnetic wavefronts with a high modulation depth. A less appreciated challenge is scrambling of the information and images with hologram bending. Here, this work shows that chirality-guided pixelation of plasmonic kirigami sheets enables tunable multiplexed holography at terahertz (THz) frequencies. The convex and concave structures with slanted Au strips exhibit gradual variations in geometries facilitating modulation of light ellipticity reaching 40 deg. Real-time switching of 3D images of the letter “M” and the Mona Lisa demonstrates the possibility of complex grey-scale information content and importance of continuously variable mirror asymmetry. Microscale chirality measures of each pixel experiences little change with bending while retaining controllable reconfigurability upon stretching, which translates to remarkable resilience of chiral holograms to bending. Simplicity of their design with local chirality measures opens the door to information technologies with fault-tolerant THz encryption, wearable holographic devices, and new communication technologies. © 2024 The Author(s).

VLC technology uses light-emitting diodes (LEDs) within existing infrastructure to emit light within the visible spectrum. VLC complements traditional radio frequency (RF) communications, addressing its inherent limitations and drawbacks. To navigate the demands of modern urban environments, VLC systems must prioritize secure data transmission, accessibility, and economic feasibility, particularly within the framework of smart cities. We introduce what is to our knowledge a novel privacy-enhanced VLC system for optical wireless communication. Leveraging color data modulation techniques and the intricacies of a hyperchaotic three-dimensional map, this innovative approach ensures robust security. By employing diverse LED colors for data transmission and exploiting the unpredictable mathematical properties of hyperchaotic maps, enhanced privacy is achieved. The performance of the proposed system was rigorously evaluated through various tests, manipulating initial control parameters of the encryption process with the hyperchaotic map, as well as adjusting message length and content. Tests were conducted over a 1 m connection distance at a symbol transmission rate of 2 baud. Remarkably, the proposed system demonstrated high accuracy in message recovery, achieving a symbol error rate (SER) of only 0.02 at an incident optical power of 22 μW. We highlight the critical importance of precise decryption parameter values in the proposed method, demonstrating the necessity for accuracy within the range of {10}{- 15} for each decryption parameter; it underscores the indispensability of meticulous parameter calibration to ensure the correct decryption of transmitted symbols.

Although the CA/Browser (CA/B) Forum publishes compliance requirements for CAs, there are no guarantees that even a commercially successful CA is complying with these recommendations. In this paper, we propose the first systematic CA ranking mechanism that ranks CAs in terms of their adherence to the CA/B Forum and X.509 certificate standards. Unfortunately, there is no consolidated and widely accepted parameter to rank the CAs so we have proposed formula-based rating models and introduced different ranking techniques like Direct, Bayesian, and MarkovChain Ranking. These rankings are applied to a comprehensive dataset of X.509 trust chains gathered during the time period of 2020 to 2023. Our proposed ranking scheme can serve as a criterion for both consumers and enterprises for selecting and prioritizing CAs based on performance as well as adherence to the certificate standards. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Current encryption schemes can be fall into two categories, and one of them involves directly illuminating the metasurfaces to decrypt hidden information. The security of this approach is limited. Another category of scheme is indirect-observation decryption, which makes the hidden information can only be decoded with direct-observation ciphertext from the metasurfaces and the particular key. Indirect-observation decryption improve security but sacrifices the information of the direct-observation channel. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new encryption scheme which integrates direct-observation and indirect-observation channels, introduces the switched VO2 and angular multiplexing scheme, making full use of all channels to stored information and applies hierarchical encryption strategy to improve security. Specifically, Half of the plaintext information can be acquired from the direct-observation channel by directly observing the metasurface based on simultaneous polarization and angular multiplexing at the operating wavelength of 633 nm, while the obtained information is used as ciphertext for the indirect-observation channel. Then the remaining information can be decrypted from the ciphertext using specific algorithm with the correct keys and decryption devices. In addition, the switch functionality of VO2 is applied to hide direct-observation channel. Our work integrates the two channels with different observation methods, and the full information can only be obtained by decrypting the above two channels with different security levels. Our work substantially expands the design freedom for optical encryption and may facilitate further exploration of optical storage and optical encryption. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Medical image encryption plays a vital role in ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive medical data and safeguarding patient privacy. This research addresses these concerns by introducing a novel approach, RISE, to medical image security by using the fusion of chaotic keys and a secret-sharing technique. The key advancement is the use of a Rubik’s cube-based bit-plane shuffling technique to reduce the complexity of strong image encryption, adding a unique dimension to the field of medical image security. Another distinguishing aspect of our approach is the strategic use of segmentation to encrypt only the sensitive part of the image and reduce the time complexity. This area is encrypted using a chaotic key with a Rubik’s cube-based bit-plane shuffling algorithm, followed by the implementation of the confusion process. The encrypted image is shared using a K-N Secret sharing method, which provides authentication and high robustness. The final decrypted image is enhanced using super-resolution to provide better information outputs. The proposed technique offers excellent security and produces better outcomes while being simple. The average NPCR and UACI scores of the proposed encryption technique are 99.47, and 49.90, respectively, and the entropy is 7.995, underscoring the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed approach. It has a high key bit sensitivity and average time complexity.

However, charge separation (CS) is efficient only under ultraviolet excitation in most OLPL systems because it requires a driving force from the large energy difference between the local excited (LE) and charge transfer (CT) states. In this study, a multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) molecule is incorporated into an exciplex system to achieve efficient OLPL in a composite material activated by visible light via a stepwise charge/energy transfer process. The enhanced absorption of the composite material facilitated a tenfold increase in the duration of the OLPL, which can last for several hours under visible light excitation. The excited state of the MR-TADF molecule tends to charge transfer to the acceptor, followed by energy transfer to the exciplex, which benefits from the small difference between the LE and CT states owing to the inherent CS characteristics of the opposing resonance effect. Afterglow displays of these composite materials are fabricated to demonstrate their considerable potential in encryption patterns and emergency lights, which take advantage of their excellent processability, visible light activation, and tunable luminescence properties. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

However, most existing MABSE schemes rely on traditional number-theoretic assumptions, which maybe vulnerable to attack in the era of quantum-computers. Besides, the effective revocation of user attributes is also crucial in searchable encryption. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a new multi-authority ciphertext-policy attribute-based searchable encryption scheme for securely sharing encrypted data in the cloud. By calling Shamir's threshold secret-sharing technology twice, we achieve co-management of the master key by attribute authorities and interactive generation of user private keys. Furthermore, the KUNodes algorithm is employed for attribute revocation, offering a mechanism to update private keys for non-revoked users. Compared to other schemes, MCP-ABSE-AR introduces multiple attribute authorities responsible for managing user attributes collectively. Additionally, it provides functionalities for keyword searching and attribute revocation.

Secondly, we compute the number of monomials of given degree in the inverse of χn (if it exists). This number coincides with binomial coefficients. Lastly, we consider χn as a polynomial map, to study whether the same rule (yi=xi+(xi+1+1)xi+2) gives a bijection on field extensions of F2.

Ultrafast laser-induced plasma core coloring of metal nanoparticles is susceptible to oxidation, resulting in color fading and demanding costly substrate materials. Similarly, ultrafast laser-induced periodic surface structure coloring (LIPSS) suffers from low processing efficiency and the generation of iridescent colors due to diffraction, limiting its industrial applicability. In this study, we successfully achieved stable, highly saturated structural colors with excellent angular independence using a simple nanosecond laser double-scan method based on the principle of laser-induced oxide film-induced interference effect coloring, and we described the colors within a color space based on human color perception. Our research profoundly explores the impact of laser fluence during the first scan on the optical properties of the final double-scan coloring. Through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis, we observed micron-sized periodic structures on the surface of the alloy created by the laser double-scan method. These structures induce multiple internal reflections, reducing surface reflectivity within the visible light spectrum and ultimately influencing its optical properties. Furthermore, we successfully utilized this technique to conceal text, QR codes, and images within other images, offering an innovative and cost-effective solution for large-scale information steganography of structural color and anti-counterfeiting. © 2024"

Initially, the position of the initial window is determined, and to ensure the traversal of the window, the initial window position is set to the top-left corner of the original image. Subsequently, the step size for window movement is determined, and chaotic sequences generated by QBCS are used to scramble the contents selected by each window. Moreover, on the basis of the standard index scrambling concept, a dynamic stack traversal method is employed, wherein the behavior of elements entering and exiting the stack is determined according to the chaotic sequences generated by QBCS, effectively expanding the value space of the chaotic index sequence.

We test pod-to-pod TCP and UDP throughput as well as Kubernetes application programming interface (API) response times, in multiple scenarios, accounting for adverse network conditions such as packet loss or packet delay. Based on the obtained measurement results and through analysis of the underlying strengths and weaknesses of the individual implementations, we draw conclusions on the preferred VPN solution depending on the use-case at hand, striking a balance between usability and performance. © 2024 The Authors.

Here, it is reported that by programmably integrating newly developed 1D quasi-periodic folding structures into a 3D photonic crystal, the generated photonic superstructure exhibits distinctive optical effects that combine independently manipulatable specular and anisotropic diffuse reflections within a versatile protein-based platform, thus creating different optical channels for structural color imaging. The polymorphic transition of the protein format allows for the facile modulation of both folding patterns and photonic lattices and, therefore, the superstructure's spectral response within each channel. The capacity to manipulate the structural assembly of the superstructure enables the programmable encoding of multiple independent patterns into a single system, which can be decoded by the simple adjustment of lighting directions. The multifunctional utility of the photonic platform is demonstrated in information processing, showcasing its ability to achieve multimode transformation of information codes, multi-code high-capacity storage, and high-level numerical information encryption. The present strategy opens new pathways for achieving multichannel transformable imaging, thereby facilitating the development of emerging information conversion, storage, and encryption media using photonic crystals. © 2024 The Author(s).

In the automotive industry, FOTA can keep the firmware of the various electronic controllers up-to-date without any manual intervention, so that to improve the operational performance and quickly fix the security vulnerabilities of vehicles. Of course, FOTA must avoid that a malicious party installs vulnerable or backdoored firmware on electronic controllers, which may lead to safety risks for the driver. It follows that a FOTA management system must guarantee the integrity and authenticity of all the firmware updates. While these security requirements are generally guaranteed by means of digital signatures, the advent of quantum computing is making traditional signature schemes increasingly vulnerable. Large-scale quantum computers able to break RSA and ECDSA could appear during the long lifetime of vehicles that are now in production, which can often reach two decades. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the performance from an automotive FOTA perspective of Crystals-Dilithium and Falcon, two quantum-resistant lattice-based digital signature schemes that have been selected in 2022 by the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization process, and that represent the most probable choices for the future security technology. In particular, we evaluate the running time of various cryptographic operations performed by Uptane, which is a standard for automotive FOTA systems by the IEEE Industry Standards and Technology Organization, on three reference hardware architectures representing different classes of electronic control units. By means of experiments we also highlight that the hashing function is the primary limiting factor for the performance of automotive FOTA and, consequently, is the most convenient component to accelerate in hardware to improve FOTA execution time. Finally, we propose a hardware accelerator for SHAKE, the hash function used by both Crystals-Dilithium and Falcon, and experimentally evaluate the performance improvement that it brings about in automotive FOTA operations. © 2024 The Authors"

However, fabricating multiple stimuli into a single component crystal still remains challenging. In this study, a polymorphic elasto-plastic Schiff-based crystal displaying morphology-dependent photomechanical motions is designed and investigated. Both Form I and Form II of it exhibit dual plasticity and elasto-plasticity along different facets, which is attributed to the slidable separating layers. Moreover, Form I retains its elastic bending ability even after being plastically twisted, owing to the well-maintained strong π–π interactions, whereas Form II can not twist without fractures. In addition, the photomechanical motions of Form I including jumping, twisting to bending are realized by adjusting the crystal morphologies, while Form II is lacking in response to ultraviolet light irradiation. Theoretical calculation analysis reveals that lattice deformation induced by photoisomerization of Form I is the driving forces for crystal motions. Furthermore, reversible luminescence switching behaviors are realized in Form I and Form II upon acid-base fumigation as well as heating. The synergistic multi-stimuli-responsive mode based on heat, acid, and solvent stimuli provides an alternative path for multi-mode information encryption. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

In the ITS, intelligent connected vehicle can access a variety of latency-sensitive cloud services through the vulnerable wireless communication channel, which could lead to security and privacy issues. To prevent access by malicious nodes, a large number of authentication schemes have been proposed. However, with the diversification of cloud services and the rapid development of quantum computing, there are many drawbacks remain, including timeliness of authentication and resisting quantum computing. In light of this, we propose a lattice-based secure and efficient multi-cloud authentication and key agreement scheme for quantum key distribution (QKD) enabled IoV. Its features are as follows: i) Security-enhanced and Efficient Authentication: We combine the lattice-based lightweight signatures and quantum authentication keys to guarantee security-enhanced authentication. Meanwhile, we propose the quantum security service cloud (QSC) to manage the authentication of all vehicles and cloud server providers (CSPs) to reduce the authentication rounds and improve efficiency. ii) Extended Quantum Key Distribution (eQKD): In wireless networks, quantum key agreement is achieved through the pre-filled quantum keys. In wired networks, quantum key is accomplished by QKD with Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol. Furthermore, formal and informal security demonstrates that the scheme could resist potential security attacks. The performance comparison illustrates that our scheme could decrease the computational overhead by 27.23%-81.78% and authentication rounds by 81.34%-93.10%. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

To balance safety and efficiency, this paper presents a novel encryption scheme for hyperspectral images using a 4D Lorenz hyperchaotic system, 3D Zigzag-like transformation, and brushing diffusion. Firstly, the scheme utilizes the 4D hyperchaotic Lorenz system to generate pseudo-random sequences for scrambling and diffusion. The initial values correlated with the plaintext are obtained using the SHA-256 algorithm to enhance resistance against differential and plaintext attacks. Secondly, the brushing diffusion algorithm is employed to enhance the avalanche effect without significantly compromising the speed of the encryption process. Thirdly, the 3D Zigzag-like transformation with two key parameters is proposed and applied to reduce intra-band and inter-band adjacent pixel correlations. Experimental evaluations and security analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the scheme. The scheme offers a large key space, quick process, high key sensitivity, acceptable randomness in the ciphertext, and excellent visual reconstruction quality. Furthermore, it demonstrates resistance against common attacks, including statistical, differential, and plaintext attacks. In conclusion, the proposed encryption scheme effectively protects hyperspectral images while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

By simultaneously exploiting the photo-adsorption oxygen dissociation property of ZnO and the persistent photoconductivity effect of MoS2, the device demonstrates synaptic capability of four-color perception with a single synaptic event consuming a mere 2.55×10−9 J.

However, a large number of pairing operations required for decryption affect the wide use of ABE on lightweight devices. A general solution is to outsource the heavy computation to the cloud service provider (CSP), leaving the lighter computation to the data user. Nevertheless, it is impractical to assume that the CSP will provide free services. A recent ABE scheme with payable outsourced decryption ABEPOD (TIFS’20) provides a solution for the above payment issue. The CSP is generally untrusted, however, ABEPOD does not offer a verification mechanism for the data user to verify the correctness of the message. Moreover, the use of dual key pairs in ABEPOD incurs a significant computational overhead for data users during the key generation phase. We address the above issues by presenting a new blockchain-based verifiable outsourced attribute-based encryption system that enables data users to verify the correctness of plaintexts. We implement batch verification using homomorphic technical to optimize the verification process. We use the technique of dichotomous search to accurately locate problematic plaintexts. Additionally, we optimize three key-generation algorithms to transfer the computational cost from the data user to the key generation center. We offer the formal security models and the instantiation system with security analysis. As compared to ABEPOD, we further optimize the key-generation algorithms such that the computational overhead of transformation-key and verification-key generation for data users is reduced from O(Ω) to O(1) and reduced by half respectively, where Ω is the number of attributes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Image steganography has emerged as a pivotal technique for concealing sensitive information within images, amidst growing threats to copyright protection and content integrity. To address these challenges, this research proposes a novel approach that combines the dynamic 8-bit XOR algorithm with the AES crypto algorithm, aiming to fortify the outcomes of image steganography. The method entails encrypting messages using AES encryption, followed by embedding them within images using the dynamic XOR method, ensuring both security and imperceptibility. The study’s objectives include assessing the impact of secret message size and stego image dimensions on algorithm efficiency, evaluating through metrics like PSNR, MSE, NPCR, and entropy. Notably, histogram analysis reveals minimal differences between original and stego images, underscoring the difficulty in detecting hidden information. Moreover, the study delves into the influence of secret message size on algorithm performance, highlighting a trade-off between text size and PSNR, where smaller sizes exhibit stronger concealment capabilities. Additionally, the impact of stego image dimension size is examined, revealing varied performance metrics based on different dimensions. Comparisons with existing encryption methods indicate favourable outcomes for the proposed algorithm in terms of PSNR, NPCR, and entropy. Notably, PSNR values range from 74.17 to 80.17 dB, while NPCR values vary from 87.98 to 99.81%. Moreover, MSE values range from 0.000621 to 0.04, and entropy values range from 7.39 to 7.64 dB.

With a long lifetime of 2.82 s and a high quantum yield of 21.40%, these copolymers exhibit not only color-tunable FL from violet-red to blue, but also multicolor UOP scope from blue to chartreuse when the excitation wavelength is changed. Moreover, a nearly-white phosphorescence can also be observed by adjusting the excitation wavelength.

A significant problem is developing a simple security mechanism suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices. Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is extensively utilized and well-suited for use in low-resource environments like smartphone devices. ECC utilizes short crypto keys with the same security strength as conventional cryptosystems, decreasing power consumption and enhancing device efficiency. This study comprehensively evaluates ECC data privacy and security techniques in IoT-based devices. The research also looked into other cryptography protocols that ECC may use to increase security and performance. The inclusion procedures were papers published between 2018 and 2023, written in English, and published in a peer-reviewed scholarly outlet. This research eventually reviewed 61 suitable publications in total. Compared to other cryptographic methods, the study discovered that ECC has received greater attention or is frequently employed in IoT-based systems. However, additional issues and concerns must be addressed, including efficient IoT device security, maintaining privacy, and device security against vulnerability assaults such as man-in-the-middle attacks.

With the exponential advancement in the evolution of cloud computing domains in healthcare (HC), the security and confidentiality of medical records have evolved into a primary consideration for HC services and applications. There needs to be more than the present-day cryptosystems to address these troubles. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel Three-Factor Authentication (3FA) and optimal Map-Reduce (MR) framework for secure BD transmission over the cloud with Secure Hashing Authentication XOR-ed Elliptical Curve Cryptography (SHAXECC). The authentication procedure is initially carried out with the SHA-512 algorithm, which protects the network from unauthorized access. Next, data deduplication is done using the SHA-512 algorithm to eliminate duplicate files. After that, an optimal MR design is introduced to handle a large amount of BD. In an optimal MR, the mapper uses the Modified Fuzzy C-means (MFCM) clustering approach to initially form the BD clusters. Then, the reducer uses the Levy Flight and Scoring Mutation-based Chimp Optimization Algorithm (LSCOA) to form final BD clusters. Finally, the SHAXECC is used to transmit the data securely. Experiments are performed to compare the superiority of the proposed technique with the existing techniques in terms of some performance measures. The proposed approach outperformed other existing models concerning clustering and security measures. So, the proposed model is the best for data protection and privacy in cloud-enabled HC data. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Acrylic acid (AA) and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) are used as hydrophilic monomers, and methoxyethyl acrylate (MEA) serves as a hydrophobic monomer. To endow the organohydrogel with a photo-responsive property, a fluorescent monomer, 1′-acryloyl chloride-3′,3′-dimethyl-6-nitrospiropyran (SPMA) is added. Under ultraviolet (UV) and visible light irradiation, SPMA undergoes ring-opening and ring-closing isomerization reactions, respectively. This leads to enhanced and reduced fluorescence. This fluorescence tunability allows for the local regulation of fluorescence in the organohydrogel using a photomask. By employing UV and visible light, complex information can be repeatedly written and erased on the organohydrogel. Additionally, based on the interactions between dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and water within the system, the organohydrogel exhibits excellent anti-freezing and water-holding properties, allowing its use in low-temperature environments and extended preservation time. The organohydrogel has precise information writing capabilities and is more difficult to falsify as an information encryption platform.

This paper introduces a robust alternative mitigation strategy based on Physical-Layer Authentication (PLA), which leverages the intrinsic physical layer characteristics of IoT devices. These unique imperfections, stemming from the manufacturing process of IoT electronic integrated circuits (ICs), are difficult to replicate or falsify and vary with each function executed by the IoT device. We propose a novel lightweight authentication scheme, MAG-PUFs, that uses the unintentional Electromagnetic (EM) emissions from IoT devices as Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). MAG-PUFs operate by collecting these unintentional EM emissions during the execution of pre-defined reference functions by the IoT devices. The authentication is achieved by matching these emissions with profiles recorded at the time of enrollment, using state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) approaches such as Neural Networks (NN) and Autoencoders. Notably, MAG-PUFs offer compelling advantages: (i) it preserves privacy, as it does not require direct access to the IoT devices; and, (ii) it provides unique flexibility, permitting the selection of numerous and varied reference functions. We rigorously evaluated MAG-PUFs using 25 Arduino devices and a diverse set of 325 reference function classes. Employing a DL framework, we achieved a minimum authentication F1-Score of 0.99. Furthermore, the scheme's efficacy in detecting impostor EM emissions was also affirmed, achieving a minimum F1-Score of 0.99. We also compared our solution to other solutions in the literature, showing its remarkable performance. Finally, we discussed code obfuscation techniques and the impact of Radio Frequency (RF) interference on the IoT authentication process. © 2024 The Author(s)"

On the other hand, the de facto IoT routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks called RPL is vulnerable to various types of routing attacks. Many researchers have investigated RPL security solutions focusing on effective detection of prevalent and destructive routing attacks such as blackhole attack, selective forwarding attack, rank attack and so on. Recent studies are proposing trust-based mechanisms with the aim of replacing traditional cryptography-based operations with lightweight security models in order to cover the inherent challenges of IoT devices, including energy and computational limitations. Therefore, in this paper, focusing on the problem of RPL vulnerability against well-known routing attacks, we have proposed a trust-based attack detection model, which investigates traffic behavior in different attack scenarios and detects malicious nodes relying on behavior deviation exactly at the same time as the start of any attack activity. Expected behavior is predicted by our learning model trained from the historical routing behavior pattern, using recurrent neural networks as a powerful deep learning method, which leads to attack detection with high-level accuracy and precision. Both mathematical analysis and simulation results on multiple RPL attack scenarios show clearly that the proposed trust-based defense mechanism is an effective approach capable of timely and precisely detection of routing behavior pattern deviation of malicious nodes exactly at the start time of the attack occurrence, which leads to attack detection and attacker identification based on trust scores extracted from the detected fluctuations between expected and real routing behavior patterns. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

It is significant to construct the new models, which can simulate a class of the real neural networks in the disturbed environment, and the fast synchronization control strategies are studied by an adjustable parameter α. A controller with coupling signal is designed to study the exponential synchronization problem, meanwhile, another effective controller with not only adjustable synchronization rate but also with infinite gain avoided is used to investigate the preset-time synchronization. The fast synchronization conditions have been obtained by Lyapunov stability principle, Laplacian matrix and some inequality techniques. A numerical example shows the effectiveness of the control schemes, and the different control factors for synchronization rate are given to discuss the control effect. In particular, the image encryption–decryption based on drive-response networks has been successfully applied. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, machine learning faces problems like high computation overhead, low training accuracy, and poor security due to data silos, privacy issues and communication limitations, especially in the environment of cloud computing. Logistic regression (LR) is a popular machine learning method used for prediction, while current LR algorithms suffer from high computation cost and communication burden due to interactions between users and cloud servers. In this paper, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Multi-party Logistic Regression (PPMLR) algorithm, which achieves privacy-preserving and non-interactive gradient descent regression training in machine learning. PPMLR uses the Distributed two Trapdoors Public-Key Cryptosystem (DT-PKC) as a main building block, which satisfies additive homomorphic encryption. Specifically, users go off-line after encrypting local private data, then the service provider (SP) trains the global logistic regression model by interacting with the cloud server (CS), so that the confidentiality and privacy of user's private data can be guaranteed during the training process. We prove by detailed security proof that PPMLR guarantees data and model privacy. Finally, we conduct experiments on two popular medical datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. The experimental results show that PPMLR can conduct privacy-preserving training efficiently. Comparison with the stat-of-the-art Privacy-Preserving Logistic Regression Algorithm (PPLRA) shows that the model training time is reduced by about 4 times. © 2024"

In the IoV, vehicles can exchange information with each other and with the roadside units making use of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). As this technology reaches near-to-market maturity levels, several issues arise related to the protection of users’ privacy, while the interest of adversaries for such private user data in IoV environments gets stronger. This paper aims to present a review of the state-of-the-art techniques tackling the protection of location privacy in IoV environments, as well as experimental evaluation findings regarding the usage of various cryptographic algorithms for the protection of information exchange in these networks. In the conducted evaluations, the AES algorithm has been used as the main standard, which has been coupled with several other encryption/decryption algorithms, such as RSA, ECC and NTRU. The metrics used for the evaluation include measurements over the key generation process, the certificate generation, the encryption/decryption times, the signature generation/verification times, etc. Moreover, the size of messages in the negotiation, the pseudonym exchange and the new pseudonym enabling phases has been recorded, while the energy consumption in the exchange pseudonyms phase has also been measured.

To protect the content security and visual safety of images, a learning visual image encryption scheme based on compressed sensing (CS) and cycle generative adversarial network is proposed. First, the secret image is sparse by discrete wavelet transform and compressed by CS. Secondly, the compressed image is permuted and diffused by an improved Henon map to obtain the ciphertext image. Finally, the images are migrated from the ciphertext domain to the plaintext domain by generating an adversarial network to obtain visually meaningful images.

With recent advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT), satellite-based IoT has emerged, enhancing global connectivity by enabling real-time communication between remote sensing devices and central hubs through satellite links. However, secure and authenticated communication between Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and resource-constrained ground devices remains underexplored. This paper introduces a novel homomorphic signcryption scheme designed for satellite IoT environments. Our scheme employs hyperelliptic curve cryptography and homomorphic encryption to facilitate the privacy-preserving transmission of aggregated data from multiple IoT devices to LEO satellites. We benchmark our homomorphic signcryption scheme against several established schemes tailored for different network environments, including for satellite networks, Identity-based Signcryption for Smart Grids, 3-Factor Authentication schemes and heterogeneous Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) encryption schemes. Our scheme demonstrates substantial improvements in computational efficiency, communication overhead, and storage capacity. It reduces computational costs by 90% to 99%, communication overhead by 41% to 92%, and storage demands by 62% to 93% compared to existing methods. These quantitative findings demonstrate the practical viability of our approach for satellite IoT deployments with limited resources. Additionally, the robustness of our approach is confirmed through formal security validation using BAN Logic and Scyther, which verifies its strong security, optimal performance, and privacy preservation capabilities, making it ideally suited for real-world satellite IoT systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Here, 2-benzylmalononitrile derivatives and a series of impurities were characterized and confirmed by NMR, HR-MS, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, forming host–guest bicomponent systems with dual-band and long-lived TADF (410 nm) and RTP (490–510 nm). At room temperature, TADF and RTP lifetimes are up to 1056 ms and 1027 ms in sequence. The intensity ratio between TADF and RTP can be well adjusted by grinding, temperature, as well as host and guest materials, presenting color-tunable and time-dependent afterglow from green to blue. Owing to the excellent crystallinity, the bicomponent systems also display lower sensitivity to external environments such as water vapor and oxygen. The high-level digital and program encryption, and anti-counterfeiting patterns were successfully constructed based on temperature sensitivity, and different TADF and RTP afterglow lifetimes of the doping systems. The work also provides deep blue persistent glow and clears the obstacles for large-scale production.

The transmitting and storing of medical images via the cloud-based network must meet several stringent criteria, including confidentiality, validity, and security, and are viewed as very sensitive, irrespective of the image processing context. Medical image copyright protection has been essential since little alterations can even put the lives of patients in danger. Hence numerous significant watermarking methods need to be developed. Watermarking conceals sensitive data by embedding it in a harmless medium, such as a cover. The challenging issue of quick and extremely safe image encryption can be solved more effectively with chaos-based cryptography. Thus the image is encrypted by using enhanced chaos with the Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (FFOA). The work proposes an efficient medical image watermarking approach using the Two-level Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique on chaotic encrypted medical images. Finally, the proposed method is compared with existing methods to demonstrate higher performance. To check robustness and imperceptibility results, the work is examined under various attacks and produces good results in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) measures.

However, current methodologies employed in quantum computing often require, among other things, a broad understanding of quantum hardware and low-level programming languages, posing challenges to software developers in effectively creating and implementing quantum services. This study advocates the adoption of software engineering principles in quantum computing, thereby establishing a higher level of hardware abstraction that allows developers to focus on application development. With this proposal, developers can design and deploy quantum services with less effort, which is similar to the facilitation provided by service-oriented computing for the development of conventional software services. This study introduces a continuous deployment strategy adapted to the development of quantum services that covers the creation and deployment of such services. For this purpose, an extension of the OpenAPI specification is proposed, which allows the generation of services that implement quantum algorithms. The proposal was validated through the creation of an application programming interface with diverse quantum algorithm implementations and evaluated through a survey of various developers and students who were introduced to the tool with positive results. © 2024 The Authors.

We focus on linearizing the polynomials leaked by the hash value to find its inverse. In an attack on 2-round Ascon-Xof, we carefully construct the set of guess bits using a greedy algorithm in the context of guess-and-determine. This allows us to attack Ascon-Xof more efficiently than the method in Dobraunig et al., and we fully implement our attack to demonstrate its effectiveness. We also provide the number of guess bits required to linearize one output bit after 3- and 4-round Ascon’s permutation, respectively. In particular, for the first time, we connect the result for 3-round Ascon to a preimage attack on Ascon-Xof with a 64-bit output. Our attacks primarily focus on analyzing weakened versions of Ascon-Xof, where the weakening involves setting all the IV values to 0 and omitting the round constants.

In the sharing process, user dynamic management and players/readers abuse has always been a problem that needs to be solved, but malicious encryptors are also a new challenge. Therefore, preventing malicious encryption is another way to protect copyright issues. This scheme proposes a traitor tracing scheme with puncturable-based broadcast encryption in cloud storage, which is an improved scheme proposed in Ref. Garg et al. (2010). Based on the original completely collusion resistant traitor tracing scheme, the uniform distribution of hash output is used to prevent malicious encryptors. In addition, users can perform authentication during the decryption phase to prevent replay attacks. At the same time, the puncture algorithm is introduced, so that normal users can dynamically revoke themselves without affecting the normal use of other users. We prove that the scheme is secure under chosen plaintext attack (CPA). Theoretical analysis also shows that our scheme can prevent malicious encryptors in cloud file sharing and allow normal users to dynamically revoke. After experimental verification, our scheme offers distinct advantages over the existing one. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Grundy-values or nim-values—is fundamental to combinatorial game theory. Beyond the winnability, nimbers provide a complete characterization of strategic interactions among impartial games in disjunctive sums. In this paper, we consider nimber-preserving reductions among impartial games, which enhance the winnability-preserving reductions in traditional computational characterizations of combinatorial games. We prove that GENERALIZED GEOGRAPHY is complete for the natural class, IP, of polynomially-short impartial rulesets, under polynomial-time nimber-preserving reductions. We refer to this notion of completeness as Sprague-Grundy-completeness. In contrast, we also show that not every PSPACE-complete ruleset in IP is Sprague-Grundy-complete for IP. By viewing every impartial game as an encoding of its nimber—a succinct game secret richer than its winnability alone—our technical result establishes the following striking cryptography-inspired homomorphic theorem: Despite the PSPACE-completeness of nimber computation for IP, there exists a polynomial-time algorithm to construct, for any pair of games G1,G2 in IP, a GENERALIZED GEOGRAPHY game G satisfying: nimber(G)=nimber(G1)⊕nimber(G2). © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

This has led to the development of Zero Trust Networking (ZTN) and Software Defined Perimeter (SDP) concepts, which aim to extend the perimeter of trust to every entity connected to the network regardless of their physical location. However, implementing complex security mechanisms and constant trust assurance for every interaction can be challenging. One solution is integrating blockchain technology into Zero Trust to provide security. Blockchain offers features such as data decentralization, anonymity, cryptography, and immutable record of transactions that can be utilized. This work proposes a mechanism for secure service session management using blockchain capabilities. Non-fungible tokens (NFT) are applied to access and provider tokens representing a policy agreement for service consumption. These tokens are mapped to the public addresses of entities registered in the blockchain.

Recently, the selection and optimization for the used metasurface structures and types have become research spots. Now the most researched and demonstrated meta-holograms are often based on discrete structures, which can achieve high efficiency but comparatively narrow working bandwidths or a wide wavelength range but low power efficiency. Therefore, contemporary meta-holograms struggle for realizing simultaneous broadband and high efficiency. In this paper, all-dielectric quasi-continuous metasurfaces composed of nanostrips are introduced to expand the operating bandwidth for high efficiency meta-holography. Benefiting from the associated Pancharatnam-Berry phase, the nanostrips with spatially orientation angles continuous changes can realize arbitrary phase modulation. For the first time, the average power efficiency of a meta-hologram is experimentally measured to be 56.63% over a broad wavelength band ranging from 500 to 1000 nm. In addition, based on this kind of all-dielectric quasi-continuous nanostrips, we also design and experimentally achieve multicolor three-dimensional (3D) holographic images. Actually, such all-dielectric quasi-continuous methodology proposed here can be used to design other functional meta-devices, including optical metalens, nanoprinting, and information encryption. © 2024 Author(s)."

New digital signature techniques allow for public verification that a sequence has not been modified and can contain sufficient information for synthetic DNA to be self-documenting. In translating these techniques from bacteria to more complex genetically modified organisms (GMOs), special considerations must be made to allow for public verification of these products.

However, due to users completing remote access and data transmission through open channels, ensuring user legitimacy and data security has become an important factor in IIoT. In addition, resource limited users or devices need to collect and publish corresponding messages while also timely processing instant messages obtained from the network. Leveraging edge computing technology effectively mitigates the transmission time of messages, addressing the challenges of high computing pressure and prolonged response time associated with cloud server computing. Therefore, investigating authentication key agreement based on edge computing in the IIoT environment holds substantial theoretical significance and practical importance. This article introduces an IIoT authentication that ensures both security and efficiency by integrating elliptic curve cryptography and three-factor authentication. Within this scheme, the user and the edge server accomplish security authentication. Through security analysis, the proposed scheme is proven to meet the essential security requirements.

In the encryption process, each plaintext image is firstly encrypted into two phase masks by using phase retrieval algorithm under structured light illumination with the help of encryption authenticable phase, and then the final ciphertext is generated by using phase mask multiplexing technology, overcoming the trade-off relationship between encryption capacity and decryption quality, thereby the decryption quality is improved meanwhile the encryption capacity is expanded. Furthermore, the optical parameters of structured phase mask in the structured light illumination are introduced as supplementary digital keys, expanding the key space and enhancing the security of encryption method. In the decryption process, the decryption authenticable phase needs to pass authentication before it is used to decrypt the ciphertext, leading to a further improvement for the level of security of encryption method.

To respond the challenge, we propose a secure Key Aggregation Keyword Searchable Encryption against Keyword Guessing Attack and Authorization Abuse (KASE-AKA) scheme. Compared with existing KASE schemes, our KASE-AKA scheme has the following merits: (1) supporting dynamic update of user data search right through a user data search right list maintained by the semi-trust cloud server. (2) preventing the authorization from being abused since the authorization key (aggregate key) associates the user's public key, a subset of access rights, and a common secret value that only the cloud and data owner can collaboratively generate. (3) providing resistance against offline keyword guessing attacks.

Lattice-based cryptography presents promising solutions with quantum-safe hard problems like learning with rounding, short integer solutions, learning with errors, and Module Learning with Rounding (MLWR). Proposed work presents an efficient MLWR-based PKE scheme that utilizes number-theoretic transforms to significantly reduce polynomial multiplication time up to 40%. Additionally, scheme uses rounding operations to reduce public key size. Proposed scheme offers a balance between security and efficiency. Key generation, encryption, and decryption operations requiring 1422, 1040, and 2647 CPU cycles respectively and execution times for these operations are approximately 68.965, 34.483, and 34.483μs. The scheme's security against chosen plaintext attacks is proven under the MLWR assumption. Security assessments using Martin Albrecht's estimator demonstrate that proposed parameter sets offer a high level of security (NIST's security categories) against Block Korkine–Zolotarev (BKZ) attacks. A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed PKE scheme has been conducted, focusing on its performance and security. The analysis includes a comparison with other lattice-based PKEs to highlight scheme's unique features and advantages. Performance of proposed PKE is comparable to existing efficient lattice-based alternatives, making it a compelling candidate for secure communication in the post-quantum era. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Unfortunately, attackers strike not only from outside the organization but also from within. Such internal attacks are called insider attacks or threats, and the people responsible for them are insider attackers or insider threat agents. Insider attacks pose more significant risks and can result in greater organizational losses than outsider attacks. Thus, every organization should be vigilant regarding such attackers to protect its valuable resources from harm. Finding solutions to protect organizations from such attacks is critical. Despite the importance of this topic, little research has been conducted on providing solutions to mitigate insider attacks. Objective: This study aims to develop an organizational readiness model to assess an organization's readiness for insider attacks. Method: We conducted a multivocal literature review to identify practices that can be used to assess organizations' readiness against insider attacks. These practices were grouped into different knowledge areas of insider attacks for organizations. The insider attack readiness model was developed using identified best practices and knowledge areas: compliance, top management, human resources, and technical. Results: This model was evaluated at two levels—academic and real-world environments. The evaluation results show that the proposed model can identify organizations' readiness against insider attacks. Conclusion: The proposed model can guide organizations through a secure environment against insider attacks. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

As a result, people are becoming more aware of the importance of network security. One of the primary concerns in ensuring security is the authority over domains, and network owners are striving to establish a common language to exchange security information and respond quickly to emerging threats. Given the increasing prevalence of various types of attacks, network security has become a significant challenge in the realm of computing. To address this, a multi-level distributed approach incorporating vulnerability identification, dimensioning, and countermeasures based on attack graphs has been developed. Implementing reconfigurable virtual systems as countermeasures significantly improves attack detection and mitigates the impact of attacks. Password-based authentication, for instance, can be susceptible to password cracking techniques, social engineering attacks, or data breaches that expose user credentials. Similarly, ensuring privacy during data transmission through encryption helps protect data from unauthorized access, but it does not guarantee the prevention of other types of attacks such as malware infiltration or insider threats. This research explores various techniques to achieve effective attack detection. Multiple research methods have been utilized and evaluated to identify the most suitable approach for network security and attack detection in the context of cloud computing. The analysis and implementation of diverse research studies demonstrate that the based signature intrusion detection method outperforms others in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, accuracy, reliability, and time complexity. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024."

In this paper, a five-dimensional grid multi-scroll chaotic system is established by introducing two multi-stable memristors into the Sprott A system. The resultant system has no equilibrium point and thus the generated multi-scroll attractors are hidden. The addition of the two multi-stable memristors can expand the original single scroll hidden attractor into a grid multi-scroll attractor. The generation mechanism of multi-scroll hidden attractors is discussed and it is found that the number of scrolls is determined by that of the stable equilibrium points of the two memristors. Thus, the number of scrolls in the multi-scroll hidden attractors can be easily controlled by adjusting the internal parameters of the multi-stable memristors. More importantly, the constructed memristive grid multi-scroll Sprott A system (MGSAS) exhibits initial-based offset enhancement in different directions and multi-scroll amplitude control behavior. Additionally, the coexistence of multiple multi-scroll hidden attractors is also observed and the number of the coexisting attractors is also dependent on that of the stable equilibrium points of the two multi-stable memristors. These interesting dynamic phenomena are examined in depth using nonlinear analysis tools. Finally, the feasibility of MGSAS is verified through Multisim circuit simulation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

To address these concerns, this paper introduces a novel, robust watermarking scheme using integer wavelet transform-singular value decomposition (IWT-SVD). The proposed scheme is divided into logo embedding and EPR text embedding, aiming to mitigate false-positive issues and maintain EPR integrity and authenticity. In the first part, medical image and watermark logo are encrypted using DMA (Diffused Mandelbrot set-Arnold map) to enhance security. Further, the encrypted medical image is segmented into four sub-bands (CA, CH, CV, CD) by one-level IWT transform. Then SVD is applied on sub-band CD to extract the principal component (PC), where the encrypted logo is embedded due to its higher magnitudes, thereby mitigating false-positive errors. Embedding the encrypted logo into the hybrid IWT-SVD domain enhances security and robustness. Moreover, for embedding, multiple optimal embedding factors (MOEFs) are determined through Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to balance imperceptibility and robustness. In the second part, EPR text is embedded into watermarked logo using SVD to verify authenticity. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated on standard medical image datasets against various attacks in terms of SSIM, PSNR, BER, and NC. The proposed scheme improves PSNR values by 48.44% and 19.66% for grayscale and color images, respectively. Similarly, NC values are also improved by 10%–12% for grayscale and color images. Therefore, the proposed scheme enhances security, imperceptibility, and robustness while reducing complexity compared to the state-of-the-art schemes. Moreover, it is also false-positive-free and maintain integrity simultaneously. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

In particular, the proposed L-LCCML system adopts cascade coupling parameter to ensure the dynamic effect of coupling. Therefore, L-LCCML has excellent chaos and is suitable for information encryption. To provide a more secure approach, the proposed algorithm contains two diffusion operations, one permutation operation, and does not require multiple rounds of encryption.

The existence of aggregation-induced fluorescence quenching effect，however，severely limits the application of carbon dots in the field of solid-state luminescence. The development of long wavelength red CDs in solid state has always been a difficult problem. Most long-wavelength red CDs display quenching phenomenon and single fluorescence emission，which greatly limits their utilization in the field of anti-counterfeiting. Therefore，in this study，an environmentally friendly and easy to prepare solid red fluorescent CDs（FD-CDs）was designed and synthesized by doping nitrogen and sulfur elements. Dithiosalicylic acid and formamide were used as raw materials，and acetic acid was used as solvent. The dual emission peak and aggregation induced emission characteristics of FD-CDs make it suitable for fingerprint detection，ink printing and anti-counterfeiting applications. The structural analysis shows that FD-CDs is spherical and evenly distributed. It is composed of surface functional groups containing nitrogen，sulfur and other elements as well as carbon graphite nuclei. FD-CDs exhibit blue emission in the dispersed state and red emission in the aggregated or powder state. FD-CDs solution has only one emission peak at 367 nm，while FD-CDs powder has double emission peaks at 482 nm and 612 nm. The fluorescence quantum yield of FD-CDs in solid state is as high as 41.01%，while that in solution state is only 17.68%，showing a typical phenomenon of aggregation induced enhanced emission. The structure and optical characterization indicate that the double emission of FD-CDs has different luminescence centers. In low concentration or dispersed state， FD-CDs only has short wavelength emission，which may be caused by carbon nucleus emission. With the increase of concentration，FD-CDs agglomerates，π - π accumulation occurs in carbon nuclei with large conjugated structure，and short-wavelength fluorescence is quenched，therefore blue emission is inhibited. When FD-CDs aggregates，the symmetric heterocycles induced by S-S bonds limit the intramolecular rotation，and the main surface energy transition will be converted to fluorescence，resulting in red emission. By further calculating the ratio of radiative and non-radiative transitions，the non-radiative transition channels of FD-CDs in powder state are significantly reduced. It is inferred that aggregation can inhibit the movement of surface groups，prevent the dissipation of energy，inhibit the non-radiative transition process，and significantly improve the fluorescence emission efficiency of FD-CDs. According to the unique double emission and aggregation induced emission effect，a double switch ink based on FD-CDs was designed. Apply the prepared FD-CDs solution to the “butterfly” filter paper with a glue head dropper. After the water evaporates，the overall “butterfly” appears red. The filter paper emits strong red fluorescence under ultraviolet irradiation at 365 nm. Then the surface of the“butterfly” was coated with anhydrous ethanol，and the red fluorescence disappeared and showed blue fluorescence. After the anhydrous ethanol volatilized，the water was coated again，the blue fluorescence disappeared，and the red fluorescence appeared again. The use of anticounterfeiting ink to print a pattern“two-dimensional code”on acid-free paper，in visible light，acid-free paper without any trace，and in 365 nm ultraviolet irradiation can see a red two-dimensional code pattern，with a smart phone scanning the two-dimensional code can be swept out of the official website of “Shaanxi University of Technology”. The excellent long wavelength red emission can also be used as fingerprint recognition，and the finger containing FD-CDs can be printed on the tape with a fingerprint pattern. Under 365 nm ultraviolet irradiation， the bifurcation， termination， island， eye， nucleus， cross and scar information on the fingerprint were clearly presented. © 2024 Chinese Optical Society.

Drawing inspiration from the renowned de Broglie-Bohm theory, we conceptualize nonlocal boxes as realistic systems featuring instantaneous signaling at the hidden-variable level. By introducing randomness into the distribution of the hidden variable, the superluminal signaling model is made compatible with the operational no-signaling condition. As our design mimics the famous symmetric key encryption system called the one-time pad (OTP), we call this the OTP model for nonlocal boxes. We illustrate the efficacy of this model through various esoteric examples related to the nonclassical nature of nonlocal boxes. In particular, the breakdown of communication complexity using nonlocal boxes can be better understood in this framework. Additionally, we delve into the Van Dam protocol, revealing its connection to homomorphic encryption studied in cryptography. Exploring potential avenues for encapsulating quantum-realizable nonlocal correlations within our framework, we highlight that the information causality principle imposes additional constraints at the hidden-variable level.

Users prove their identity by signing a challenge with a private key, which is stored on a device such as a cell phone or a USB security token. This approach avoids many of the common security problems with password-based authentication. WebAuthn’s reliance on proof-of-possession leads to a usability issue, however: a user who loses access to their authenticator device either loses access to their accounts or is required to fall back on a weaker authentication mechanism. To solve this problem, Yubico has proposed a protocol which allows a user to link two tokens in such a way that one (the primary authenticator) can generate public keys on behalf of the other (the backup authenticator). With this solution, users authenticate with a single token, only relying on their backup token if necessary for account recovery. However, Yubico’s protocol relies on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem for its security and hence is vulnerable to an attacker with a powerful enough quantum computer. We present a WebAuthn recovery protocol which can be instantiated with quantum-safe primitives. We also critique the security model used in previous analysis of Yubico’s protocol and propose a new framework which we use to evaluate the security of both the group-based and the quantum-safe protocol. This leads us to uncover a weakness in Yubico’s proposal which escaped detection in prior work but was revealed by our model. In our security analysis, we require the cryptographic primitives underlying the protocols to satisfy a number of novel security properties such as KEM unlinkability, which we formalize. We prove that well-known quantum-safe algorithms, including CRYSTALS-Kyber, satisfy the properties required for analysis of our quantum-safe protocol. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

SSE aims to support efficient Boolean query processing with optimal storage and search overhead over large real databases. However, current constructions in the literature lack the support for multi-client search and dynamic updates to the encrypted databases, which are essential requirements for the widespread deployment of SSE on real cloud infrastructures. Trivially extending a state-of-the-art single client dynamic construction, such as ODXT (Patranabis et al., NDSS’21), incurs significant leakage that renders such extension insecure in practice. Currently, no SSE construction in the literature offers efficient multi-client query processing and search with dynamic updates over large real databases while maintaining a benign leakage profile. This work presents the first dynamic multi-client SSE scheme Nomos supporting efficient multi-client conjunctive Boolean queries over an encrypted database. Precisely, Nomos is a multi-readersingle-writer construction that allows only the gate-keeper (or the data-owner) - a trusted entity in the Nomos framework, to update the encrypted database stored on the adversarial server. Nomos achieves forward and type-II backward privacy of dynamic SSE constructions while incurring lesser leakage than the trivial extension of ODXT to a multi-client setting. Furthermore, our construction is practically efficient and scalable - attaining linear encrypted storage and sublinear search overhead for conjunctive Boolean queries. We provide an experimental evaluation of software implementation over an extensive real dataset containing millions of records. The results show that Nomos performance is comparable to the state-of-the-art static conjunctive SSE schemes in practice. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

In this study, four metal-free carbon dots (CDs) are developed through structural tailoring, and panchromatic high-brightness RTP is achieved via strong chemical encapsulation in urea. The maximum lifetime and quantum yield reaches 2141 ms and 56.55%, respectively. Moreover, CDs-IV@urea, prepared via coreshell interaction engineering, exhibits a dual afterglow of red RTP and green TADF. The degree of conjugation and functional groups of precursors affects the binding interactions of the nitrogen cladding on CDs, which in turn stabilizes triplet energy levels and affects the energy gap between S1 and T1 (ΔEST) to induce multicolor RTP. The enhanced wrapping interaction lowers the ΔEST, promoting reverse intersystem crossing, which leads to phosphorescence and TADF. This strong coreshell interaction fully stabilizes the triplet state, thus stabilizing the material in water, even in extreme environments such as strong acids and oxidants. These afterglow materials are tested in multicolor, time, and temperature multiencryption as well as in multicolor in vivo bioimaging. Hence, these materials have promising practical applications in information security as well as biomedical diagnosis and treatment. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

The pH-responsive PDMAEMA brush undergoes protonation at a low pH value (pH < 6), which induces different swelling degrees in response to pH and thus refractive index and thickness change of the insulator layer of the MIM FP cavity. This leads to significant optical property changes in transmission and a distinguishable color change spanning the whole visible region by adjusting the pH value of the external environment. Due to the reversible conformational change of the PDMAEMA and the formation of covalent bonds between the PDMAEMA molecular chain and the Ag substrate, the MIM FP cavity exhibits stable performance and good reproducibility.

Therefore, to guarantee the dependability of data transmission in the IoV environment, this paper designs a blind signature scheme for IoV based on two-dimensional sine cosine cross-chaotic mapping (2D-SCML) image encryption and lattice cipher (BSS-IoV). The innovation of this scheme is that it aims at blind signature of image information, blinds it before sending the information, and combines the lattice public key encryption algorithm to better ensure the safe and reliable transmission of information and reduce the risk of information disclosure. To further ensure the security of the scheme, an image encryption algorithm based on 2D-SCML and pixel splitting (2PS-IEA) is proposed, which is used to blind the information and thus reduce the risk of information leakage on the one hand, on the other hand, it is used in the signature process to ensure the security of the signed information. The 2D-SCML is derived from the cross-model structure proposed in this paper. Through simulation results and experimental analysis, the values of NPCR and UACI, respectively, 99.6094% and 33.4635%, are close to ideal values. And 50% of the cut image can also recover the rough information, which indicates that the signature scheme has the security against differential attacks, cut attacks and noise attacks. Moreover, the security analysis shows that the scheme has the anti-tamper, anti-repudiation and traceability. © 2024 The Author(s)"

The motivation is clear: robust quantum computers, once available, will render current cryptographic standards vulnerable. Thus, we need new Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms, and, due to the inherent complexity of such algorithms, there is also a demand to accelerate them in hardware. In this paper, we show that PQC hardware accelerators can be backdoored by two different adversaries located in the chip supply chain. We propose REPQC, a sophisticated reverse engineering algorithm that can be employed to confidently identify hashing operations (i.e., Keccak) within the PQC accelerator – the location of which serves as an anchor for finding secret information to be leaked. Armed with REPQC, an adversary proceeds to insert malicious logic in the form of a stealthy Hardware Trojan Horse (HTH). Using Dilithium as a study case, our results demonstrate that HTHs that increase the accelerator’s layout density by as little as 0.1% can be inserted without any impact on the performance of the circuit and with a marginal increase in power consumption. An essential aspect is that the entire reverse engineering in REPQC is automated, and so is the HTH insertion that follows it, empowering adversaries to explore multiple HTH designs and identify the most suitable one. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

Unfortunately, the complicated synthesis process and poor stability limit its practical applications, hence there is an urgent need to develop a feasible fabrication process for films to attain high device performance. Herein, a molecular level hybridization of bridged polysilsesquioxane (BPSQ) is designed as matrix to harvest both flexibility of organics and stability of inorganics, resulting in improved interfacial compatibility between the CsPbBr3 QDs and the matrix through chemical bond anchoring. The CsPbBr3@3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTES)@BPSQ films showcase bright narrow-band photoluminescence, with a photoluminescence quantum yield of 61% and a half-peak full width at half maximum of <17 nm. Notably, these films demonstrate excellent environmental stability, UV resistance, water stability (experiencing only an 18% decrease in luminescence intensity after 168 h of water immersion), and high-temperature stability (withstanding temperatures up to 500 K). Furthermore, white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) and anti-counterfeiting patterns have been fabricated using CsPbBr3@APTES@BPSQ, highlighting their wide application potential in flexible light-emitting devices and information encryption. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

A base scrambling pseudo random binary sequence (PRBS) generated by the ZUC stream cipher is introduced, which results in a better scrambling effect and randomness in the key stream of the block encryption structure. A simulation setup conducted in an encrypted transmission of the 64×64 grayscale image over 80 km of optical fiber shows that the authorized user can successfully decrypt the received signal, while the eavesdroppers cannot derive useful information with a bit error rate (BER) at approximately 0.5.

When the lifetime of the secret data is on the order of decades to centuries, the threat of improved cryptanalysis casts doubt on the long-term security of cryptographic techniques, which rely on hardness assumptions that are hard to prove over archival time scales. This threat makes the design of secure archival systems exceptionally difficult. Some archival systems turn a blind eye to this issue, hoping that current cryptographic techniques will not be broken; others often use techniques - -such as secret sharing - -that are impractical at scale.

Multi-level stimuli-responsive luminescent materials with internal logical relationship can improve the degree of anti-counterfeiting and resist against the flood of counterfeiting. In this work, we propose to use force and acid dual stimuli to restrict the dissipation path of photogenerated free radicals, which further lead to the radical-actuated photochromic luminescence (PCL) performance. Based on this strategy, a zero-dimensional (0D) dinuclear zinc complex Zn2(9-AC)4(IM)2 (1) with blue luminescent properties (450 nm) was designed and synthesized. The interaction between 9-AC and IM (as 9-AC/IM exciplex) can be cut off by force-induced rearrangement of structural units in the spatial dimensions or acid-induced protonation of 9-AC, achieving the luminescent transformation from 9-AC/IM exciplex (447 nm) to 9-AC/9-AC excimer (480 nm) or 9-HAC (485 nm). At the same time, the PCL performance was activated and the emission intensity quenching rate increased from 4.77 % to 93.86 % or 44.93 % under UV light irradiation, respectively. The solid-state ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra, electron paramagnetic resonance spectra and theoretical calculation confirmed that the activation of PCL performance is due to the fact that the 9-AC• radicals are more difficult to dissipate upon force- or acid-induced stimuli. Combining mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) and PCL, a dynamic anti-counterfeiting quick response (QR) code with multi-level and fast-responsive logic sequence have been designed, which are promising for the application in time-resolved information encryption. This work provides an effective strategy to construct multi-level stimuli-responsive luminescence as novel anti-counterfeiting materials by changing the photogenerated free radical dissipation pathway to activate PCL properties. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Herein, a time-dependent information encryption model from a liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) film with a programmable glass transition temperature (Tg) and gradually adjustable fluorescence is demonstrated. The programmable Tg is achieved by adjusting the degree of order of the LC molecules via a configuration interconversion of spiropyran-based materials (SPBMs), which can convert between a V-shaped colorless spiro (SP) and a rodlike dark-colored merocyanine (MC) form. An LCP film obtained by visible light polymerization exhibits a lower Tg than UV light, because the SPBM molecules keep different configurations in the two films. By adjusting the ratio of two isomerization forms of SPBM molecules during the polymerization process, the Tg values of LCP films can change from 11.6 °C to 31.1 °C. Based on the isomerization rate of SPBM in the LCP films with different Tg, time-dependent information encryption is successfully achieved. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

However, most metasurface-based encryption techniques rely on limited decoding keys and struggle to achieve multidimensional complex encryption. It hinders the progress of optical storage capacity and puts encryption security at a disclosing risk. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a multidimensional encryption system based on chip-integrated metasurfaces that successfully incorporates the simultaneous manipulation of three-dimensional optical parameters, including wavelength, direction, and polarization. Hence, up to eight-channel augmented reality (AR) holograms are concealed by near- and far-field fused encryption, which can only be extracted by correctly providing the three-dimensional decoding keys and then vividly exhibit to the authorizer with low crosstalk, high definition, and no zero-order speckle noise.

However, its limitation lies in processing only those elements present in every participant’s set, which proves inadequate in scenarios where certain elements are common to several, but not all, sets. In this paper, we introduce an innovative variant of the mPSI protocol named unbalanced quorum PSI to fill in the gaps of the mPSI protocol. Unlike the previous quorum-PSI proposals which detect elements present in at least k out of n equal sets, our protocol is particularly tailored for unbalanced cases where the size of the receiver’s set is much smaller than the size of the senders’ sets. Our work achieves logarithmic communication complexity in the semi-honest setting, significantly surpassing previous work in efficiency. The benchmarks show that it takes 22.7 seconds in WAN and 14.7 seconds in LAN for online computation, and only 87.8 MB of total communication to intersect 5535 elements across 15 sets, each containing 224 elements. Compared to prior work, this is roughly an 87× reduction in communication and a 31× reduction in online time. Our protocols can be easily extended to the larger set with 228 elements which is nearly impractical for prior work. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

The proposal weakens the high trust placed on the centralized tracing party in previous group signatures by decentralizing tracing power using a multiple tracer setting and limiting the tracers' access using attribute-based encryption and the requirement of the group manager's agreement. We allow the group manager to control tracers identifying his group users. Instead of a centralized tracer, our setting has multiple tracers possessing attribute sets. Thus, after getting the group manager's permission, a tracer should satisfy the access policy in a given signature to identify the signer. On the other hand, our group signature scheme decentralizes the tracing key generation and removes the group manager's tracing ability. Thus, it ensures that only the attribute-satisfying and permitted tracers can identify the signer. Moreover, this article delivers security against malicious users. It presents a verification process of access policy of the signatures to prevent users from utilizing invalid attributes for signing. In addition, the article delivers a collaborative tracing mechanism to satisfy attribute sets that a tracer fails to fulfill alone for identifying a signer.

Nevertheless, the majority of these materials currently have limited capability for regulating the afterglow color in only one direction. Here, a metal-organic coordination polymer (Zn-PTZ-O) is presented that demonstrates the ability to modulate its afterglow color in a circular modulation pathway. As the temperature increases from 77 to 400 K, the afterglow color red-shifts from blue to green, and then blue-shifts back to blue, achieving circular modulation. This outstanding phenomenon is attributed to the concurrence of long-lived thermally activated delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence emission of Zn-PTZ-O. Furthermore, the afterglow color of Zn-PTZ-O also has forward and reverse excitation wavelength dependence at 77 K and room temperature, respectively. As the excitation wavelength increases from 340 to 460 nm at 77 K, the afterglow color of Zn-PTZ-O red-shifts from blue to yellow. While as the excitation wavelength increases from 375 to 410 nm at room temperature, the afterglow color blue-shifts from yellowish-green to blue, almost forming another color-changing circle. This work provides a good idea for the design of color-tunable long-lived organic materials. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

Once these data are compromised, it leads to privacy breaches. Therefore, how to ensure identity security in the metaverse environment has become an urgent problem to be solved. Although research on identity authentication schemes can help improve identity security, traditional identity authentication schemes in network environments are studied based on their own environmental characteristics, which makes it difficult to meet the security needs in the metaverse environment. As a result, in this paper we propose an elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based identity authentication scheme to address identity authentication issues in the metaverse environment. This scheme ensures secure communication among users, avatars, and platform servers. The security of this scheme was demonstrated through informal security analysis and the automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) formal security analysis tools, and the results showed that it can resist various known attacks.

ID-AKE has the advantage that certificate management is unnecessary, and the authentication can be based on the party's public ID, such as an e-mail address. In this paper, we propose the first tightly secure ID-AKE scheme in the standard model. First, we extend the security model of Han et al.'s PKI-based AKE to the security model for ID-AKE. Next, we introduce a generic construction with multi-user secure KEM and ID-based signature (IBS) as building blocks and prove the tight security in our security model. For instantiating the underlying IBS, we also revisit the security proof of the existing generic construction of tightly secure IBS proposed by Lee et al.

This evolution has created a demand for lightweight implementations of cryptographic primitives to meet the specific requirements and resource-constraints of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). In the present paper we introduce Curve2065, a new elliptic curve in Montgomery form for x-coordinate-only ECDH key exchange between devices equipped with an 8/16/32-bit microcontroller. As its name indicates, Curve2065 is based on the 206-bit prime field Fp given by p = 2206-5, a pseudo-Mersenne prime that enables fast modular arithmetic. Concretely, Curve2065 is defined by the equation EA: (A + 2)y2 = x3 + Ax2 + x where A =-(4/91681 + 2) and offers a security level of 102 bits. The curve parameter A was chosen so that EA is birationally-equivalent to an Edwards curve with a small parameter d to enable fast key-pair generation. Even though A is not small, the Montgomery ladder on Curve2065 is exactly as efficient as on Bernstein's Curve25519. We describe an implementation of Curve2065 for ECDH key exchange based on a ""lightweight""(i.e., size-optimized) Fp-Arithmetic library for the TI MSP430(X) family of 16-bit microcontrollers. Our simulation results show that a variable-base scalar multiplication using the Montgomery ladder on Curve2065 takes 7.22 · 106 clock cycles on an MSP430F1611 target, while a fixed-base scalar multiplication with eight precomputed points on an isogenous twisted Edwards curve can be executed in only 2.96 · 106 cycles. © 2024 ACM."

However, it remains challenging to achieve multistage secure information encryption due to the limited stimulus responsiveness and color tunability of the current dual-mode materials. Herein, a dual-mode hydrogel with both independently tunable structural and fluorescent colors toward multistage information encryption, is reported. In this hydrogel system, the rigid lamellar structure of poly(dodecylglyceryl itaconate) (pDGI) formed by shear flow-induced self-assembly provides the restricted domains wherein monomers undergo polymerization to form a hydrogel network, producing structural color. The introduction of fluorescent monomer 6-acrylamidopicolinate (6APA) as a complexation site provides the possibility of fluorescent color formation. The hydrogel's angle-dependent structural color can be controlled by adjusting the crosslinking density and water content. Additionally, the fluorescence color can be modulated by adjusting the ratio of lanthanide ions. Information of dual-mode can be displayed separately in different channels and synergistically overlayed to read the ultimate message. Thus, a multistage information encryption system based on this hydrogel is devised through the programed decryption process.

However, traditional DApps leveraging off-chain storage face performance challenges due to factors such as storage location, network speed, and hardware conditions.

Aiming to enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) in DApps built on blockchain technology, this paper proposes a blockchain node-based distributed caching architecture that guarantees real-time responsiveness for users. The proposed architecture ensures data integrity and user data ownership through blockchain while maintaining cache data consistency through local blockchain data. By implementing local cache clusters on blockchain nodes, our system achieves rapid response times. Additionally, attribute-based encryption is applied to stored content, enabling secure content sharing and access control, which prevents data leakage and unauthorized access in unreliable off-chain storage environments. Comparative analysis shows that our proposed system achieves a reduction in request processing latency of over 89% compared to existing off-chain solutions, maintaining cache data consistency and achieving response times within 65 ms.

Nevertheless, the intricate design of anisotropic nanostructures forming a polarization multiplexed metasurface poses a significant challenge, increasing the requirements for manufacturing processes and diminishing overall robustness. Herein, we present a minimalist metasurface comprised of only two kinds of nanostructures to achieve the integration of continuous-amplitude modulated nanoprinting and eight-step phase-only helicity-multiplexed holography. Specifically, the nanoprinting image governed by Malus’s law can be observed in the orthogonally polarized light path, while holographic images can be switched by changing the chirality of the incident circularly polarized light. More importantly, the geometric phase and the propagation phase of the metasurface are optimized simultaneously according to the target images. Thus, the metasurface does not require optimizing many kinds of nanostructures to achieve the phase but only needs two kinds of nanostructures, forming a minimalist metasurface that significantly relieves the design and fabrication burden. Moreover, the proposed methodology is universal and applicable not only in polarization multiplexing but also in other multi-channel multiplexing technologies.

However, existing algorithms have limitations, such as low embedding capacity and insufficient privacy protection. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an RDH-EI scheme based on adaptive median edge detection (AMED) and matrix-based secret sharing (MSS). The algorithm creatively leverages the AMED technique for precise image prediction and then integrates the (r, n)-threshold MSS scheme to partition the image into n encrypted images. Simultaneously, it embeds identifying information during segmentation to detect potential attacks during transmission. The algorithm allows multiple data hiders to embed secret data independently. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the embedding rate while preserving reversibility compared to current algorithms. The average maximum embedding rates achieved are up to 5.8142 bits per pixel (bpp) for the (3, 4)-threshold scheme and up to 7.2713 bpp for the (6, 6)-threshold scheme.

While extensively studied in solutions, AIE’s potential on solid surfaces remains largely unexplored, which can be fundamentally interesting and practically useful. In this work, we demonstrate the successful dispersion of tetraphenylethylene (TPE), one of the most classical AIE luminogens, on solid surfaces coated with silicone nanofilaments (SNF). The high surface area of SNF enables the uniform immobilization of TPE luminogens, replicating their dispersal behavior in solutions. Compared to unmodified surfaces, TPE dispersed on SNF-coated surfaces exhibits significantly enhanced fluorescence intensity. Moreover, a fascinating dynamic blue shift in TPE emission on SNF-coated surfaces is observed, with the velocity controllable by the surface group of SNF by up to 4 orders of magnitude, showing that TPE can be applied to the judgment of the nanoscale morphology and surface free energy of the solid surface. Owing to the superhydrophobicity and self-cleaning properties of SNF, the on-surface fluorescence can be sustained underwater and is resistant to dust contamination and rain erosion, with potential applications of information encryption presented. Our approach of uniformly dispersing AIE luminogens on nanomaterials with high surface areas provides a general methodology for creating on-surface fluorescence and saving the usage of expensive AIE luminogens in applications. © 2024 American Chemical Society."

Searchable encryption can protect data from leaking and retain the search functionality over encrypted data simultaneously. Although there are many followed works on the expressive query and higher security, the keyword guessing attack(KGA)is one of the problems to be more explored. The keyword guessing attack makes adversaries infer the meaning of keyword ciphertext, so data privacy is compromised by leaking users’ search preferences even the personal information of data receivers. Therefore, it is very meaningful and important to solve the keyword guessing attack problem. Specifically, pay more attention to how to solve the offline keyword guessing attack against internal adversaries under the fact that the research of resisting offline keyword guessing attacks against external adversaries has become mature gradually. In this paper, we expound on the mechanism of an internal keyword guessing attack, that is, the cloud server can test whether the keyword ciphertext and the trapdoor match at will. Then, we summarize and compare the solutions against internal keyword guessing attack in recent years. More specifically, there are five kinds of solutions on the dual-server model, authentication server model, witness keywords model, designated sender model, and fuzzy keywords model respectively. Then, we point out that the general way to solve internal keyword guessing attacks is by hindering ability of the server to generate ciphertext, get trapdoor, and run test algorithms independently. Moreover, resistance to internal keyword guessing attack should be a basic attribute of the public key searchable encryption scheme. Finally, left problems on internal keyword guessing attacks and further works are discussed. It is helpful to further solve the internal keyword guessing attack problem in the public key searchable encryption, so that the public key searchable protocol is used in practice. © 2024 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Federated learning enables vehicles to collaboratively train a global model without sharing sensitive local data, thereby mitigating privacy risks. However, the dynamic and open nature of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) makes it vulnerable to potential attacks, where attackers may intercept or tamper with transmitted local model parameters, compromising their integrity and exposing user privacy. Although existing solutions like differential privacy and encryption can address these issues, they may reduce data usability or increase computational complexity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a conditional privacy-preserving identity-authentication scheme, CPPA-SM2, to provide privacy protection for federated learning. Unlike existing methods, CPPA-SM2 allows vehicles to participate in training anonymously, thereby achieving efficient privacy protection. Performance evaluations and experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art schemes, CPPA-SM2 significantly reduces the overhead of signing, verification and communication while achieving more security features. © 2024 by the authors."

In this paper, we study card-based cryptographic protocols for symmetric functions f: {0, 1}n → R, where R is an arbitrary finite set. Any symmetric Boolean function has the property that its output value is determined only by the sum of input bits, and the class of them includes many interesting functions such as the AND and equality functions. In 2020, Ruangwises and Itoh proposed a protocol which uses 2n + 2 cards to securely compute any symmetric function f: {0, 1}n → R; reducing the number of cards to less than 2n + 2 was left as an open problem. While the Ruangwises-Itoh protocol uses a two-colored deck of cards, this paper considers using three-colored and four-colored decks: To give a partial answer to the open problem, we propose three protocols for symmetric functions using 2n + 1 cards or less. Specifically, we first propose a protocol using 2n + 1 cards from a three-colored deck.

Nonetheless, these potential solutions are constrained by inherent drawbacks, including the need for additional error correction circuits or algorithms, heightened susceptibility to environmental interference, and limited data density. This paper demonstrates the extremely high-density, physical-unclonable cryptographic keys by harnessing stochastically ferroelectric domain polarizations in Aurivillius ferroelectric material CaBi2Nb2O9 (CBNO). Ferroelectric polarization of CBNO nanodomains can serve as a robust source of physical unclonable entropy. Through the application of high-speed voltage pulses, the inherent randomness of ferroelectric polarizations can be enhanced, thereby yielding cryptographic keys characterized by remarkable uniformity, uniqueness, and negligible environmental sensitivity. More importantly, the voltage pulse operations facilitate the configurability of the ferroelectric cryptographic keys with no correlation. An unprecedented data density of 435 Gbit µm−2 is therefore achievable with a miniaturized CBNO of less than 1 um2. Notably, the reconfigured keys successfully pass the National Institute of Standards and Technology random number tests without requiring additional post-processing steps. Emanating from the inherent attributes of the material, these high-density ferroelectric keys confer intrinsic advantages to information security, evincing substantial resistance to duplication or cloning. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

In the growing space of digital credentials, accumulators are used to manage sets of valid credentials, giving efficient and anonymous methods for credential holders to prove their validity. Unlike traditional credentials like digital signatures, one can easily revoke credentials with an accumulator; however, each revocation forces existing credential holders to engage in an expensive update process. Previous works make this faster and easier by sacrificing anonymity. To improve performance without compromising privacy, we present ALLOSAUR, a multi-party accumulator based on pairings. In ALLOSAUR, we eliminate the cost of accumulating new credentials, let “credential managers” manage the accumulator values with secure multiparty computation, and allow anonymous credential updates with a square-root reduction in communication costs as compared to existing work. A deployed digital credential system is a vast and complicated system, and existing formalisms do not fully address the scope or power of a real-world adversary. We develop a thorough “UC-style” formalism that allows arbitrary malicious behaviour from an adversary controlling a minority of credential managers and arbitrary numbers of users, credentials, and verifiers. In our new formalism we present a novel definition of privacy that captures as much anonymity as possible while accounting for inevitable losses from interaction with the system. The detail in our formalism reveals real-world issues in existing accumulator constructions, all of which ALLOSAUR avoids. The typical bottleneck in accumulator-based digital credential systems is handling revocations of credentials. Our proof-of-concept implementation of ALLOSAUR can update over 1000 revocations with less than half a second of total computation and 16 kB communication, which is at least a 5x improvement over the previous state-of-the-art in both metrics. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

Quantum computing attacks also pose a threat to its security. Targeting these issues, we design and propose a blockchain copyright protection scheme based on attribute-based encryption (ABE). In this scheme, the security advantages of blockchain technology are utilized to ensure the authenticity and integrity of copyright data. Based on lattice cryptography and the decision ring learning with errors (R-LWE) problem, a new ABE algorithm that supports searchable ciphertext and policy updates is designed. Then, we introduce it into the blockchain copyright protection scheme, which enables secure access to copyright data and fine-grained control. In addition, the lattice cryptography can strengthen this scheme against quantum attacks. Through security analysis, our scheme can prove to be secure against adaptive chosen keyword attacks, selective chosen plaintext attacks, and adaptive chosen policy attacks in the random oracle model. More importantly, the comparison analysis and experimental results show that our proposed approach has lower computation costs and storage costs.

The importance of medical health records privacy is increasing as these records are shared in cloud environments. In this paper, we propose an enhanced system for securing patient data (Medical Health Records) embedded in multiple medical images in fragments for secure transmission and public sharing on the cloud or other environments. To protect the patient’s privacy, Medical Records are first encrypted, and then the ciphertext is broken into several fragments based on the number of multimodal medical images of a patient. A key generator randomly selects medical images from the multimodal image data to embed the encrypted patient health record segment using a modified least significant bit embedding process. The proposed technique enables an extra layer of security as even if files fall into the wrong hands and a fragment of the file is decrypted, it will not present any understandable information until all fragments from other medical images are extracted and combined in the correct order. The experiments are performed using multimodal 3255 MRI scans of 21 patients. The robustness of the proposed method was measured using different metrics such as PSNR, MSE, and SSIM. The results show that the proposed system is robust and that image quality is also maintained. To further study the stego image quality, a deep learning-based classification was applied to the images, and the results show that the diagnosis using stego medical images and performance remains unaffected even after embedding the encrypted data. © 2024 by the authors."

Then, an adaptive mean predictor is proposed to cooperate with ACNNP. According to these two predictors, a two-stage prediction and embedding model is designed to further enhance the embedding capacity and make data embedding more flexible. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits a high embedding capacity and reversibility when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

The game is intended for students who do not necessarily have any prior background in computer science. Assuming the role of agents, two players exchange messages over a network to try to agree on a meeting time and location, while an adversary interferes with their plan. Following the Dolev-Yao model, the adversary has full control of the network: they can see all messages and modify, block, or forward them. We designed the game as a web application, where groups of three students play the game, taking turns being the adversary. The adversary is a legitimate communicant on the network, and the agents do not know who is the other agent and who is the adversary. Through gameplay, we expect students to be able to (1) identify the dangers of communicating through a computer network, (2) describe the capabilities of a Dolev-Yao adversary, and (3) apply three cryptographic primitives: symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and digital signatures. We conducted surveys, focus groups, and interviews to evaluate the effectiveness of the game in achieving the learning objectives.

Advances in the utilization of these materials depend on the development of suitable fabrication techniques to create 3D architectures composed of PQD–polymer for sophisticated optoelectronics. This study introduces a straightforward and effective method for producing 3D architectures of PQD-encapsulated high-performance composites (PQD-HPCs) through direct-ink writing (DIW). This method employs an ink composed of prefabricated PQDs and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) in dichloromethane (DCM). HPC, an appropriate organic-soluble polymer, exhibits optical transparency in the highly volatile DCM and enables the formulation of a stable, room-temperature extrudable ink. The architectures, which are printed by adjusting the halide ratios (Cl, Br, and I) for the compositions of CH3NH3PbBr1.5I1.5, CH3NH3PbBr3, and CH3NH3PbBr1.5Cl1.5, exhibit single peak photoluminescence emissions of red (639 nm), green (515 nm), and blue (467 nm). Optimizing the printing parameters of DIW enables the precise fabrication of programmed and complex PQD-HPC 3D architectures for advanced anti-counterfeiting and information encryption. This method has the potential to enhance the functionality of modern printed electronic devices significantly. © 2024 The Authors. Advanced Functional Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH."

In this work, reversible coloration of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) film is demonstrated by alternate ultrafast (UF) laser and continuous wave (CW) laser irradiation. Under UF laser irradiation, oxygen vacancies are introduced in the TiO2 lattice, which lead to the bandgap reduction (2.73 to 1.50 eV) and surface blackening. The blackened area can achieve high resolution with size down to ≈1.1 µm. This coloration in TiO2 also shows excellent thermal stability that color fading is negligible even after thermal annealing at 700 K for 2 h in air. The generated high temperature by CW irradiation is known to be beneficial for the O2 dissociation on defected TiO2, thus promoting the internal oxygen diffusion to eliminate the vacancies. The energy band structure of TiO2 can be recovered accordingly, and decoloration is achieved. TiO2-NPs film shows stable microstructures with barely changed optical properties after 12 cycles of coloration–decoloration process. This band engineering-induced reversible coloration can also be applicable for broad oxides, e.g., ZnO, HfO2, and Ga2O3. Such highly stable and reversible coloration is promising in high-performance micro/nano-devices development for color display and optical encryption. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

Simultaneously, lack of security and poor energy efficiency is considered the major concerns in many routing protocols in various existing WSN protocols. Security and energy efficiency concerns are mainly due to the emergence of various kinds of malicious attacks because of advancements in networking technology. To mitigate these issues secured transmission is essential in any routing protocol. In order to provide safe data transfer in WSN-based smart environment applications, the TABEESR protocol (Trust Analysis Based Energy Efficient and Safe Routing) was developed. The proposed routing protocol encompasses four phases such as network creation and node deployment, grading for trust evaluation, route identification process and data transmission. The trust evaluation is performed with the aid of sensor packet features to categorize the positive nodes and negative nodes. The path identification process includes two processes such as cluster head selection through red fox optimization and relay node selection using a fuzzy interference system for energy efficient and secure path selection. A public static agreement key based cryptography technique is introduced for secure data transmission. The proposed TABEESR is tested with MATLAB software to validate its performance. SMEER, SHER, SRPA and AFSA are the prior routing protocols in WSN that are considered to compare the performance of the proposed routing protocol. The proposed TABEESR algorithm attained 95(%) of Average Residual Energy, 91 (%) of packet delivery ratio, 1350 (sec) network lifetime, 0.131 (Mbps) of throughput and 7(%) Packet Loss. Moreover, the proposed PSAKC algorithm attained 5.8 (%) information loss, 3.8 (sec) encryption time, 2.3 (sec) decryption time, 6 (sec) execution time, and 6.5 (J) energy consumption which is better than the prior methods. The proposed routing algorithm is applicable for providing security in both server to device and device to device in various smart applications. © 2024"

Lattice-based cryptography can withstand quantum computing attacks, making it a viable substitute for the currently prevalent classical public-key cryptography technique. However, the algorithm’s significant time complexity places a substantial computational burden on the already resource-limited chip in the IoT terminal. In lattice-based cryptography algorithms, the polynomial multiplication on the finite field is well known as the most time-consuming process. Therefore, investigations into efficient methods for calculating polynomial multiplication are essential for adopting these quantum-resistant lattice-based algorithms on a low-profile IoT terminal. Number theoretic transform (NTT), a variant of fast Fourier transform (FFT), is a technique widely employed to accelerate polynomial multiplication on the finite field to achieve a subquadratic time complexity. This study presents an efficient FPGA-based implementation of number theoretic transform for the CRYSTAL Kyber, a lattice-based public-key cryptography algorithm. Our hybrid design, which supports both forward and inverse NTT, is able run at high frequencies up to 417 MHz on a low-profile Artix7-XC7A100T and achieve a low latency of (Formula presented.) s while achieving state-of-the-art hardware efficiency, consuming only 541-LUTs, 680 FFs, and four 18 Kb BRAMs. This is made possible thanks to the newly proposed multilevel pipeline butterfly unit architecture in combination with employing an effective coefficient accessing pattern. © 2024 by the authors."

However, challenges persist in achieving simultaneous enhancement of multiple functionalities in artificial skin. Inspired by the unique structure of the skin, a two-step process involving ion diffusion-induced and strong-weak topological crosslinking is synergistically employed to fabricate a bilayer gradient hydrogel. Zn2+ initially diffuses to induce the formation of weak bonds, imparting elasticity. Subsequently, Fe3+/Zn2+ diffusion constructs a strong-weak topologically crosslinked network, enhancing the toughness of the gel while reducing the brittleness associated with robust bonds. Due to its distinctive design, the gel employs an adaptive energy dissipation strategy subjected to large and small stress, ensuring high sensitivity (3.31 kPa−1, 0–2 kPa), wide sensing range (0.4–40.6 kPa), and exceptional stability (500 cycles). This flexible approach enables programmable design in three dimensions, including ion diffusion type, direction, and shape. This gel can detect the gentle brushing of feathers and human body movements. It utilizes significant differences generated by magnitudes of stress to perform binary information encryption.

This strategy not only enables the creation of novel Ag-PONb composite nanoclusters but also facilitates the synthesis of stable low-nuclearity AgNCs.

The crystalline Ag8@Nb162 is stable under ambient conditions, What's more, it is water-soluble and able to maintain its molecular cluster structure intact in water. Further, the stable small [Ag8]6+ AgNC has interesting temperature- and pH-dependent reversible fluorescence response, based on which a multiple optical encryption mode for anti-counterfeit technology was demonstrated.

However, the application of current artificial muscle-based textiles in wearable and engineering fields has largely remained a constraint due to the limited deformation, restrictive stimulation, and uncomfortable. Here, dual-responsive yarn muscles with high contractile actuation force are fabricated by incorporating a very small fraction (<1 wt.%) of Ti3C2Tx MXene/cellulose nanofibers (CNF) composites into self-plied and twisted wool yarns. They can lift and lower a load exceeding 3400 times their own weight when stimulated by moisture and photothermal. Furthermore, the yarn muscles are coiled homochirally or heterochirally to produce spring-like muscles, which generated over 550% elongation or 83% contraction under the photothermal stimulation. The actuation mechanism, involving photothermal/moisture-mechanical energy conversion, is clarified by a combination of experiments and finite element simulations. Specifically, MXene/CNF composites serve as both photothermal and hygroscopic agents to accelerate water evaporation under near-infrared (NIR) light and moisture absorption from ambient air. Due to their low-cost facile fabrication, large scalable dimensions, and robust strength coupled with dual responsiveness, these soft actuators are attractive for intelligent textiles and devices such as self-adaptive textiles, soft robotics, and wearable information encryption. © 2024 The Authors.

In addition to that we will talk about the applications like quantum teleportation and cryptography which utilizes the quantum computers, and discuss about the future enhancements which can be done using this technology. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

However, this approach also poses substantial challenges to content monitoring and the regulation of potentially harmful broadcasts. Traditional techniques for the identification of encrypted video streams typically utilize TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) header information and the transmission mode of HTTP/1. 1 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 1. 1), extracting sequences of application-layer audio and video data unit lengths to recognize video content. However, the evolution of Internet protocols, notably with the adoption of the UDP (User Datagram Protocol)-based QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) protocol and its subsequent implementation in HTTP/3 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 3), has made these traditional methods inadequate. HTTP/3 significantly differs from its predecessors by lacking similar header information as TCP, using multiplexing to handle multiple data streams simultaneously, and encrypting nearly all transmitted data. These changes, along with the adoption of segmented and merged distribution strategies by video platforms, complicate the accurate identification of encrypted video content from network traffic. The necessity for new methods to tackle these challenges led to the development of the approach detailed in this paper, which capitalizes on specific control information characteristics within the HTTP/3 protocol. Our method focuses on extracting and refining data transmission features from HTTP/3 encrypted video streams, enabling the reconstruction of application-layer audio and video length characteristics. This reconstruction is crucial for identifying video content accurately. To handle the challenges posed by segmented merging distribution, we developed a key-value database that utilizes a plaintext fingerprint library. This database design facilitates rapid video identification by quickly matching incoming encrypted video data against stored fingerprints. Experimental validation of our method was conducted using a comprehensive dataset comprising 362, 502 real video fingerprints from YouTube. The results show that our method achieves nearly 99% accuracy, 100% precision, and 99. 32% Fl score. These metrics attest to the robustness and reliability of our technique. Further experiments on Facebook, where padding frames are commonly introduced during transmission, demonstrated commendable performance within a large-scale fingerprint database containing 283, 895 real video fingerprints. Specifically, our method achieved a notable accuracy of 95% , a precision of 100%, and an Fl score of 96. 45%. On the Instagram platform, which shares the same features as Facebook, our method can achieve a maximum Fl score of 97. 57%. One of the standout features of our approach is its efficiency, with the average video identification time across all fingerprint databases being less than 0. 4 seconds. This speed is vital for applications that require real-time decision-making, such as automated content moderation systems. In conclusion, this paper presents a pioneering method for the identification of encrypted videos transmitted via HTTP/3, filling the existing gap in encrypted video content recognition. The approach not only enhances the ability to monitor and regulate encrypted video content but also respects user privacy. This balance is critical in today's digital age, where privacy concerns are paramount. Our method can simultaneously address issues related to internet pollution regulation and citizen privacy protection without altering existing network architectures, thereby possessing significant practical value. © 2024 Science Press.

Prosumer trading necessitates sharing information to facilitate transactions. Additionally, many TEMs propose using blockchains to manage auctions and store transactions. These facts introduce privacy concerns: consumption data, trading history, and other identifying information pose risks to users if leaked. Anonymity by trading under a pseudonym is commonly presented as a solution; however, this creates risks for market participants: scammed users will not have recourse, and users with innocent malfunctions may be banned from trading. We propose the Individually Linkable Pseudonymous Trading Scheme (ILPTS), which enables users to trade under a pseudonym, protecting their identity, while a smart contract monitors reputations and can temporarily deanonymize a user, ensuring market integrity. ILPTS was developed in stages. Examination of existing TEM literature was performed to identify desirable features. Analysis of cryptography literature was performed to identify techniques that may confer certain features. It was found through formal analysis that ILPTS adheres to identified design goals, improves upon existing solutions, and resists common attacks against TEMs. Future work includes software simulation and on-device implementation to further verify security and feasibility. © 2024 by the authors."

In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm for encrypting color images. The algorithm is built upon the principles of differential equations, XOR operations, and chaotic maps. First, the plain image is three-dimensional pixel shuffled via a logistic map. Afterward, the differential equations are used as a mathematical tool for encrypting images. The third-order ordinary differential equations are used to encrypt the shuffled images. The color values of the plain image are considered coefficients for the independent variable X. Subsequently, an alternate matrix of the same size is generated using a three-dimensional logistic map, taking into account its color values as the exponents linked to the independent variable X. A set of third-order differential equations emerged, containing an equivalent number of elements as the color values present in the plain image. This set of differential equations is addressed in the following manner: combining XOR and integration three times with respect to the independent variable X for each set of obtained differential equations while treating the integration constant as zero. Ultimately, a set of ordinary equations involving the independent variable X is derived, where the coefficients of X represent color values for the cipher image. The results from experiments and the security analysis affirm the resilience of the proposed algorithm against established security attacks. It exhibits a substantial key space, heightened key sensitivity, and a strong encryption effect. © 2024 Author(s)."

Herein, this study utilizes in situ single crystal X-ray diffraction and synchrotron-based X-ray techniques to investigate the cooling-triggered irreversible single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation of the DMF solvated iodo-substituted squaraine dye (SQD-I). Transformation is observed to be mediated by solvent-involved XB formation and strengthening of electrostatic interaction between adjacent SQD-I molecules. By immersing a DMF solvate in acetonitrile a solvent exchange without loss of long-range ordering is observed. This is attributed to conservation of the molecular charge distribution of SQD-I molecules during the process. The different solvates can be used in combination for temperature-dependent image encryption. This work emphasizes the changes caused by XB formation to the electrostatic potentials of halogen containing molecules and their influence on material properties and presents the potential utility of XBs in the design of soft-porous crystals and luminescent materials. © 2024 The Authors.

Nonetheless, notable challenges still exist regarding achieving greater compression of carriers to enhance embedding capacity by adaptive-recognition coding of pixels in local areas based on the distribution characteristics of pixels in different cover images. To address the problem of the low embedding capacity of reversible information hiding due to insufficient utilization of redundant space in carrier images, herein, a cipher-text domain-reversible data-hiding algorithm is proposed based on difference coding and block compression. First, the difference-image matrix is classified and adaptively coded according to the maximum difference value within the block based on the differences of strong-correlation neighbors in local areas of the natural image. At the same time, the original image is chunked, disrupting the order between blocks and diffusing pixels within blocks to ensure the security of the image information. Then, according to the result of the adaptive coding of the difference-pixel blocks, the redundant space is compressed on the corresponding encrypted image blocks, and the secret data is finally embedded by bit replacement. In contrast to previous algorithms, this approach rearranges the bits of the differential-encoded image, starting from the least-significant bit of the cipher-text image pixel, marking the sign bit of the differential pixel, and marking the least-significant differential bit in each of the remaining planes in turn. Due to the reversibility of the encryption operation and adaptive coding, a legitimate receiver can achieve lossless reconstruction of the original plain-text image and error-free extraction of the secret data. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a greater embedding rate and better security than several existing algorithms. The average embedding rates were found to be 3.027 and 2.937 bpp for the BOSSbase and BOWS–2 datasets, respectively, and this was also improved by more than 0.57 bpp on classical test images. © 2024 Sichuan University.

This fabrication process has a scalability potential in conjunction with integrated circuit fabrication techniques and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. The fabricated cobalt ferrite memristor has shown a ratio between the on and off resistance of >1000 and has been implemented in a chaotic Chua's circuit, making it one of few physical implementations of a physical memristor in a physical circuit.

In this paper, we explore methods to “break” the quantum correlations. Specifically, we construct a dimension-independent k-partite disentangler (like) channel from bipartite unentangled input. In particular, we show: For every d, ℓ ≥ k ∈ N+, there is an efficient channel Λ: Cdℓ × Cdℓ → Cdk such that for every bipartite separable density operator ρ1 × ρ2, the output Λ(ρ1 × ρ2) is close to a k-partite separable state. Concretely, for some distribution µ on states from Cd, (k ℓ 3 )1/4! Λ(ρ1 × ρ2) − Z |ψ〉〈ψ|×kdµ(ψ) ≤ Õ 1 Moreover, Λ(|ψ〉〈ψ|×ℓ × |ψ〉〈ψ|×ℓ) = |ψ〉〈ψ|×k. Without the bipartite unentanglement assumption, the above bound is conjectured to be impossible and would imply QMA(2) = QMA. Leveraging multipartite unentanglement ensured by our disentanglers, we achieve the following: (i) a new proof that QMA(2) admits arbitrary gap amplification; (ii) a variant of the swap test and product test with improved soundness, addressing a major limitation of their original versions. More importantly, we demonstrate that unentangled quantum proofs of almost general real amplitudes capture NEXP, thereby greatly relaxing the non-negative amplitudes assumption in the recent work of QMA+(2) = NEXP [Jeronimo and Wu, STOC 2023]. Specifically, our findings show that to capture NEXP, it suffices to have unentangled proofs of the form |ψ〉 = √a|ψ+〉+ √1 − a|ψ−〉 where |ψ+〉 has non-negative amplitudes, |ψ−〉 only has negative amplitudes and |a − (1 − a)| ≥ 1/poly(n) with a ∈ [0, 1]. Additionally, we present a protocol achieving an almost largest possible completeness-soundness gap before obtaining QMAR(k) = NEXP, namely, a 1/poly(n) additive improvement to the gap results in this equality. © Fernando Granha Jeronimo and Pei Wu."

However, these algorithms still exhibit some problems, such as poor chaotic performance, flawed key design, and low efficiency. To solve these problems, we first constructed a robust hyperchaotic map called 2D-SQPM. Then, we further developed an efficient IE algorithm based on 2D-SQPM and a pixel fusion strategy (IEASP). The robustness and superiority of 2D-SQPM were verified through several chaotic indicators. These indicators include the Lyapunov exponent, sample entropy, Kolmogorov entropy, and permutation entropy, with average values of 11.5129, 2.8861, 2.4262, and 0.99989, respectively. Several targeted measures were devised in IEASP. Specifically, the common keystream avoids the need to constantly change secret keys. Pixel fusion reduces the computational cost of encryption operations. Two rounds of vector-level image filtering, chaotic pixel superposition, and intra-vector quick scrambling speed up encryption while strengthening security. The security and superiority of IEASP were confirmed through extensive experiments. IEASP achieved excellent scores for correlation coefficients (<0.005), information entropy (7.9998), NPCR (99.6096), and UACI (33.4643). Notably, IEASP also achieved an impressive average encryption rate of 56.3358 Mbps. Due to our targeted designs, IEASP outperforms many recently reported leading IE algorithms in several aspects, particularly in encryption efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, most existing deep learning models can only classify known encrypted traffic that has been sampled and labeled. In this paper, we propose CM-UTC, a cost-sensitive matrix-based method for classifying unknown encrypted traffic. CM-UTC explores the probability distribution of the DNN output layer to filter out the unknown classes and further designs a cost-sensitive matrix to address the class imbalance problem. Additionally, we propose the utilization of the Harris Hawk optimization algorithm to modify the model parameters and improve its performance. The experiments are validated on two different datasets, and the results demonstrate that CM-UTC not only outperforms existing methods in terms of overall performance but also exhibits superior capability in correctly identifying samples from the minority class.  © 2024 The British Computer Society.

Evidently, establishing practical means for collaboration and data sharing among institutions is a fundamental methodological barrier for performing high-powered studies. As the sample sizes become more heterogeneous, complex statistical approaches, such as generalized linear mixed effects models, must be used to correct for the confounders that may bias results. On another front, due to the privacy concerns around Protected Health Information (PHI), genetic information is restrictively protected by sharing according to regulations such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This limits data sharing among institutions and hampers efforts around executing high-powered collaborative studies. Federated approaches are promising to alleviate the issues around privacy and performance, since sensitive data never leaves the local sites. Motivated by these, we developed FedGMMAT, a federated genetic association testing tool that utilizes a federated statistical testing approach for efficient association tests that can correct for confounding fixed and additive polygenic random effects among different collaborating sites. Genetic data is never shared among collaborating sites, and the intermediate statistics are protected by encryption. Using simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate FedGMMAT can achieve the virtually same results as pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical resource requirements. © 2024 Li et al.

Despite extensive research on each noise process individually, a comprehensive understanding of their combined effect is still lacking. A crucial problem lies in determining the values of loss and dephasing for which the resulting loss-dephasing channel is antidegradable, implying the absence of codes capable of correcting its effect or, alternatively, capable of enabling quantum communication. A conjecture [Quantum 6, 821 (2022)2521-327X10.22331/q-2022-09-29-821] suggested that the bosonic loss-dephasing channel is not antidegradable if the loss is below 50%. In this paper we refute this conjecture, specifically proving that for any value of the loss, if the dephasing is above a critical value, then the bosonic loss-dephasing channel is antidegradable. While our result identifies a large parameter region where quantum communication is not possible, we also prove that if two-way classical communication is available, then quantum communication - and thus quantum key distribution - is always achievable, even for high values of loss and dephasing. © 2024 American Physical Society."

Here, we synthesized three zero-dimensional organic metal halides of (TPA)2SbCl5 (1), Sb3+-doped (TPA)SnCl5(H2O)·2H2O (Sb3+-2), and Sb3+-doped (TPA)2SnCl6 (Sb3+-3). Compared with the intense orange emission of 1, Sb3+-3 has smaller lattice distortion, thus effectively suppressing the exciton transformation from singlet to triplet self-trapped exciton (STE) states, which makes Sb3+-3 has stronger singlet STE emission and further bring a white emission with a photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 93.4%. Conversely, the non-emission can be observed in Sb3+-2 even though it has a similar [SbCl5]2- structure to 1, which should be due to its indirect bandgap characteristics and the effective non-radiative relaxation caused by H2O in the lattice. Interestingly, the non-emission of Sb3+-2 can convert into the bright emission of Sb3+-3 under TPACl DMF solution treatment. Meanwhile, the white emission under 315 nm excitation of Sb3+-3 can change into orange emission upon 365 nm irradiation, and the luminescence can be further quenched by the treatment of HCl. Therefore, a triple-mode reversible luminescence switch of off-onI-onII-off can be achieved. Finally, we demonstrated the applications of Sb3+-doped compounds in single-component white light illumination, latent fingerprint detection, fluorescent anti-counterfeiting, and information encryption. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

While this has brought convenience to users, it has also raised concerns about information security, including data security and identity authentication. IIoT devices are particularly vulnerable to attacks due to their lack of robust key management systems, efficient authentication processes, high fault tolerance, and other issues. To address these challenges, technologies such as blockchain and the formal analysis of security protocols can be utilized. And blockchain-based Industrial Internet of Things (BIIoT) is the new direction. These technologies leverage the strengths of cryptography and logical reasoning to provide secure data communication and ensure reliable identity authentication and verification, thereby becoming a crucial support for maintaining the security of the Industrial Internet. In this paper, based on the theory of the strand space attack model, we improved the Fiber Channel Password Authentication Protocol (FACP) security protocol in the network environment based on symmetric cryptography and asymmetric cryptography. Specifically, in view of the problem that the challenge value cannot reach a consensus under the symmetric cryptography system, and the subject identity cannot reach a consensus under the asymmetric cryptography system, an improved protocol is designed and implemented to meet the authentication requirements, and the corresponding attack examples are shown. Finally, the effectiveness and security of the protocol were verified by simulating different networking environments. The improved protocol has shown an increase in efficiency compared with the original protocol across three different network configurations. There was a 6.43% increase in efficiency when centralized devices were connected to centralized devices, a 5.81% increase in efficiency when centralized devices were connected to distributed devices, and a 6.32% increase in efficiency when distributed devices were connected to distributed devices. Experimental results show that this protocol can enhance the security and efficiency of communication between devices and between devices and nodes (servers, disks) in commonly used Ethernet passive optical network (EPON) environments without affecting the identity authentication function. © 2024 by the authors."

The photochromic fluorescence switching was achieved via modulation of the FRET mechanism between the open and closed isomeric forms of the dithienylethene unit. The photocyclization and cycloreversion processes displayed a good photoisomerization quantum yield (ΦO→C = 0.32 and ΦC→O = 0.089) in solution as well as in the solid state. Another switching channel was achieved by reversible modulation of the photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) process between ferrocene and cNDI units using Fe(ClO4)3 and NH2OH·HCl as chemical stimuli. The modulation of PET process by switching the oxidation state of iron in ferrocene and the photochromic isomerization via FRET, established a dual mode of the fluorescence switching phenomenon. The developed molecule was capable to withstand minimum 45 cycles of consecutive UV and visible light irradiation in solution and solid states, demonstrating its excellent fatigue resistance property. Thus, anticipating the efficient dual switching capability, Fc-DTE-cNDI was successfully applied in a secret code encryption-decryption technique and in the controlled singlet oxygen generation process. © 2024 American Chemical Society."

Security enhancement comes with a price – maintaining updatable keyword-wise state information. State information, if stored locally, incurs significant client-side storage overhead for keyword-rich datasets, potentially hindering real-world deployments. We propose DISCO, a simple and efficient framework for designing DSE schemes using constant client state. DISCO combines range-constrained pseudorandom functions (RCPRFs) over a global counter and leverages nice properties from the underlying primitives and index structure to simultaneously achieve forward-and-backward privacy and constant client state. To configure DISCO concretely, we identify a set of RCPRF properties that are vital for the resulting DISCO instantiations. By configuring DISCO with different RCPRFs, we resolve efficiency and usability issues in existing schemes. We further optimize DISCO’s concrete efficiency without downgrading security. We implement DISCO constructions and report performance, showing trade-offs from different DISCO constructions. Besides, we compare the practical efficiency of DISCO with existing non-constant-state DSE schemes, demonstrating DISCO’s competitive efficiency. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

In the stabilizer formalism of fault-tolerant quantum computation, the basic ingredients of the corresponding resource theory consist of stabilizer states as free states and stabilizer operations as free operations. The celebrated Gottesman-Knill theorem shows that quantum advantages over classical computation come from the magic (nonstabilizer) resource, such as magic states or non-Clifford gates. In this work, we prove that broadcasting of any magic state via stabilizer operations is impossible, which is reminiscent of the no-broadcasting theorems for noncommuting states or quantum correlations. We further derive a trade-off relation between the magic resource consumed in the initial system and that gained in the target system. These results characterize magic states in the stabilizer formalism from the broadcasting angle, and may have implications for distributed quantum computation and quantum secret sharing. © 2024 American Physical Society."

THz waves have attracted recent attention due to their extensive applications in detection, imaging, and communication. In terms of the properties of natural materials to THz waves, THz modulation devices have some limitations due to the natural material properties. THz metamaterials, which use periodic structures to modify the phase, amplitude, polarization, and propagation mode of THz waves, can overcome the limitations of natural materials. Compared to passive metamaterials with fixed optical properties, active metamaterials are more capable of reconfiguring and programmability. An active metamaterial can be achieved via combining metamaterial structural units with tunable functional materials. Vanadium dioxide (VO2), undergoing a metal-insulator phase transition, exhibits modulation depths exceeding 85% in electromagnetic wave transmittance from infrared to THz frequencies. Compared with other phase transition materials (i.e., GeTe), the phase transition temperature is closer to room temperature. VO2 has a promising application in active THz metamaterials due to its characteristics. This review represented the design principles and development of reconfigurable THz metamaterials based on VO2, emphasizing the structural design and performance of devices for tunable THz modulation. The structure and performance of VO2-based THz metamaterials were described. In the first part of this review, the application of VO2 in tunable THz metamaterial absorbers is represented. The phase transition of VO2 alters the equivalent resistance, capacitance and inductance of the periodic pattern via replacing the conventional surface metal patterns of absorbers with patterned VO2, resulting in tunable resonance absorption frequencies and absorption rates. Moreover, combining VO2 with different resonance patterns or other functional materials can further enhance the modulation depth and modulation frequency of THz absorbers. In the second part of this review, we discuss the application of VO2 in THz modulator devices based on the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect. The EIT effect in metamaterials is achieved via coupling ""bright modes"" and ""dark modes"" in an external field to generate a transparent window. Integrating VO2 into such terahertz metamaterials can improve the instability issue of traditional materials in exciting the EIT effect and further enhance the tunability of metamaterials. This approach also provides a feasible solution for information encryption. In addition, compared to conventional metamaterials for wavefront manipulation, the combination of VO2 and metamaterials allows a simultaneous manipulation of the amplitude and phase of THz waves, which significantly improves a holographic imaging quality and offers a design approach for THz imaging, optical encryption, optical communication, and other applications. Note that although the phase transition performance of vanadium dioxide can be adjusted theoretically, the thermal control method is susceptible to the influence of thermal diffusion from neighboring units, resulting in a thermal crosstalk. It is thus essential for future efforts increasing unit density and improving the quality of holographic imaging to integrate low thermal conductivity materials between unit structures. In the final part of this review, we introduce the use of VO2 in THz programmable metamaterials. Programmable metamaterials provide some design concepts and directions for metamaterials development. Combining VO2 with metamaterials and the hysteresis effect of first-order phase transition, VO2 demonstrates as a nonvolatile storage component in programmable metamaterials. In this approach, transition states are stored as ""memory"", allowing for intelligent THz electromagnetic information processing, and this memory functionality can be also used for adaptive control. Summary and prospects Despite the development of tunable THz metamaterials based on different principles, there are some challenges associated with the difficult etching of VO2 as well as the limited precision of the process. In addition, VO2 is not the most stable phase of vanadium oxide, which is greatly affected by oxygen during etching, affecting the performance of THz metamaterial devices. For future applications, power consumption and response time must be considered. It is therefore possible to achieve lower power consumption and faster thermal response time via doping vanadium dioxide or tuning the stain by the substrate to lower the phase transition temperature, although this may introduce some challenges such as a decrease in the magnitude of the conductivity change after the phase transition and a reduction in modulation depth. By contrast, it is possible to significantly improve the response time of devices by using pulsed intense laser excitation. Furthermore, machine learning and other methods can be integrated to achieve additional structural optimization. Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) controlled programmable metamaterials, which can switch different functions via changing input encoding sequences in real time, and greatly extend the application of metamaterials by dynamically manipulating electromagnetic waves. Metamaterials application and functionality will be enhanced by adding sensors to detect temperature, humidity, illumination, etc., facilitating the development of intelligent electromagnetic metamaterials with tunable properties in the future. © 2024 Chinese Ceramic Society.

Malware that calls security-sensitive services performs sensitive operations such as file read or write, access control, and system management, posing a direct and significant threat to system security. For instance, in the WannaCry ransomware incident that began in 2017 involved attackers spreading ransomware to victims ' devices through vulnerabilities. This ransomware encrypted and overwrote files by invoking the system's file writing services, aiming for ransom. In this paper, we define such attacks as unintended execution attacks, which are difficult to detect by existing techniques. The unintended execution attacks can lead to system crashes, data leakage, or destruction, -with serious implications for personal privacy, business operations, and national security. Analyzing the MITRE ATT&-CK attack matrix, we conclude that strategies closer to the end of the attack chain are more technically necessary. The invocation of security-sensitive services with high access and execution privileges at the end of the attack chain is a prerequisite for achieving attack objectives, making unintended execution attacks inevitable. Existing defense techniques primarily focus on mitigating and detecting the process of malicious code injection and exploitation, preventing attackers from executing malicious code injection, control flow hijacking, and privilege escalation through code injection or exploiting vulnerabilities in programs. However, with the emergence of new types of vulnerability exploitation techniques, such as code reuse attacks, and considering the performance overhead of mitigation techniques in commercial systems, practical defense solutions are vulnerable to being bypassed. In particular, when attackers enter the system in an unknown manner and run malicious software with privileged accounts, existing defense techniques fail to detect such unintended execution attacks in real time. Therefore, researching countermeasures against unintended execution attacks, serving as the last line of defense to block malicious activities by attackers, is of significant importance for ensuring the baseline security of critical information systems. By a deep understanding of the mechanisms and behavioral characteristics of unintended execution attacks, this paper designs and implements a lockdown protection mechanism, which complement existing defense techniques and act as a security bottom line, which is the last line of defense to intercept malware execution. This mechanism includes three key steps to detect and block unintended execution attacks: (1) expected behavior analysis, (2) actual behavior monitoring, and (3) blocking unexpected behaviors. Specifically, the lockdown protection structure analyzes the expected behaviors of a target program with respect to security-sensitive services at compile time, monitors the actual behaviors of the program at runtime, and verifies that the actual behavior of the program matches the expected behavior prior to service execution. If inconsistencies are detected, the invocation is identified as an unintended execution attack. This defense approach is rooted in the observation that the program's execution behavior during an unintended execution attack deviates from its expected behavior. Based on the observation of critical elements that could affect service behavior, we propose a lockdown-protection model as a theoretical model for defending against unintended execution attacks. We then implement a prototype of lockdown-protection structure on Einux platform. We utilize real-world APT malware, kernel privilege escalation exploits, and popular applications to evaluate the effectiveness of our prototype. We also evaluate the performance overhead of the prototype.

Herein, a series of self-assembled systems are reported using pillar[5]arene (DMP[5]) and spiropyran derivatives (SP-C4-Py). The assemblies rely on the time-encoded locking and unlocking ring-switching and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) units for information camouflage and multilevel encryption. DMP[5] with cyan solid fluorescence color acts as the host and energy transfer (EnT) donor, while photochromic SP-C4-Py with the ring-opened and closed isomers acts as guest and EnT acceptor. When irradiated, the assemblies undergo a time-dependent luminescence color change ranging from cyan to yellow to red through a FRET process. The molar ratio of host and guest in the assembly systems affects the FRET efficiency, and the power of the irradiation source influences the isomerization degree and rate of SP-C4-Py, allowing for precise control over the fluorescent color transition time. The combination of molecular composition and external stimuli governs the kinetics of color change, resulting in a difference in the appearance time of a specific fluorescent color pre-designed as correct authorized information. By combining these diverse assembles in one label, information encryption and dynamic information identification are achieved in the dimensions of time, ratio, and light power. This time-dependent feature offers the assembly materials with a multilevel security and provides new possibilities for anti-counterfeiting and blocking information leakage. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

Nevertheless, the RTP color of most organic materials has been limited to blue, green, and yellow. In this study, a series of red RTP materials have been successfully fabricated at a large scale through a straightforward molecular doping strategy. Remarkably, the doped materials exhibited red RTP at 622 nm and 678 nm with an ultralong lifetime of 373 ms and an efficiency of 5.21 %, which was among the best performances reported for organic RTP materials. The systematic investigation unveiled that the efficient RTP emanated from the robust interactions between the emitter and matrix molecules as well as the formation of D/A exciplexes. Furthermore, the red RTP materials could be easily manufactured into diverse forms, including fine powders, aqueous inks, and nanoparticles. Their multifunctional applications in fingerprint recognition, encryption, and live bioimaging were demonstrated.

However, they have recently shown poor durability and photostability. In this context, an anti-counterfeiting photochromic nanofibrous membrane was developed for data encoding. Rare-earth doped aluminate nanoparticles (RAN) were embedded in a nanofibrous labeling system composed of a cellulose nanocrystal-reinforced polysulfone nanocomposite (PSU). Cellulose nanocrystals were prepared from microcrystalline cellulose, displaying diameters of 10–20 nm. RAN exhibited diameters of 5–14 nm, and PSU fibers displayed diameters of 75–150 nm. Impressive photostability, durability, and reversibility were achieved by the RAN-immobilized nanofibrous label. The emission properties of the photoresponsive nanofibrous membrane were tailored by manipulating the amount of RAN. The nanofibrous membrane was colorless under visible lighting conditions, whereas a green emission was detected when exposed to ultraviolet radiation. An emission peak of 519 nm indicated a green color, whereas an excitation peak of 365 nm suggested transparency. In order to identify the chemical composition and structural properties of the produced nanofibrous membranes, different microscopic and spectroscopic techniques were used. The mechanical performance of the paper sheets coated with RAN@PSU nanofibers was investigated. The current strategy provides a simple procedure for the development of nanofibrous membranes, which can assist to combat forging of commercial products. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

We revisit this problem and conduct a refined analysis to address an ambiguous condition that was previously introduced in the context of RSA-polynomial based semiprime factorization. By deriving an accurate attack condition, we are able to identify weak cases of the RSA-polynomial problem and expand the vulnerable bound. To facilitate this, we propose two optimized factoring attacks that leverage improved lattice-based theorems for solving bivariate integer polynomials of a specific form. The validity and effectiveness of our proposed factoring attacks are verified through both theoretical analysis and experimental results. Additionally, we examine the RSA-polynomial based commitment scheme and identify deficiencies that compromise its reliability.

When randomness plays an important role, like in cryptography where random bit sequences guarantee certain levels of security, quantum mechanical phenomena allow new ways of generating random bit sequences. Such sequences have a lot of applications in the communication sector, e.g., regarding data transmission, simulation, sensors or radars, and beyond. They can be generated deterministically (e.g., by using polynomials, resulting in pseudo-random sequences) or in a non-deterministic way (e.g., by using physical noise sources like external devices or sensors, resulting in random sequences). Important characteristics of such binary sequences can be modelled by gap processes in conjunction with the probability theory. Recently, all-optical approaches have attracted a lot of research interest. In this work, an adaptation of the quantum key distribution setup is utilized for generating randomised bit sequences. The simulation results show that all-optically generated sequences very well resemble the theoretically ideal probability density characteristic. Additionally, an experimental optical setup is developed that confirms the simulation results. Furthermore, m-sequences show very promising results as well as Gold sequences. Additionally, the level of burstiness, i.e., the distribution of ones and zeros throughout the sequence, is studied for the different sequences. The results enable the finding that generator polynomials with concentrated non-zero coefficients lead to more bursty bit sequences. © 2024 by the authors."

During drone-related criminal investigations, the implicated drones are often forcibly brought down, which poses significant challenges in conducting forensic analysis. In order to restore the truth of criminal cases, it is necessary to extract data not only from the external TF card but also from internal chip memory in drone forensics. To address this issue, a drone data parser (DRDP) is proposed to extract internal and external data from criminal-implicated drones. In this paper, we present comprehensive forensics on the DJI Mavic 2 Pro, analyzing the main file structure and encryption model. According to its file structures, three case studies are conducted on various file types (DAT files, TXT files, and default files) to verify the effectiveness and applicability of the designed procedure. The results show that the encrypted data of the implicated drone, such as GPS information, flight time, flight altitude, flight distance, three velocity components (x, y, z) and other information can be extracted and decrypted correctly, which provides evidence for the identification of the case facts. © 2024 by the authors."

Due to the widespread popularity of RSA, there have been many proposed attacks on the factorization problem such as side-channel attacks where some bits of the prime factors are available. When enough bits of the prime factors are known, two methods that are effective at solving the factorization problem are satisfiability (SAT) solvers and Coppersmith's method. The SAT approach reduces the factorization problem to a Boolean satisfiability problem, while Coppersmith's approach uses lattice basis reduction. Both methods have their advantages, but they also have their limitations: Coppersmith's method does not apply when the known bit positions are randomized, while SAT-based methods can take advantage of known bits in arbitrary locations, but have no knowledge of the algebraic structure exploited by Coppersmith's method. In this paper we describe a new hybrid SAT and computer algebra approach to efficiently solve random leaked-bit factorization problems. Specifically, Coppersmith's method is invoked by a SAT solver to determine whether a partial bit assignment can be extended to a complete assignment. Our hybrid implementation solves random leaked-bit factorization problems significantly faster than either a pure SAT or pure computer algebra approach.  © 2024 ACM."

To address this issue, this paper proposes a power prediction method for regional distributed PV power stations based on meteorological encryption and spatio-temporal graph networks. First, inverse distance weighted meteorological encryption technology is used to achieve the comprehensive coverage of key meteorological resources based on the geographical locations of PV power stations and the meteorological resources of weather stations. Next, the historical power correlations between PV power stations are analyzed, and highly correlated stations are connected to construct a topological graph structure. Then, an improved spatio-temporal graph network model is established based on this graph to deeply mine the spatio-temporal characteristics of regional PV power stations. Furthermore, a dual-layer attention mechanism is added to further learn the feature attributes of nodes and enhance the spatio-temporal features extracted by the spatio-temporal graph network, ultimately achieving power prediction for regional PV power stations.

This increases the particle size and overall crystallinity along with the modifications of the surface functional groups, which eventually show a new emission band at longer wavelengths. Detailed photophysical and temperature-dependent luminescence studies confirmed that the new emissive state evolves due to interparticle interactions in the excited state. Furthermore, the occurrence of a new emissive state in a longer-wavelength region helped reduce the energy gap between the lowest excited singlet state and the lowest excited triplet state in modified sulfur dots, resulting in an aqueous stable room-temperature phosphorescence/afterglow emission through efficient intersystem crossing.

Herein, we show that a straightforward and effective combination of wet spinning and twisting technique enables continuously fabricating RTP fibers with twisting-induced helical chirality. By leveraging the hydrogen bonding interactions between polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and quinoline derivatives, along with the rigid microenvironment provided by PVA chains, typically, Q-NH2@PVA fiber demonstrates outstanding phosphorescent characteristics with RTP lifetime of 1.08 s and phosphorescence quantum yield of 24.6 %, and the improved tensile strength being 1.7 times than pure PVA fiber (172±5.82 vs 100±5.65 MPa). Impressively, the transformation from RTP to circularly polarized room temperature phosphorescence (CP-RTP) is readily achieved by imparting left- or right-hand helical structure through simply twisting, enabling large-scale production of chiral Q-NH2@PVA fiber with dissymmetry factor of 10−2.

Here, Cs2InCl5·H2O/Sb and Cs2NaInCl6/Sb with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 99.61 and 99.9%, respectively, were achieved. Considering the excellent optical performances together with the high similarity of the two crystal structures, we tried to realize the crystal structure transition from Cs2InCl5·H2O/Sb to Cs2NaInCl6/Sb by an ion-exchange method. It was well done by just adding the NaCl precursor with different concentrations in the Cs2InCl5·H2O/Sb product. Interestingly, a gradual color change from yellow to orange, warm white, white, cool white, and blue was achieved in the process of crystal structure transition. The energy-transfer dynamic models of Cs2InCl5·H2O/Sb, the white product, and Cs2NaInCl6/Sb were identified. The chemical reaction and UV fluorescence properties made it possible for application in chemical and fluorescent double-modal anticounterfeiting and highly decreased the possibility of being cracked and copied. Especially, when salt for daily cooking was used to replace NaCl, a similar phenomenon happened as that of the 99.9% NaCl precursor, which made it easy to be applicated. The combination of chemical and optical verifications provides two levels of security and unbreakable encryption. The results demonstrate that the transition from Cs2InCl5·H2O/Sb to Cs2NaInCl6/Sb is highly promising in fluorescent anticounterfeiting application. © 2024 American Chemical Society."

Data anonymization is a type of data processing for obscuring or removing personal data from any dataset, in order to protect the privacy of individuals. This process includes artificial intelligence (AI), information and web technologies, cryptography, and statistics. The chapter presents a domain ontology of data anonymization. Generally, a domain ontology contains the concepts (as units of knowledge, accomplished by their properties and relations) in a given domain of interest. Ontology, as a theory and technology of knowledge modeling, provides a means for systematizing, classifying, interpreting, and standardizing concepts and terminology within a specific domain. This, in turn, enhances the shared understanding and application of knowledge within that domain. Ontological modeling provides a conceptual foundation and serves as a tool for formal, machine-understandable knowledge representation and generation. It supports research across various knowledge domains. In the particular case, the literature review shows a lack of complete ontology-based knowledge modeling of the data anonymization. The application of this ontology is considered to be a foundation supporting AI-based expert systems in the domain. It is also a reusable source of knowledge for the theory and practice of data privacy tools and policies. The proposed ontology is developed by methodology including: goals and knowledge range defining; text corpus composition including contemporary documents of the data anonymization; extracting main concepts from a respective text corpus; compilation of a controlled vocabulary and a thesaurus containing extracted concepts and their associative and hierarchical relations using specified local database; ontology formalization considering related external ontologies; ontology code reasoning, verification, and querying; publication and distribution of the ontology code. The data anonymization ontology code and its brief description in Ontohub repository are stored and freely available. The results and possible applications of the ontology are discussed. In conclusion, the benefits of future support, extension, and improvement of the proposed data anonymization ontology are underlined. © 2024 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

For ensuring the security of information, quantum information splitting (QIS) method is used in which quantum communication is made more secure by splitting the quantum information among the various quantum nodes within a quantum network in such a way that any one node can retrieve the quantum information completely with the collaboration of remaining quantum nodes. In this paper, by using Bell states as the quantum channel we present a simple and precise scheme for quantum information splitting of an arbitrary single-qubit quantum information state among N (N ≥ 2) recipient nodes which are separately entangled with the sender node only and not with one another. We also generalize our scheme to the splitting of multi-qubit quantum information state among the N recipient nodes by using 2-qubit Bell states as the quantum resource. In comparison to the previous existing QIS schemes which require multi-qubit entangled states as the quantum resource, our proposed QIS scheme is very simple and feasible. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd."

Subliminal channel attacks are one of the kleptographic attacks. In such attacks, backdoors are embedded in implementations of randomized algorithms to elaborately control randomness generation, such that the secrets will be leaked from biased outputs. To thwart subliminal channel attacks, double-splitting is a feasible solution, which splits the randomness generator of a randomized algorithm into two independent generators. In this paper, we instantiate double-splitting to propose a secure randomness generation algorithm dubbed SRG using two physically independent generators: ordinary and public randomness generators. Based on public blockchains, we construct the public randomness generator, which can be verified publicly. Hashes of a sufficient number of consecutive blocks that are newly confirmed on a blockchain are used to produce public randomness. In SRG, outputs from the two generators are taken as inputs of an immunization function. SRG accomplishes immunization against subliminal channel attacks. Additionally, we discuss the application strategies of SRG for symmetric and public-key encryption. © Science China Press 2024."

Here, three emitting metal-organic halides with formula [ZnX2(bidpe)] (X = Cl for 1, X = Br for 2, X = I for 3, bidpe = 4,4′-bis(imidazol-1-yl)diphenyl ether) were prepared and their photophysical properties were investigated. The complexes exhibit dual emission of fluorescence and phosphorescence via anti-Kasha’s rule, and their RTP properties of resultant products are modulated by halide substitution synthesis. DFT calculations indicate that the singlet states exhibit a halide-ligand charge transfer (XLCT) character while the triplet states are dominated by the intraligand π-π* transitions.

Such extractors have wide applications in cryptography and have become important cornerstones in recent breakthroughs of explicit constructions of two-source extractors and affine extractors for small entropy. However, explicit constructions of nonmalleable extractors appear to be much harder than standard extractors. Indeed, in the well-studied models of two-source and affine non-malleable extractors, the previous best constructions only work for entropy rate > 2/3 and 1 − γ for some small constant γ > 0 respectively by Li (FOCS’ 23). In this paper, we present explicit constructions of two-source and affine non-malleable extractors that match the state-of-the-art constructions of standard ones for small entropy. Our main results include: Two-source and affine non-malleable extractors (over F2) for sources on n bits with min-entropy k ≥ logC n and polynomially small error, matching the parameters of standard extractors by Chattopadhyay and Zuckerman (STOC’ 16, Annals of Mathematics’ 19) and Li (FOCS’ 16). Two-source and affine non-malleable extractors (over F2) for sources on n bits with min-entropy k = O(log n) and constant error, matching the parameters of standard extractors by Li (FOCS’ 23). Our constructions significantly improve previous results, and the parameters (entropy requirement and error) are the best possible without first improving the constructions of standard extractors. In addition, our improved affine non-malleable extractors give strong lower bounds for a certain kind of read-once linear branching programs, recently introduced by Gryaznov, Pudlák, and Talebanfard (CCC’ 22) as a generalization of several well studied computational models. These bounds match the previously best-known average-case hardness results given by Chattopadhyay and Liao (CCC’ 23) and Li (FOCS’ 23), where the branching program size lower bounds are close to optimal, but the explicit functions we use here are different. Our results also suggest a possible deeper connection between non-malleable extractors and standard ones. © Xin Li and Yan Zhong."

Key mismatch attacks are a major type of misuse attack. In key mismatch attacks, the adversary aims to recover the reused secret key by sending special ciphertexts to the target party and observing whether the shared key matches his guesses or not. In this paper, we propose pairwise-parallel key mismatch attacks. The strategy is to recover partial information about multiple coefficient-pairs of the secret key in a parallel way per query. We realize the multi-value key mismatch oracle in a key exchange scenario and experimentally validate our proposed attacks. Our attacks greatly reduce the number of queries required to recover the full secret key. Specifically, compared with state-of-the-art key mismatch attacks on CPA-secure Kyber, our attacks reduce the number of queries by 95% with computational complexity of 232. Then we employ the post-processing with lattice reduction to further minimize the number of queries. The results show we only need 78 queries to recover the full secret key of Kyber1024 with a lattice reduction cost of 232. Moreover, our proposed pairwise-parallel attack method can be applied to improve the PC oracle-based SCA against CCA-secure Kyber, reducing the number of queries/traces by 16.67%. Futhermore, the proposed attacks can be applied to Saber and other lattice-based KEMs. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

Unfortunately, most major cryptocurrencies today, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, employ signature schemes that are susceptible to quantum adversaries, i.e., an adversary with access to a quantum computer can forge signatures and thereby spend coins of honest users. In cryptocurrency networks, signature schemes are typically not executed in isolation, but within a so-called cryptographic wallet. In order to achieve security against quantum adversaries, the signature scheme and the cryptographic wallet must withstand quantum attacks. In this work, we advance the study on post-quantum secure signature and wallet schemes. That is, we provide the first formal model for deterministic threshold wallets and we show a generic post-quantum secure construction from any post-quantum secure threshold signature scheme with rerandomizable keys.

Signers are required to interact but some may fail or misbehave at any point in the signing protocol. Then, we provide efficient constructions of such schemes based on lattice assumptions. We show their security in the programmable random oracle model. For N participants they tolerate up to N − 1 Byzantine failures assuming a correct aggregator, and ⌊N+1/3⌋ failures in general. Our final construction is more efficient than Squirrel, the state-of-the-art non-interactive scheme, which in contrast to ours is also just a few-time signature scheme. Asymptotically signature sizes are polylogarithmic in the total number of participants. In the failure-free case our scheme becomes essentially equivalent to - and thus just as efficient as - a state-of-the-art interactive aggregate signature schemes from lattice assumptions. At the same time we make weaker assumptions on the signing protocol. Finally, we parameterize, implement, and evaluate our signature scheme. We find that it has aggregate signatures of sizes (i) between 41 KiB (best case) and 151 KiB (worst case) for 1000 signers, (ii) between 59 KiB (best case) and 399 KiB (worst case) for 10,000 signers, and (iii) between 75 KiB (best case) and 750 KiB (worst case) for 100,000 signers. Verification times for our Rust implementation are in practice faster than those of a state-of-the-art implementation of aggregate BLS signatures, at the cost of slower signature aggregation, both by about one order of magnitude. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

Code-based digital signatures are in high demand as quantum computers are extremely effective at breaking widely used digital signatures. The Courtois–Finiasz–Sendrier (CFS) scheme is one of the most popular code-based digital signature schemes. However, it has some disadvantages, such as a large public key size and poor signing efficiency. To address this issue, we construct a digital signature scheme named ENR DigiSig (Ekta Narwal and Rupali Digital Signature) using polar codes with several characteristics such as small signature size, low signing time, and high signing efficiency. Here, the hash of a shorter length is used in a specific way; then, padding is done to the hash output so that the result can be decoded. For this study, we have selected a fixed polar code rate of 0.5 and a blocklength of N=2n;n⩽4. According to the experimental results, more than 96% of the signatures are generated successfully. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Research on stimulus-responsive metal halide perovskites offers promising solutions. However, common hydrothermal or hot injection synthesis methods are time-consuming and require harsh conditions. Here, a facile two-step inorganic-salt-solution-assisted grinding strategy is proposed. Through this method, cations and rare earth ion doping and halogen-site substitution all can be achieved without the use of strong acids, organic solvents, and high temperatures. Significantly, by this two-step postsynthesizing, the structural dimensional transformation of perovskites can also be realized. Especially, the reversible conversion between blue-emission Cs2KInCl6:Sb3+ and yellow-emission Cs2InCl5·H2O:Sb3+ is explored by inserting and removing KCl, and the driven mechanism of this reversible phase transition is determined by formation enthalpy and formation energy variation. Finally, on the basis of the reversible phase transition and combining I Ching’s 64 hexagrams with the consonants and vowels of Chinese characters in pinyin, a culturally rich, more secure, and innovative encryption and decryption mode is created.

In this model, the image encryption method is studied using block diagonal chaotic (BDC) matrix and quantum based private key. The block diagonal chaotic model is designed with structured matrix based on two different nonlinear chaotic sequences and private key bits combined with quantum walks (QWs) path. At sender, the key bits convert to QWs states to increase tamper resistant of quantum key distribution in noisy communication channel. At the receiver side, the received data is retrieved merely by both initial key bits and states as similar as the sender initial key bits and states. If the eavesdropper attempts to measure quantum based private key, the key bits change to different states compared to real sender states and drops the bits eavesdropped in quantum channel. We call the hybrid chaotic image encryption method with private key based on quantum states as chaotic quantum key distribution (CQKD) method. The key space is evaluated using CQKD model rather than chaotic based encryption method without quantum distributed states over impure channels. Considering the sensitivity of block diagonal chaotic-based encryption BDC method with accuracy of 10(−32), the key space is increased from 10111 to 10142×10a×f(ΔΦ)×(1Δpe)Ne with phase-shifted QWs. It guarantees no information access by attackers considering high security against brute-force attacks and outperforms rather than the conventional chaotic encryption schemes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Recently, Firefox has started to support IndexedDB storage in private mode by storing encrypted files on disk during private sessions since July 2023. Since then, Gecko-based browsers' effort to support client-side storages through encrypted files on disk has been continued with Tor Browser also began supporting IndexedDB in the same way since October 2023.

So far, linear homomorphic signatures based on Public Key Instruction,identity, as well as certificateless, have been proposed in wireless sensor networks to resist the data contamination. However, these signature schemes cannot perform finer-grained signature verification, and these signature schemes do not realize the separation of users’ sensitive information from their data. To solve the above problems, we design an attribute-based linear homomorphic signature scheme for large-scale wireless network built with mobile smart devices.

In this paper, we propose a novel verifiable quantum secret sharing protocol using the d-dimensional product state and Lagrange interpolation techniques. This protocol is initiated by the dealer Alice, who initially prepares a quantum product state, selected from a predefined set of orthogonal product states within the ℂd ⊗ ℂd framework. Subsequently, the participants execute unitary operations on this product state to recover the underlying secret. Furthermore, we subject the protocol to a rigorous security analysis, considering both eavesdropping attacks and potential dishonesty from the participants. Finally, we conduct a comparative analysis of our protocol against existing schemes. Our scheme exhibits economies of scale by exclusively employing quantum product states, thereby realizing significant cost-efficiency advantages. In terms of access structure, we adopt a (t,n)-threshold architecture, a strategic choice that augments the protocol’s practicality and suitability for diverse applications. Furthermore, our protocol includes a rigorous integrity verification mechanism to ensure the honesty and reliability of the participants throughout the execution of the protocol. © 2024 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd."

However, the lack of effective trap control in storage phosphors has resulted in limited storage capacity. In this study, we have prepared a series of NaLu(Gd)GeO4:Bi3+,Ln3+ (Ln = Eu, Tb, Dy, Pr, Sm, Er, Nd, Ho, Tm, and Yb) materials exhibiting tunable multimode and multicolor stimuli-responsive luminescence. The enhanced thermo-stimulated luminescence of five times is obtained in NaLuGeO4:Bi3+,Eu3+ relative to NaLuGeO4:Bi3+, where Bi3+ not only serves as the luminescent center but also as the hole trap center, and trace amounts of Eu3+ act as electron traps to form stable electron-hole pair traps together with Bi3+ hole traps. We propose a new method to improve trap density by constructing electron-hole pair traps via utilizing Bi3+ and Ln3+ as both trap makers and luminescence centers. Density functional theory calculations provide detailed information on the band structures of the matrix and electronic properties, which has confirmed the types of traps and then supports persistent luminescence mechanisms. Particularly, our phosphors are used as optical storage medium for multilevel optical data recording in a single physical layer through managing traps via setting the temperature.

Thus, developing an ecofriendly storage carrier that allows for reversible information recording is one of the current research priorities. However, the thermal reversible information storage carriers reported so far have difficulty forming a stable structure, which limits their large-scale application. In this study, a novel color developer, 1-(4-hydroxyphenethyl)-3-octadecylurea (PCU), was synthesized using p-hydroxyphenylethylamine and octadecyl isocyanate. By combining it with fluoran dyes (FDs) and introducing natural cellulose as a binder resin, we successfully prepared a thermoreversible color-changing cellulose film with excellent color development performance. This film has a tensile strength of over 40 MPa and an elongation of over 10% and exhibited stable and efficient rewritable performance in 50 cycles of color development tests. Furthermore, it maintains a high color density for up to 20 weeks, and environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and sunlight exposure have minimal effect on its color display and retention capabilities. Building upon this, application scenarios, such as ink-free stamping, thermal printing, and information encryption, have been further designed. The results show that the film’s ink-free stamping is simple and effective, thermal printing patterns are clear, and information encryption is convenient and straightforward, demonstrating broad application prospects and providing a new approach to the fabrication of novel reversible information storage carriers. © 2024 American Chemical Society"

To protect sensitive information, these graphs are usually encrypted before being outsourced to the cloud. A significant challenge is how to answer SPD retrieval in a secure, efficient, and accurate manner. However, recent works have yet to concurrently tackle all three aspects to meet this challenge. To address this challenge, we design, implement, and evaluate CryptGraph, the first scheme simultaneously allowing private, efficient, and accurate retrieval over encrypted graphs. CryptGraph leverages additive homomorphic encryptions to protect graphs and client information. A series of secure protocols are tailored based on the two-cloud (i.e., server) model. Supported by these protocols, CryptGraph converts SPD retrieval from the ciphertext domain to both the plaintext (for vertices) and secret-sharing (for weights) domains, achieving access pattern protection and remarkable efficiency close to plain retrieval. The security of CryptGraph is formally analyzed under the semi-honest adversary model. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world graph datasets, demonstrating millisecond-level efficiency and 100% accuracy rates. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

High channel loss may decrease the signal-to-noise ratio due to background noise, reduce the number of generated raw key bits, and increase the quantum bit error rate (QBER), all of which have detrimental effects on the output secret key length. Under finite-size security analysis, a higher QBER increases the minimum raw key length necessary for nonzero secret-key-length extraction due to less efficient reconciliation and postprocessing overheads. We show that recent developments in finite-key analysis allow three different small-satellite-based QKD projects, CQT-Sat, the United Kingdom QUARC-ROKS, and QEYSSat, to produce secret keys even under conditions of very high loss, improving on estimates based on previous finite-key bounds. This suggests that satellites in low Earth orbit can satisfy finite-size security requirements but that this remains challenging for satellites further from Earth. We analyze the performance of each mission to provide an informed route toward improving the performance of small-satellite QKD missions. We highlight the short- and long-term perspectives on the challenges and potential future developments in small-satellite-based QKD and quantum networks. In particular, we discuss some of the experimental and theoretical bottlenecks and the improvements necessary to achieve QKD and wider quantum networking capabilities in daylight and at different altitudes.  © 2024 authors.

The selecting channel and position scrambling and cross-channel S-shaped diffusion methods proposed in this study push the encryption to a new depth. Compared with ordinary methods, it is more thorough in disrupting pixel positions, increases the complexity of pixel relationships between different channels, and substantially improves the unpredictability of encryption. To support this approach, we design a four-dimensional conservative hyperchaotic system with a very large hyperchaotic interval, which combines the high randomness of the conservative system and the broad key-space property of the hyperchaotic system, effectively defending against the risk of phase-space reconstruction aroused by missing attractors and reducing the possibility of being cracked. We deeply analyze the dynamic properties of the system by means of phase diagrams, bifurcation diagrams and Lyapunov exponents. The cross-channel scrambling and diffusion encryption algorithm designed based on this system not only ensures the security of image information during transmission, but also greatly enhances the ability to resist various attacks. The proposal of this method undoubtedly brings a secure solution to the field of image encryption. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd"

This is achieved following a wavelength-division multiplexing approach, where the classical synchronization signal and the quantum states are propagated in the same optical fiber. The employed frame synchronization method is based on the monitoring of the quantum bit error ratio (QBER) of the quantum channel, thus avoiding additional hardware and high computational resources. We evaluate the operation of SOP generation method through the assessment of the individual response of the waveplates that comprise the employed electronic polarization controller. Finally, the performance was assessed by computing the overall QBER and the QBER contributions of each of the four polarization states associated with the different qubits. The measurements, obtained during six hours, show a slight variation of the QBER values associated with the individual contributions, reaching an overall QBER of 0.75%. This demonstrates the capability of the presented methods to operate, stably, with very low QBER values, making its application in practical QKD systems reliable. © 2024 The Author(s).

We collect data from the National Vulnerability Database, individual project repositories and mailing lists, and other relevant sources for all widely used cryptographic libraries. In our investigation of the causes of these vulnerabilities, we find evidence of a correlation between the complexity of these libraries and their (in)security, empirically demonstrating the potential risks of bloated cryptographic codebases. Among our most interesting findings is that 48.4% of vulnerabilities in libraries written in C and C++ are either primarily caused or exacerbated by memory safety issues, indicating that systems-level bugs are a major contributor to security issues in these systems. Cryptographic design and implementation issues make up 27.5% of vulnerabilities across all libraries, with side-channel attacks providing a further 19.4%. We find substantial variation among core library components in both complexity levels and vulnerabilities produced: for instance, over one-third of vulnerabilities are located in implementations of the SSL/TLS protocols, providing actionable evidence for codebase quality and security improvements in these libraries. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

Recently, an increasing number of Decentralized Applications (DApps) are appearing on various blockchain platforms. DApps employ encryption techniques such as SSL/TLS to safeguard the data transmitted over the network, making it more challenging to do traffic classification. In this paper, to tackle the challenge of insufficient classification accuracy in the existing classification of encrypted DApp traffic, we present CapsuleFormer, a novel encrypted traffic classification model for DApps. CapsuleFormer utilizes capsule neurons instead of traditional scalar neurons, where the neurons within the capsule embody various attributes of particular entities. Furthermore, Transformer blocks are adopted to generate a high-dimensional representation of the capsule activation vector. Thus, CapsuleFormer has the capability to extract potential features from the encrypted traffic patterns of DApps. Moreover, we collect and open a dataset of more than 700,000 encrypted traffic flows from 10 different types of DApps.

In addition, security analysis shows that these two protocols can resist various attacks from inside and outside, such as participant attacks and entangle-measure attacks. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd."

Image encryption technology plays a crucial role in the field of information security and has garnered significant attention because it can effectively safeguard the privacy and integrity of image data. This study innovatively designed a color image encryption algorithm by combining the Sine chaotic mapping with the trigonometric function Cosine. It utilized the dichotomy idea for segmentation and introduced an improved Sine chaotic mapping (ISCM). By adjusting the parameter combination of ISCM, the complexity of the key space is effectively enhanced. The random chaotic sequence generated by the ISCM is used to control the DNA encoding and decoding process. At the same time, through star scrambling technology, the limitations of the single number of traditional DNA rules are overcome. Color images are confused and scrambled in multiple dimensions, enhancing the security and reliability of the encryption process. This provides a high level of protection for the transmission of image data, reducing the risks of data leakage and tampering. In the analysis of experimental data, the average value of the UACI test data perfectly matches the ideal value of 33.4635%, and the average value of the information entropy analysis data is 7.999 or above. This further verifies the superiority and reliability of this study. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd."

However, the anticounterfeiting encryption of these materials can only be achieved in the dark, and there are a few reports of achieving anticounterfeiting encryption effects in both sunlight and darkness. Herein, a flexible strategy for the preparation of highly crystalline, multicolor tunable p-RTP films is provided by mixing water-soluble aromatic sodium salts with a cellulose nanocrystal (CNC)-dispersed aqueous solution and casting the resulting mixture into a film. Specifically, the formation of rigid clusters through hydrogen bonds and ion interactions between sodium aromatic acids and cellulose segments leads to the generation of multiple emission centers, enabling tunable p-RTP emissions ranging from blue to red. This phenomenon can be reasonably explained by a cluster-triggered emission (CTE) mechanism. Moreover, these luminescent materials exhibit excitation (λex-) and temperature (T)-dependent multicolor tunable phosphorescence concurrently. Notably, observing T-dependent full-color gamut persistent phosphorescence under identical excitation conditions has rarely been reported before, which also further supports the CTE mechanism. Variable temperature experiments and theoretical calculations fully demonstrate that responsive emission originates from multiple emission centers formed within the doped film structure. These p-RTP-doped films based on structural color characteristics of CNC have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in information encryption and anticounterfeiting under both sunlight and darkness. This approach combines conventional conjugated units with macromolecular cluster luminescence techniques, providing a sustainable and flexible method for fabricating tunable p-RTP materials while also serving as a reference for intelligent luminescent materials. © 2024 American Chemical Society"

The SHIELD protocol, combined with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in counter mode, named CTR-SHIELD, targets try-and-check attacks. However, CTR-SHIELD is vulnerable to desynchronization attacks on its counter blocks. To counteract this, we introduce the DTR-SHIELD protocol, where DTR stands for double counters. DTR-SHIELD addresses the desynchronization issue by altering the counter incrementation process, which previously solely relied on truncated serial IDs.

NFV provides networking services like routing, security, storage, etc., through software-based virtual machines. As a result, NFV reduces equipment costs. Due to the increase in applications on Industrial Internet of Things (IoT)-based networks, security threats have also increased. The communication links between people and people or from one machine to another machine are insecure. Usually, critical data are exchanged over the IoE, so authentication and confidentiality are significant concerns. Asymmetric key cryptosystems increase computation and communication overheads. This paper proposes a lightweight and certificateless end-to-end secure communication scheme to provide security services against replay attacks, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, and impersonation attacks with low computation and communication overheads. The system is implemented on Linux-based Lubuntu 20.04 virtual machines using Java programming connected to NFV-based large-scale hybrid IPv4-IPv6 virtual networks. Finally, we compare the performance of our proposed security scheme with existing schemes based on the computation and communication costs. In addition, we measure and analyze the performance of our proposed secure communication scheme over NFV-based virtualized networks with regard to several parameters like end-to-end delay and packet loss. The results of our comparison with existing security schemes show that our proposed security scheme reduces the computation cost by 38.87% and the communication cost by 26.08%. © 2024 by the authors."

In the considered bilateral control system, the leader and follower receive the follower's force information and the leader's velocity information, respectively, through the wave variables. The considered attack model multiplies the wave variables by an attack parameter, which is possible due to the malleability of the encryption scheme. The bilateral control system will be destabilized if the attacker chooses a relatively large parameter value. This motivates in developing a passivity observer for each leader and follower side to compute the total energy and constructing an energy-based detection method that can be incorporated into the encrypted bilateral control system and is summarized in the presented theorem. Furthermore, this study provides a specific design for reasonable threshold parameters concerning the control system energy.

The declared range of such communication is usually several cm and is characterized by the need to bring the data carrier close to the system reader. Due to the possibility of transmitting sensitive data in this type of system, an important problem seems to be the electromagnetic security of the transmitted data between the cards (tags) and the reader and within the system. In most of the available research studies, the security of RFID systems comes down to the analysis of the effectiveness of encryption of transmitted data or testing the range of communication between the reader and the identifier. In this research, however, special attention is paid to the so-called electromagnetic information security without the analysis of cryptographic protection. In some cases (e.g., data retransmission), encryption may not be an effective method of securing data (because, e.g., encrypted data might be used to open and start a car with a keyless system). In addition, the research draws attention to the fact that the data from the identifier can be accessed not only from the identifier, but also from the control system (reader, wiring, controller, etc.) from which the data can be radiated (unintentionally) at a much greater distance than the communication range between the identifier and the reader. In order to determine the security of the transmitted data in the HF-band RFID systems, a number of tests were carried out with the use of specialized equipment. During the measurements, both the data carriers themselves (cards, key fobs, stickers, tags) and exemplary systems for reading data from the media (a writable card reader, a mobile phone with NFC function, and an extensive access control system) were tested.

The dynamical behaviors of the new system are studied through numerical analysis methods. The results reveal it is extremely sensitive to control parameters as well as initial conditions, which make it particularly suitable for application to image encryption algorithms. In light of these findings, a novel image encryption algorithm is introduced. This algorithm integrates the new four-dimensional chaotic system with ribonucleic acid (RNA) coding technology.

An attacker targeting only specific known-to-be-real accounts might, however, remain undetected. A more effective method proposed by Juels and Rivest at CCS’13 is to maintain additional fake passwords associated with each account. An attacker who gains access to the password file is unable to tell apart real passwords from fake passwords, and the attempted usage of a false password immediately sets off an alarm indicating a password file compromise. Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) has long been recognised for its strong security guarantees when it comes to low-entropy password authentication and secure channel establishment, without having to rely on the setup of a PKI. In this paper, we introduce SweetPAKE, a new cryptographic primitive that offers the same security guarantees as PAKE for key exchange, while allowing clients with a single password to authenticate against servers with n candidate passwords for that account and establish a secure channel. Additional security properties are identified and formalized to ensure that (a) high-entropy session keys are indistinguishable from random, even if later on the long-term secret password becomes corrupted (forward secrecy); (b) upon password file leakage, an adversary cannot tell apart real from fake passwords; and (c) a malicious client cannot trigger a false alarm. We capture these properties by extending well-established game-based definitions of PAKE. Furthermore, we propose a new UC formulation that comprehensively unifies both SweetPAKE (session key indistinguishability and sugarword indistinguishability) and a related notion known as Oblivious-PAKE. Finally, we propose efficient SweetPAKE and Oblivious-PAKE protocols constructed from Password-Authenticated Public-Key Encryption (PAPKE) that satisfy all the proposed notions. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

However, users’ primary worries revolve around maintaining data integrity and authenticity. Consequently, several cloud auditing methods have emerged to address these concerns. Many of these approaches rely on traditional public-key cryptography systems or are grounded in identity-based cryptography systems or certificateless cryptography systems. However, they are vulnerable to the increased costs linked with certificate management, key escrow, or the significant expenses of establishing a secure channel, respectively. To counter these limitations, Li et al. introduced a certificate-based cloud auditing protocol (LZ22), notable for its minimal tag generation overhead. Nonetheless, this protocol exhibits certain security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we devise a counterfeiting technique that allows the CSP to produce a counterfeit data block with an identical tag to the original one. Our counterfeiting method boasts a 100% success rate ∀ data block and operates with exceptional efficiency. The counterfeiting process for a single block of 10 kB, 50 kB, and 100 kB takes a maximum of 0.08 s, 0.51 s, and 1.04 s, respectively. By substituting the exponential component of homomorphic verifiable tags (HVTs) with non-public random elements, we formulate a secure certificate-based cloud auditing protocol. In comparison to the LZ22 protocol, the average tag generation overhead of our proposed protocol is reduced by 6.80%, 13.78%, and 8.66% for data sizes of 10 kB, 50 kB, and 100 kB, respectively. However, the auditing overhead of our proposed protocol shows an increase. The average overhead rises by 3.05%, 0.17%, and 0.45% over the LZ22 protocol’s overhead for data sizes of 10 kB, 50 kB, and 100 kB, correspondingly. © 2024 by the authors."

While there are numerous pre-quantum secure OPRF constructions, it is unclear which of the proposed options for post-quantum secure constructions are practical for modern-day applications. In this work, we focus on isogeny group actions, as the associated low bandwidth leads to efficient constructions. We introduce OPUS, a novel Naor-Reingold-based OPRF from isogenies without oblivious transfer, and show efficient evaluations of the Naor-Reingold PRF using CSIDH and CSI-FiSh. Additionally, we analyze a previous proposal of a CSIDH-based OPRF and that the straightforward instantiation of the protocol leaks the server’s private key. As a result, we propose mitigations to address those shortcomings, which require additional hardness assumptions. Our results report a very competitive protocol when combined with lattices for Oblivious Transfer. Our evaluation shows that OPUS and the repaired, generic construction are competitive with other proposals in terms of runtime efficiency and communication size. More concretely, OPUS achieves almost two orders of magnitude less communication overhead compared to the next-best lattice-based OPRF at the cost of higher latency and higher computational cost, and the repaired construction. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of OPUS and the generic NR-OT in two use cases: first, we instantiate OPAQUE, a protocol for asymmetric authenticated key exchange. Compared to classical elliptic curve cryptography, which is considered insecure in the presence of efficient quantum computers, this results in less than 100 × longer computation on average and around 1000× more communication overhead. Second, we perform an unbalanced private set intersection and show that the communication overhead can be roughly the same when using isogenies or elliptic curves, at the cost of much higher runtime. Conversely, for sets of the size 210, we report a runtime around 200× slower than the elliptic curve PSI. This concretizes the overhead of performing PSI and using OPAQUE with isogenies for the first time. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

Their presence signals that the system may violate the postulates of local realism - conjectures once thought to be to be a non-negotiable property of the physical world. The importance of Bell correlations from this fundamental point of view is even further clarified by their applications, ranging from quantum cryptography to quantum metrology and quantum computing. It is therefore of growing interest to characterize the ""Bell content""of complex, scalable many-body systems. Here, we perform a detailed analysis of the character and strength of many-body Bell correlations in interacting multiqubit systems with particle exchange symmetry. Such a configuration can be described by an effective Schrödinger-like equation, which allows precise analytical predictions. We show that in the vicinity of the quantum critical point, these correlations quickly become so strong that only a fraction of the qubits remain uncorrelated. We also identify the threshold temperature above which thermal fluctuations destroy Bell correlations. We hope that the approach presented here, due to its universality, will be useful for upcoming research on genuinely nonclassical Bell-correlated complex systems.  © 2024 American Physical Society. "

Currently, quantum networks are still in the early stages of small-scale deployment, most of which can only support a single QKD protocol (QKDP). However, with the advancement of various QKDPs, a single-protocol quantum network is no longer sufficient to meet the demands of multiple users, prompting the emergence of multi-protocol quantum networks. Nevertheless, the transition from a single-protocol to a multi-protocol quantum network still faces many challenging issues, such as key negotiation interruptions due to device initialization and channel calibration during protocol updating. To address the quantum key negotiation interruption problem, we propose a seamless key negotiation oriented multi-protocol updating algorithm in this work, which can fulfill the protocol updating requests of different users in quantum metropolitan networks. Furthermore, to better improve network performance while meeting diverse user demands, we propose four heuristic algorithms for optimal QKDP recommendation, focusing on their applications for multi-protocol updating in different types of typical networks. We perform the simulations with different QKDP recommendation algorithms to analyze the impact of the cache time of the key cache area on the key negotiation interruption probability and the time resource utilization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the key negotiation interruption probability by 77.7% while increasing the time resource utilization by 15.3% compared to no key cache area. © 2009-2012 Optica Publishing Group."

With the increase in IoT devices, there emerge many security issues of data loss, privacy leakage, and information temper in IoT network applications. Even with the development of quantum computing, most current information systems are weak to quantum attacks with traditional cryptographic algorithms. This paper first establishes a general security model for these IoT network applications, which comprises the blockchain and a post-quantum secure identity-based signature (PQ-IDS) scheme. This model divides these IoT networks into three layers: perceptual, network, and application, which can protect data security and user privacy in the whole data-sharing process. The proposed PQ-IDS scheme is based on lattice cryptography. Bimodal Gaussian distribution and the discrete Gaussian sample algorithm are applied to construct the fundamental difficulty problem of lattice assumption. This assumption can help resist the quantum attack for information exchange among IoT devices. Meanwhile, the signature mechanism with IoT devices’ identity can guarantee non-repudiation of information signatures. Then, the security proof shows that the proposed PQ-IDS can obtain the security properties of unforgeability, non-repudiation, and non-transferability. The efficiency comparisons and performance evaluations show that the proposed PQ-IDS has good efficiency and practice in IoT network applications. © 2024 by the authors."

In this paper, a novel one-dimensional sine-cosine fractional power chaotic map (SCFP) is proposed. Results of various dynamical system tests illustrate that SCFP exhibits superior chaotic behavior over its infinite positive real parameter range, whose complexity and unpredictability can guarantee the strength of image cryptosystem. Furthermore, a color image encryption scheme tailored for distributed architecture is devised. Firstly, a hybrid cryptographic mechanism is designed to perform diffusion and confusion encryption for image data and ECC public key encryption for intermediate keys. Secondly, the diffusion structure elevates processing units to row-column level, and the diffusion order is dictated by a pseudo-random sequence generated by SCFP. Thirdly, the confusion structure extends the unbiased and efficient Fisher-Yates algorithm into a 2D space, and adopts a design of dual plaintext-related key. Lastly, three techniques namely QOI lossless compression, DE information embedding and threshold secret sharing are integrated to resolve issues of data volume inflation, key synchronization difficulty and poor fault tolerance. Simulation experiments conducted on multiple color images demonstrate that the proposed scheme offers significant ciphertext randomness, sufficiently large key space and strong key sensitivity, which can ensure the integrity of image data and resist various typical cryptographic attacks, and outperforms existing schemes oriented to centralized architecture in terms of security and efficiency. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd."

To address these issues, we propose the Advanced Network-Hiding Access Control (AHAC) framework, designed to enhance security by reducing network environment exposure and providing secure access methods. AHAC introduces an independent control surface as the access proxy service and combines it with a noise generation mechanism for encrypted access schemes, replacing the traditional RSA signature method used in SPA protocols. This framework significantly improves system security, reduces computational costs, and enhances key verification efficiency. The AHAC framework addresses several limitations inherent in SPA: users need to know the IP address of resources in advance, exposing the resource address to potential attacks; SPA’s one-way authentication mechanism is insufficient for multi-level authentication in dynamic environments; deploying the knocking module and protected resources on the same host can lead to resource exhaustion and service unavailability under heavy loads; and SPA often uses high-overhead encryption algorithms like RSA2048. To counter these limitations, AHAC separates the Port Knocking module from the access control module, supports mutual authentication, and implements an extensible two-way communication mechanism. It also employs ECC and ECDH algorithms, enhancing security while reducing computational costs. We conducted extensive experiments to validate AHAC’s performance, high availability, extensibility, and compatibility. The experiments compared AHAC with traditional SPA in terms of time cost and performance. © 2024 by the authors."

The scheme utilizes the pixel ratio of the image as parameters for quantum walks, Henon mapping, and Arnold Cat mapping, approximating the “one-time pad” encryption effect. With this scheme, even when encrypting multiple images using the same parameters, the resulting quantum walks random matrix and chaotic system trajectories are almost completely different. This encryption scheme eliminates the need for quantum representation of the image, thereby conserving quantum resources and reducing implementation complexity. Experimental results show that the scheme can resist statistical analysis, key analysis, noise and occlusion attacks, and has strong key sensitivity and large key space.

In this paper, we describe a new version of boomerang attacks which uses the counterintuitive idea of throwing out most of the data in order to force equalities between certain values on the ciphertext side. In certain cases, this creates a correlation between the four probabilistic events, which increases the probability of the combined property to p2q and increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the resultant distinguisher. We call this variant a retracing boomerang attack since we make sure that the boomerang we throw follows the same path on its forward and backward directions. To demonstrate the power of the new technique, we apply it to the case of 5-round AES. This version of AES was repeatedly attacked by a large variety of techniques, but for twenty years its complexity had remained stuck at 232. At Crypto’18, it was finally reduced to 224 (for full key recovery), and with our new technique, we can further reduce the complexity of full key recovery to the surprisingly low value of 216.5 (i.e., only 90, 000 encryption/decryption operations are required for a full key recovery). In addition to improving previous attacks, our new technique unveils a hidden relationship between boomerang attacks and two other cryptanalytic techniques, the yoyo game and the recently introduced mixture differentials. © The Author(s) 2024."

To ensure that the output of a QRNG is private and nearly uniform, the raw data undergoes a strong extraction process such as Toeplitz or Trevisan Hashing. The extraction process needs to be extremely efficient to achieve high-speed random number generation. The present work demonstrates state-of-the-art methods for performing information-theoretically provable randomness extraction using variations of the Toeplitz Hashing algorithm.

Under standard arguments, we show that the eavesdropper’s decoding complexity grows exponentially with the number of antennas, while the legitimate receiver’s decoding complexity grows only quadratically. The proposed scheme builds a bridge between information-theoretic security and cryptographic security. Compared to the traditional physical-layer security, the proposed scheme is secure when the number of the eavesdropper’s antennas is infinite or much larger than the number of transmitter/receiver antennas, provided that the eavesdropper’s distance from the legitimate receiver is less than one-half of the wavelength, or that the channel estimation process between the sender-receiver pair is broken by the eavesdropper. Because the scheme is based on lattice, not on channel reciprocity, it can be applied to both time-division duplex and frequency-division duplex channels, and utilizes the simple physical layer characteristics of Massive MIMO to resist the currently known quantum attacks. The proposed scheme is adapted to the future requirements of 6G for the security of communication, and provides a new idea for the post-quantum cryptosystem. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme has a decoding bit error rate (BER) close to 0.5 at the eavesdropper and almost 0 at the legitimate receiver. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

External stimuli such as light, heat, electricity, magnetism and pH can alter the output information, while a single stimulus will limit higher levels of anti-counterfeiting. Therefore, multiple stimuli should be synergistically used to enhance information security. In this study, a highly transparent sodium alginate-polyacrylamide (SA-PAM) hydrogel is designed as the matrix. An inorganic color-changing material, ammonium molybdate (Mo7), is used to impart the gel with photochromic characteristics. Furthermore, poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (PNI-PAM), a temperature-sensitive material, makes the gel undergo a bulk phase transition at the lowest critical phase transition temperature (LCST), which in turn alters macroscopic state of the gel. The LCST can also be controlled by adjusting the ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers in the gel system. By using ultraviolet (UV) light as the “ink”, the information is input, and temperature is used as the “switch” to encrypt/decrypt the information. Overall, the hydrogel exhibits excellent photochromic ability and can be colored within 10 s, while exhibiting a maximum UV light absorption rate of 96.23%. The hydrogel can rapidly reveal or conceal the information based on the response of the hydrogel to light and heat stimuli, thus ensuring that the information remains secure.

To address these issues, we introduce an advanced federated Bayesian network (FBN) approach. By integrating federated learning, adaptive optimization algorithms, and homomorphic encryption technologies, we substantially enhanced the efficiency and security of cross-regional air quality data processing. The novelty of this research lies in the improvements implemented in federated learning for air quality data analysis, particularly in distributed model training optimization and data consistency. Through the integration of adaptive structural modification strategies and simulated annealing immune optimization algorithms, we markedly enhanced the structural learning accuracy of the Bayesian network, resulting in a 20% improvement in prediction accuracy. Moreover, employing homomorphic encryption ensured data transmission security and confidentiality. In our Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei case study, our method demonstrated a 15% improvement in air quality classification accuracy compared to conventional methods and exhibited superior interpretability in analyzing environmental factor interactions. We quantified complex air pollution patterns across regions and found that a 30% fluctuation in the air quality index correlated with NO2 concentrations. We also observed a moderate positive correlation between specific pollutant indicators in Hebei Province and Tianjin and changes in air quality. Additionally, the FBN exhibited better operational efficiency and data confidentiality than other machine learning models in handling large-scale and multisource environmental data.

However, encrypted traffic raises new challenges for intrusion detection and network monitoring. Existing interception solutions such as Man-In-The-Middle are undesirable in many settings: they tend to lower overall security or are challenging to use at scale. We present X-Ray-TLS, a new target-agnostic TLS decryption method that supports TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, and QUIC. Our method relies only on existing kernel facilities and does not require a hypervisor or modification of the target programs, making it easily applicable at scale. X-Ray-TLS works on major TLS libraries by extracting TLS secrets from process memory using a memory changes reconstruction algorithm. It works with TLS hardening, such as certificate pinning and perfect forward secrecy. We benchmark X-Ray-TLS on major TLS libraries, CLI tools, and a web browser. We show that X-Ray-TLS significantly reduces the manual effort required to decrypt TLS traffic of programs running locally, thus simplifying security analysis or reverse engineering. We identified several use cases for X-Ray-TLS, such as large-scale TLS decryption for CI/CD pipelines to support the detection of software supply chain attacks. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

However, the practical implementation of a QDS network has many challenges, including complex interference technical requirements, linear channel loss of quantum state transmission, and potential side-channel attacks on detectors. Here, we propose an asynchronous measurement-device-independent (MDI) QDS protocol with asynchronous two-photon interference strategy and one-time universal hashing method. The two-photon interference approach protects our protocol against all detector side-channel attacks and relaxes the difficulty of experiment implementation, while the asynchronous strategy effectively reduces the equivalent channel loss to its square root. Compared to previous MDI-QDS schemes, our protocol shows several orders of magnitude performance improvements and doubling of transmission distance when processing multibit messages.

However, practical storage and encryption technology using these phosphors remains uncommon due to their weak luminescence intensity and the inconvenience of light sources used in encryption and decryption processes. Here, we have developed Sr2MgSiGeO7:Eu2+,Mn2+,Dy3+ phosphor with a super-long PersL beyond 100 h, the higher charge storage capacity and PersL efficiency (17 %) than commercial SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy phosphors by introduction of co-dopant Mn2+. This phosphor exhibits rapid and efficient charging capability when exposed to various light sources such as sunlight, light-emitting diode, mobile phone and computer screen. To explain the high charge storage capacity and super-long PersL, we propose a novel trap mechanism based on hole-electron defect pair trap structures. Notably, this phosphor as an anti-counterfeiting material demonstrates high-order encryption by the adding specific information writing process via temperature management.

This was proven by using a so-called zero-error attack, which relies on an unambiguous state discrimination (USD) measurement. This type of attack allows the eavesdropper to learn the whole secret key without introducing any error. Here, we investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of zero-error attacks against COW QKD with present-day technology. For this, we introduce two practical USD receivers that can be realized with linear passive optical elements, phase-space displacement operations and threshold single-photon detectors. The first receiver is optimal with respect to its success probability, while the second one can impose stronger restrictions on the protocol’s performance with faulty eavesdropping equipment. Our findings suggest that zero-error attacks could break the security of COW QKD even assuming realistic experimental conditions. © 2024 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd."

We assume there are n parties and the adversary corrupts t of them, where 2t < n. In this work, we leverage RMFEs (Reverse Multiplication Friendly Embeddings) to build an MPC protocol over ℤpk with constant online communication. An (l, d)-RMFE packs l elements from ℤpk into an element in GR(pk, d) = ℤpk [X]/ℎ(X), where deg ℎ = d. The existence of asymptotically good RMFE ensures that d/l is bounded by a constant independent of n. We show that the method from Turbopack applies to honest majority secure multiparty computation over ℤpk in the preprocessing model, achieving perfect security and the best online communication complexity. In the semi-honest setting, we build a secure multiparty computation protocol over ℤpk based on the packed Shamir secret-sharing over an extension ring and RMFEs. The online communication requires 12d/l elements per multiplication gate. The communication cost per multiplication gate in the preprocessing phase is Θ(n log n). This is the first protocol over ℤpk such that an arithmetic circuit can be evaluated with overall communication complexity O(1) elements per multiplication gate. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

It can effectively enhance functionalities of vehicles. However, new attack types are also emerging. For example, a driver with the smart key in their pocket can push the start button to start a car. At the same time, security issues in the push-to-start scenario are pervasive, such as smart key forgery. In this study, we propose a vehicle Passive Entry Passive Start (PEPS) system that adopts deep learning algorithms to recognize the driver using the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals measured on the driver’s smart watch. ECG signals are used for personal identification. Smart watches, serving as new smart keys of the PEPS system, can improve convenience and security. In the experiment, we consider commercial smart watches capable of sensing ECG signals. The sample rate and precision are typically lower than those of a 12-lead ECG used in hospitals. The experimental results show that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models achieve the best accuracy score for identity recognition (91%) when a single ECG cycle is used. However, it takes at least 30 min for training. The training of a personalized Auto Encoder model takes only 5 min for each subject. When 15 continuous ECG cycles are sensed and used, this can achieve 100% identity accuracy. As the personalized Auto Encoder model is an unsupervised learning one-class recognizer, it can be trained using only the driver’s ECG signal. This will simplify the management of ECG recordings extremely, as well as the integration of the proposed technology into PEPS vehicles. A FIDO (Fast Identify Online)-like environment for the proposed PEPS system is discussed. Public key cryptography is adopted for communication between the smart watch and the PEPS car. The driver is first verified on the smart watch via local ECG biometric authentication, and then identified by the PEPS car. Phishing attacks, MITM (man in the middle) attacks, and replay attacks can be effectively prevented. © 2024 by the authors."

After conducting a dynamic analysis, it is found that the system exhibits transient chaos and a rare inverse period-doubling bifurcation phenomenon in the bifurcation diagram. The system also exhibits attractor coexistence, with periodic, quasi-periodic, indicating high sensitivity to initial values. These phenomena sufficiently demonstrate the rich dynamical characteristics of chaotic systems. By introducing an impulse function with a cosine function in the foundation of the proposed system, it is found that controllable wing number and staircase burst oscillations occur. Furthermore, the number of wings and oscillation periods vary with changes in parameters, which has significant implications in engineering applications. The circuit design and construction are carried out using the Multisim simulation software, and the digital circuit is realized by using a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). It is found that the simulation results and the actual implementation results are highly consistent with the phase portrait of the system, thus demonstrating the feasibility of the circuit. Finally, by combining the proposed system with a DNA encryption algorithm, a novel image encryption algorithm with multiple layers of encryption is designed, greatly enhancing the security of encrypted images. The security of this encryption algorithm is analyzed in terms of information entropy, key space, correlation, and resistance to attacks. It is found that the proposed encryption algorithm exhibits high confidentiality and resistance to attacks.

Firstly, these methods encrypt each color channel separately, resulting in a time-consuming process and independent encrypted channels, which can make hacking easier. Secondly, the use of XOR operations between image pixel values and code values during encryption can be vulnerable. To address these issues, a novel algorithm is introduced that incorporates a new XOR operation and simultaneous encryption of color channels. This approach creates interdependence between the encrypted channels, reduces encryption time, and enhances security by introducing a more complex XOR operation. The proposed method employs a substitution technique that involves XOR operations between groups of pixels and codes, inspired by the principles of the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform algorithm. The encryption process involves several key phases that enhance the security and efficiency of the system. In the initial phase, line processing involves mixing lines from different channels and application of chaotic substitution permutation operations. Subsequently, a similar operation is applied to columns, and finally, the channels are divided into overlapping squared sub-blocks, with a newly XOR proposed chaos-based confusion operation simultaneously applied to the three-channel sub-blocks. These phases are designed to ensure interdependence between color channels and reduce encryption time, resulting in a more robust encryption method. With this method, the RGB cipher channels become mutually dependent, rendering decryption of one channel impossible without the others. The approach has been evaluated using appropriate metrics and found to be robust, efficient, and resistant to various attacks, outperforming recently published methods. It is suitable for modern image encryption applications, including those related to the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd."

Deep learning-based radio frequency fingerprinting identification (RFFI) is emerging as a key candidate for device identification using hardware-intrinsic features. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the state of the art in the area of deep learning-based radio frequency fingerprinting identification for LoRa devices.

More generally, we apply the advantage distillation method for analyzing the security of QKD with imperfect MUBs, where the error tolerance and transmission distance can be sharply improved.

It provides many known benefits when used in elections, such as minimising vote splitting, ensuring few votes are wasted, and providing resistance to strategic voting. However, the voting and tallying procedures for IRV are much more complicated than those of plurality and are both error-prone and tedious. Many automated systems have been proposed to simplify these procedures in IRV. Some of these also employ cryptographic techniques to protect the secrecy of ballots and enable verification of the tally. Nearly all of these cryptographic systems require a set of trustworthy tallying authorities (TAs) to perform the decryption of votes and/or running of mix servers, which adds significant complexity to the implementation and election management. We address this issue by proposing Camel: an E2E verifiable solution for IRV that requires no TAs. Camel employs a novel representation and a universally verifiable shifting procedure for ballots that facilitate the elimination of candidates as required in an IRV election. We combine these with a homomorphic encryption scheme and zero-knowledge proofs to protect the secrecy of the ballots and enable any party to verify the well-formedness of the ballots and the correctness of the tally in an IRV election. We examine the security of Camel and prove it maintains ballot secrecy by limiting the learned information (namely the tally) against a set of colluding voters. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

Given the popular subculture of traders it has created, and its implications for financial markets and monetary policy, scholars have recently begun to examine the political, psychological, and social characteristics of cryptocurrency investors. A review of the existing literature suggests that cryptocurrency owners may possess higher-than-average levels of nonnormative psychological traits and exhibit a range of non-mainstream political identities. However, this extant literature typically employs small nonrepresentative samples of respondents and examines only a small number of independent variables in each given study. This presents the opportunity for both further testing of previous findings as well as broader exploratory analyses including more expansive descriptive investigations of cryptocurrency owners. To that end, we polled 2,001 American adults in 2022 to examine the associations between cryptocurrency ownership and individual level political, psychological, and social characteristics. Analyses revealed that 30% of our sample have owned some form of cryptocurrency and that these individuals exhibit a diversity of political allegiances and identities. We also found that crypto ownership was associated with belief in conspiracy theories, “dark” personality characteristics (e.g., the “Dark Tetrad” of narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism), and more frequent use of alternative and fringe social media platforms. When examining a more comprehensive multivariate model, the variables that most strongly predict cryptocurrency ownership are being male, relying on alternative/fringe social media as one’s primary news source, argumentativeness, and an aversion to authoritarianism. These findings highlight numerous avenues for future research into the people who buy and trade cryptocurrencies and speak to broader global trends in anti-establishment attitudes and nonnormative behaviors.

Recent research has shown the feasibility of identifying video titles from encrypted network traffic within a single platform, for example, within YouTube or Facebook. However, there are no existing methods for cross-platform video recognition, a crucial gap that this works aims to address. Encrypted video traffic classification within a single platform, that is, classifying the video title of a traffic trace of a video on one platform by training on traffic traces of videos on the same platform, has significant limitations due to the large number of video platforms available to users to upload harmful content to. To attempt to address this limitation, we conduct a feasibility analysis into and attempt to solve the challenge of recognizing videos across multiple platforms by using the traffic traces of videos on one platform only. We propose TripletViNet, a framework that encompasses i) platform-wise pre-processing, ii) an encoder trained utilizing triplet learning for improved accuracy and iii) multiclass classifier for classifying the video title of a traffic trace. To evaluate the performance of TripletViNet, a comprehensive dataset with traffic traces for 100 videos on six major platforms with the potential for spreading misinformation such as YouTube, X, Instagram, Facebook, Rumble, and Tumblr was collected and used to test TripletViNet in both closed-set and open-set scenarios. TripletViNet achieves significant improvements in accuracy due to the correlation between video traffic and the video's VBR, with impressive final accuracies exceeding 90% in certain scenarios.

Many efforts have been made to provide mixing services for either non-confidential or confidential payments. For confidential payments, all the known mixing protocols are designed for confidential blockchains using homomorphic commitment. There is, however, no satisfactory solution for confidential blockchains using public key encryption (PKE), such as PGC and Zether. This work proposes the first universal mixing protocol for confidential blockchains built upon homomorphic PKE. We provide formal security definitions, and prove that the mixing protocol satisfies all the security requirements. Moreover, we present BlindShuffler, an instantiation of the universal mixing protocol. The evaluation shows that when applying BlindShuffler to PGC, notably lower cost is needed to achieve the same level of anonymity compared with other solutions, and it becomes more advantageous with the increase of the anonymous level. As an independent contribution in the building of BlindShuffer, we improve the state-of-the-art standard one-out-of-many proof to support heterogeneous public keys and construct an enhancement with logarithmic membership proof length. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

However, these reductions are often difficult to interpret and use, due to the complexity of their parameters and analysis, and most especially their (frequently large) blowup and distortion of the error distributions. In this paper, we unify and simplify this line of work. First, we give a general framework that encompasses all proposed LWE variants (over commutative base rings) and in particular unifies all prior “algebraic” LWE variants defined over number fields. We then use this framework to give much simpler, more general, and tighter reductions from Ring-LWE to other algebraic LWE variants, including Module-LWE, Order-LWE, and Middle-Product LWE. In particular, all of our reductions have easy-to-analyze and frequently small error expansion; in most cases, they even leave the error unchanged. A main message of our work is that it is straightforward to use the hardness of the original Ring-LWE problem as a foundation for the hardness of all other algebraic LWE problems defined over number fields, via simple and rather tight reductions. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2024."

KDFs are broadly used in various security protocols such as digital signatures and key exchange protocols. HKDF, the most deployed KDF in practice, is based on the extract-then-expand paradigm. It is presently used, among others, in the Signal Protocol for end-to-end encrypted messaging. HKDF is a generic KDF for general input sources and thus is not optimized for source-specific use cases such as key derivation from Diffie-Hellman (DH) sources (i.e. DH shared secrets as key material). Furthermore, the sequential HKDF design is unnecessarily slow on some general-purpose platforms that can benefit from parallelization. In this work, we propose a novel, efficient and secure KDF called Skye. Skye follows the extract-then-expand paradigm and consists of two algorithms: efficient deterministic randomness extractor and expander functions. Instantiating our extractor for dedicated source-specific (e.g. DH sources) inputs leads to a significant efficiency gain over HKDF while maintaining its security level. We provide concrete security analysis of Skye and both its underlying algorithms in the standard model. We provide a software performance comparison of Skye with the AES-based expanding PRF ButterKnife and HKDF with SHA-256 (as used in practice). Our results show that in isolation Skye performs from 4x to 47x faster than HKDF, depending on the availability of AES or SHA instruction support. We further demonstrate that with such a performance gain, when Skye is integrated within the current Signal implementation, we can achieve significant overall improvements ranging from 38% to 64% relative speedup in unidirectional messaging. Even in bidirectional messaging, that includes DH computation with dominating computational cost, Skye still contributes to 12-36% relative speedup when just 10 messages are sent and received at once. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

However, the current meta-holograms primarily focus on half-space manipulation, posing a challenge in developing simplified meta-hologram structures for spatial multiplexing. To address this situation, what we believe to be a novel 4-bit “Janus” metasurface combined with the weighted Gerchberg-Saxton (WGS) algorithm is proposed to record and reconstruct two distinct images in millimeter wave band. By meticulously designing the single-layer units, the 4-bit Janus metasurface achieves independent amplitude and phase responses in two orthogonal information channels. Moreover, the imaging ability of the proposed metasurface is investigated under different amplitude and phase dispersion. Comparative analysis also highlights several notable advantages of our work, including a low-profile design, polarization-frequency multiplexing, and enhanced imaging efficiency. The proposed method is verified through theoretical calculations, simulations, and experiments, and promises a versatile platform for applications in data storage, encryption, and auxiliary sensing. © 2024 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement."

Existing security and privacy research work focuses on cryptography, either which is less efficient, or it majorly focuses on securing the network, which further leads to exposing the nodes to the vulnerability in terms of privacy in the network. This research develops condition-based distributed privacy-preserving (CDPP) approach to preserve the sensor node privacy; the CDPP algorithm develops a condition based on which the nodes' vulnerable information is preserved and not accessed by the compromised nodes. CDPP architecture is evaluated considering the amount of misclassified nodes for safeguarding the node in the network. CDPP is evaluated by inducing the corrupt nodes and further comparing the model with existing low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) based on classification, misclassification and throughput.

The resultant material exhibits stimulus responsiveness; the RTP properties disappear when the material is exposed to water vapor, but are restored following thermal treatment.

In this paper, we propose a novel identity authenticated Key Agreement Scheme (KAS) for IoT environments based on Hyper Elliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) and Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) built on four co-prime integers. The distributed CRT four co-prime based KAS permits multiple shared keys between devices which facilitates a subset construction with much greater device support and having full connectivity till depth four and overall better connectivity till greater depths than its two co-prime counterpart. We develop an efficient authentication mechanism based on HECC that has much smaller key sizes than most existing cryptosystems. The authentication part treats devices identities related to CRT four co-prime KAS as secret information during their exchange and thereby eliminates the well known selective device attack (SDA). We compute the standard resiliency measure, fail(s) with s=1 for our authenticated CRT four co-prime KAS. Proposed scheme are secure against a variety of attacks, including reply attack, impersonation attack, user anonymity.

Unfortunately, after analyzing security, the PCAS scheme fails to satisfy the necessary unlinkability in VANETs and is vulnerable to the public key replacement forgery attack of the Type-I adversary. Subsequently, this article analyzes the causes of these two security issues in detail and proposes an improved CLAS scheme for VANETs (called IPCAS). Through security analysis, this article proves that the IPCAS is existentially unforgeable under the adaptive chosen message attacks against Type-I and Type-II adversaries in the random oracle model, and satisfies the necessary security and privacy requirements in VANETs, including unlinkability. Finally, the performance analysis results show that compared to PCAS for single message and n aggregate messages (n=1000), the computational overhead of IPCAS is reduced by 20.01% and 49.08% respectively, and the communication overhead is reduced by 18.75% and 28.14% respectively.

The main goal is to speed up web traffic via HTTP, but it is also used in other areas like tunneling. Based on UDP, it offers features like reliable in-order delivery, flow and congestion control, stream-based multiplexing, and always-on encryption using TLS 1.3. Unlike TCP, QUIC integrates these capabilities in user space, relying on kernel interaction solely for UDP. Operating in user space allows more flexibility but sacrifices some kernel-level efficiency and optimization that TCP benefits from. Various QUIC implementations exist, each distinct in programming language, architecture, and design. QUIC is already widely deployed on the Internet and has been evaluated, focussing on low latency, interoperability, and standard compliance. However, benchmarks on high-speed network links are still scarce. This paper presents an extension to the QUIC Interop Runner, a framework for testing the interoperability of QUIC implementations. Our contribution enables reproducible QUIC benchmarks on dedicated hardware and high-speed links. We provide results on 10G links, including multiple implementations, evaluate how OS features like buffer sizes and NIC offloading impact QUIC performance, and show which data rates can be achieved with QUIC compared to TCP. Moreover, we analyze different CPUs and CPU architectures influence reproducible and comparable performance measurements. Furthermore, our framework can be applied to evaluate the effects of future improvements to the protocol or the OS. Our results show that QUIC performance varies widely between client and server implementations from around 50 Mbit/s to over 6000 Mbit/s. We show that the OS generally sets the default buffer size too small. Based on our findings, the buffer size should be increased by at least an order of magnitude. Our profiling analysis identifies Packet I/O as the most expensive task for QUIC implementations. Furthermore, QUIC benefits less from AES NI hardware acceleration while both features improve the goodput of TCP to around 8000 Mbit/s. The lack of support for NIC offloading from QUIC implementations results in missed opportunities for performance improvement. The assessment of CPUs from different vendors and generations revealed significant performance variations. We employed core pinning to examine if the performance of QUIC implementations is affected by the allocation to specific CPU cores. The results indicated an increased goodput of up to 20% when running on a specifically chosen core compared to a randomly assigned core. This outcome highlights the impact of CPU core selection on the performance of QUIC implementations but also for reproducible measurements. © 2024 The Author(s)"

To solve these problems, we construct a new certificateless blind signcryption from NTRU lattice (NTRUL-CLBSC) suitable for e-cash. NTRUL-CLBSC has low communication overhead and high calculation efficiency because of small storage space and short key size in number theory research unit (NTRU) lattice.

Due to the existence of equivalent key in the plaintext-independent type, it can usually be deciphered by simply using chosen-plaintext attacks. Recently, some plaintext-related chaotic ciphers have been proposed for improving the security performance. However, it is found that under the premise of predictability and reconfiguration of plaintext-related quantities, chosen-plaintext/ciphertext attacks can still remain valid. But if the above-mentioned conditions do not hold true, it is not possible for chosen-plaintext/ciphertext attacks to decipher the generalized plaintext-related chaotic ciphers. Therefore, it is necessary for cryptanalysts to discover some new analytical approaches. To further explore the problem, this paper proposes initially the divide-and-conquer attack on this type of plaintext-related chaotic ciphers,and takes the cryptanalysis on the latest similar scheme as an example to illustrate the main idea. Armed with the divide-and-conquer strategy, the related pixels are deciphered firstly. Then, the remainder pixels can also be deciphered followed by the chosen-plaintext attack, difference method, S-box strategy, and removing diffusion effect. Meanwhile, an improved scheme is also given to eliminate potential flaw, which have no need of additional plaintext information for decryption, but also can resist against divide-and-conquer attack.

Thus, extensive research on the existing studies enforcing and governing access control has been conducted. The methodologies used in the existing CPABE (bilinear pairing cryptography based) schemes to revoke users at the system and attribute levels have been focused on in the current study. The existing studies have been examined on the basis of the following parameters for revocation: type of revocation addressed, level of collusion resistance, dynamicity achieved, scalability of revocation, and computational cost incurred. It has been observed in the study that no single scheme achieves all the revocation properties and addresses both types of revocation. The module proposed in proxy-based and collusion-resistant multi-authority revocable CPABE (PCMR-CPABE) efficiently addresses both types of revocation and is fully collusion-resistant, dynamic, and scalable. The present paper extends the study on PCMR-CPABE and presents a performance analysis of the module in terms of functional specifications and computational cost. The presented analysis has compared the performance of the existing cutting-edge schemes with the PCMR-CPABE module and has proved that the proposed module is better in terms of functionality and is computationally inexpensive. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

However, in today’s research, issues relating to the safety concerned with the large amount of information have emerged as a crucial topic due to the internet openings. Since images are regarded as significant components of network communication, the information security of images is highly vital. In this paper, an image processing concept along with authenticated cloud storage is proposed which includes the enhanced processing of input images and their secured storage. The processed input images undergo authentication procedures in which the algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt the image information is the Nth Degree Truncated Polynomial Ring Unit (NTRU). It performs a rapid generation of 128 bit private key and verification achieving improved performance and thereby preventing the unauthorized access of information. The processed image is encrypted and stored in the cloud using the proposed algorithm. Only an authorized person is permitted to do accessible secret measures to decrypt the document from the cloud. Meanwhile, the proposed schemes show more efficient and secure one to analyze the security, which are done in the assessment of performance of the system generating improved values of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean-square error (MSE) indicating 5.24 and 82.10, respectively.

In this work, a dynamic photo-enhanced RTP material is prepared by doping 1,8-naphthalic anhydride (NA) into the polyacrylic acid (PAA) matrix. After 10 min irradiation of 302 nm UV light, the RTP properties of the doping systems PAA-NA are significantly enhanced and the photo-enhanced performances show excellent reversibility. More interestingly, PAA-NA as energy donor and the commercial dye rhodamine B (RhB) as energy acceptor are used to construct the ternary doping systems PAA-NA-RhB, which exhibit color-tunable long afterglow from orange to red through the triplet-to-singlet Förster resonance energy transfer (TS-FRET) process. Significantly, RhB as the intermediate and near infrared (NIR) dye Nile blue (NiB) as energy acceptor are codoped into energy donor PAA-NA matrices to facilely prepare the quaternary doping systems PAA-NA-RhB-NiB, and persistent NIR luminescence is realized successfully via the stepwise FRET process after 10 min irradiation of 302 nm UV light. The great application potential of the prepared photo-enhanced PAA-based RTP materials in high-level information encryption has been confirmed due to their excellent RTP performance.

With the rapid development of quantum computers and quantum algorithms, classical cryptographic algorithms become vulnerable to attacks by adversaries, leading to significant risks in IoT communication systems. Numerous lattice-based authentication key agreement (AKA) schemes have emerged to fortify communication systems against quantum attacks. However, due to the large size of the lattice cryptography public key, an excessive number of communication rounds can cause significant time delays. Meanwhile, many current lattice-based AKA schemes rely on weak security models like BR, CK, and ROR. These models can only capture partial adversary attacks.

Privacy-preserving authentication is required, even when the sensors roam between different networks. Existing authentication protocols rely on centralized authentication servers and pose a number of challenges, including a single point of failure, performance bottlenecks, scalability challenges, and privacy concerns. Hence, a secure mutual authentication mechanism using Blockchain is essential in preventing attacks. In this paper, an Improved Chain Code Blockchain-based Key Agreement Authentication Mechanism (CCBKAAM) using the merits of SM9-based Secure Threshold Ring Signature (SM9-STRS) is proposed for achieving privacy and security. This proposed mechanism uses multiple key generation-based cipher identification algorithms for parameter maintenance. The integrated threshold ring signature prevents the limitations of the single key generation scheme. It uses Chain Codes over the Ethereum network for constructing the blocks during the process of mutual user authentication with trust equity score-based Improved PBFT Voting protocol for reaching consensus during authentication. This authentication protocol adopted blockchain for the objective of storing the identities and associated parameters to support the entities under communication during the process of authentication. The formal and informal verification of the proposed CCBKAAM confirmed its potentiality in resisting most of the possible attacks the IoMT is vulnerable to. The communication and computation overhead during the implementation are determined to be significantly lowered by 32.19% and 28.94%, better than the compared baseline blockchain-based mutual authentication. The performance analysis proved that this proposed CCBKAAM scheme is also potent in minimizing the storage overhead up to maximized level of 35.42%. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

The traditional text encryption methods only encrypt text into the garbled code. Although the encrypted text appears to be garbled, there may be text length exposure and semantic preservation. Attackers can use these information leakages to analyze and attack. Therefore, in order to confuse the attackers, we propose a technique to encrypt the text into the image in which it can hide the information that may be exposed in the ciphertext such as text length, language structure, frequency distribution, etc. It mainly uses coordinate substitution encryption and image encryption to encrypt text into image. First, the text is encrypted using coordinate substitution to initially disrupt the correlation between characters. Second, the encrypted text is converted to ASCII values and presented as the image. It is then multiplied with the Hankel matrix to adjust its elements values close to the true range of pixel values. Finally, the two-dimensional polynomial chaotic system and the image encryption algorithm are combined to obfuscate and diffusion encrypt images.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a cross-heterogeneous multichain data access control scheme based on attributes and threshold homomorphic encryption, achieving fine-grained and secure cross-domain access control in cross-chain networks. This scheme uses the threshold Paillier cryptosystem to encrypt and conceal user attributes and access policies. Through smart contracts, homomorphic differential computation is performed on the ciphertext of policies and attributes, to protect data privacy. This solution leverages private key decryption shares from multiple relay nodes in the cross-chain network to jointly decrypt the computation results, providing secure access control in complex cross-chain scenarios. Security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme ensures security with reasonable computational overhead, to meet the access control requirements in cross-chain networks. © 2024"

The performance and the computation cost of security algorithms hinder providing a secure real-time environment for IoT. This study proposes a novel two-layer cryptosystem, Cryptographic Harris Hawks Optimization (CryptoHHO), for Fog–Cloud architecture that reduces security overheads while maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The first layer of the proposed CryptoHHO is responsible for generating a highly randomized key using HHO to optimize Shannon entropy incorporation with transfer functions and a binarization mechanism. The second layer of CryptoHHO introduces a novel encipher model for encryption and decryption based on the Shift cipher, XOR operator, and an instance of crossover and mutation. The job execution avenue, i.e., Fog or cloud computing, is selected depending on the size of IoT requests, security sensitivity, and time sensitivity. The performance of CryptoHHO is compared against other emerging bio-inspired cryptographic algorithms. It was found that the CryptoHHO performs better than CryptoSSA, CryptoGWO, CryptoPSO, and CryptoWOA algorithms based on entropy, key generation time, transfer function comparison, execution time, and throughput. Further, the robustness of CryptoHHO is examined by various security analyses like brute-force attack resistivity, confusion-diffusion, CIA achievement, and statistical evaluations suggested by NIST and FIPS. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

However, due to resource limitations, the confidentiality, integrity and communication cost issues of sensing data have not been well coordinated and resolved in the actual MCS data collection process. In this regard, this paper proposes an edge computing-assisted MCS Chaotic Compressed Sensing Secure Data Collection scheme (CCS-SDC), which supports the secure collection of sensing data and saves communication cost. In CCS-SDC, workers first use the encryption algorithm based on chaos theory to encrypt the collected sensing data, and then adopt the hash location algorithm based on chaos theory to calculate the corresponding hash verification code of the sensing data. After receiving the encrypted sensing data transmitted by the worker, the edge server recomputes the hash verification code of the encrypted sensing data and verifies the integrity of the data, which can locate the changed sensing task data to a certain extent. Then the sensing data is compressed and sampled based on the generated chaos measurement matrix to reduce the amount of data transmission and further enhance the confidentiality of the sensing data. In addition, the same hash positioning algorithm is used between the edge server and the sensing platform to protect data integrity. For the changed data located by integrity verification, in addition to choosing to let workers re-sense and submit, the sensing platform can also choose to discard the changed sensing data under appropriate circumstances, and still reconstruct and decrypt the remaining data through the proposed algorithm to obtain effective original sensing data. The experimental evaluation results on real data sets show that CCS-SDC achieves the best effects, not only achieving lower sensing data communication cost than other related schemes, but also better protecting the confidentiality and integrity of sensing data, which is very useful for resource-constrained MCS data collection scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

This paper proposed a speech encryption algorithm based on robust chaotic mapping, which mainly utilizes the nonlinearities and dynamics of robust chaos to adapt to the characteristics of speech signals. Furthermore, a new 3D sine robust chaotic mapping (3D-SRCM) model is proposed in this paper, which effectively solves the problems of discontinuous parameter ranges, prone to chaotic degradation and lack of robustness in existing chaotic systems, and improves the robustness and complexity of chaos. In the speech encryption algorithm, the parameters of the chaotic mapping are adjusted according to the changes in speech signal characteristics to generate unique keys for different speech signals. The encryption algorithm compresses and denoises the signal through the Fast Walsh–Hadamard Transform (FWHT) before using chaotic sequences for initial scrambling encryption. Then, the signal is transformed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to realize the second round of scrambling and diffusion encryption. This structure increases the security of the encryption algorithm and ensures the efficiency and reliability of the encryption process. The experimental results show that the algorithm has a large key space, good resistance to exhaustive attack, and statistical attack, which can effectively resist chosen plaintext attack.

Since the satellite's communication is wireless, communication security is a critical factor to ensure accountable communication. Key exchange and authentication (KEA) mechanism is widely used to achieve data security for data transmitted in an insecure or open channel. Different authentication systems are suggested in the last many years to establish safe communication, whereas most existing security protocols are based on factorization or discrete logarithm. However, these systems are no longer reliable by Shor's algorithm as any discrete logarithm and factorization can be resolved in polynomial time on quantum computers. Thus, developing a quantum secure KEA protocol for MSC systems is necessary. In this direction, recently a ring learning with an error-based KEA technique is proposed to ensure a quantum-safe environment. This scheme is quantum-safe and satisfies desirable security attributes but has low efficiency in computation and communication. Moreover, establishing a secure session requires six communications among involved entities. As a result, replay attack detection at an early stage is not possible for the central authority (server), which could delay the server response, and the adversary gets the advantage of drawing a denial of service scenario for authorized entities. We propose a lattice-based KEA protocol for the MSC system to improve computation, communication efficiency, and early-stage replay attack detection. The security analysis of the proposed scheme is presented in the random oracle model. Calculation of performance is also presented to observe advantages in computation and communication overhead. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Data sharing in VANET can be achieved using such communications as Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle-to-Cloud (V2C). However, due to the openness of VANET, if an adversary can access shared data without authorization, it will seriously threaten vehicle safety and user privacy, and bring great challenges to data sharing. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an efficient access control scheme for secure data sharing in cloud-assisted VANET. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) can achieve fine-grained access control. However, the traditional access control schemes for VANET rarely consider attack detection and policy privacy protection, and the efficiency is low. Therefore, this article proposes an ABE access control scheme combining intrusion detection and policy hiding, which can filter malicious users and realize secure and efficient data access control under privacy protection. Firstly, partial policy hiding is realized by anonymizing policy attribute values. Secondly, a deep learning model is constructed by sparse stacked autoencoder (SSAE) and a three-layer bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network to detect user data access request packets and effectively filter malicious users. Thirdly, based on the edge structure, complex operations are delegated to the road side unit (RSU) with verifiable outsourced encryption and decryption to reduce the computational and storage overhead of the vehicle. Finally, the security of the proposed ABE scheme is proved. In addition, experimental results show that compared with other schemes, the proposed scheme has higher efficiency while ensuring security. © 2014 IEEE."

Hence data sent through wireless sensor networks are to be protected.

Here, the VANET systems that exist nowadays have issues regarding user privacy and authentication. In internal vehicles, the fake message broadcasting should be stopped to protect the vulnerability of these vehicles from privacy issues. Additionally, the traditional manner of storing transmitted data lacks a decentralized and distributed security system, making it easily vulnerable for third parties to provoke malicious activities within the VANET system. VANET is an autonomous and open-access network, so, privacy and security are the main issues. Hence, it is essential to rectify the complications that are present in the traditional security and privacy preservation models in the VANET system. Thus, an innovative privacy preservation and security scheme with fog enabled VANET system is implemented by considering the complications in the existing models. The major that take place in the recommended framework are (a) Node Authentication, (b) Privacy Preservation, and (c) Message Verification. Initially, the node authentication is performed in the recommended framework using an Adaptive Deep Bayesian network (ADBN) in order to ensure an enhanced permissibility rate in the vehicular node. Then, messages are authenticated to protect the virtue of the messages. The parameters in the ADBN are tuned using the aid of Integrated Fire Hawk with Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (IFHTSA). Next, the privacy preservation procedure in the VANET model is carried out using Hybrid Attribute-Based Advanced Encryption Standard (HABAES) encryption techniques. The keys obtained on the encryption of the messages are signed digitally. Moreover, the suggested model utilized the fog node for the analysis instead of Road-Side Units (RSUs), because of its effectiveness in minimizing the latency rate with an increased throughput rate. In the message verification node, once the Fog Edge Node (FEN) receives the signed message from the vehicles, then it checks the validity of the vehicle node by comparing it with the signed messages.

In particular, polynomial convolution is one of the most time-consuming operations in lattice-based cryptography. To achieve efficient implementation, the number theoretic transform (NTT) algorithm is an ideal choice, but it has certain limitations on the parameters, which not all lattice-based schemes can employ directly. Hence, alternative techniques are proposed to accelerate polynomial convolution on lattice-based schemes that cannot utilize the NTT directly. In this article, we propose a parallel Toeplitz matrix-vector product (TMVP) version to accelerate the polynomial convolution in post-quantum cryptography algorithms implemented it on a graphics processing unit (GPU). This is the first time a TMVP parallel version has been proposed and experimented on different GPU cores (i.e., CUDA-cores and Tensor-cores). The effectiveness of the proposed solution is validated on Saber (the National Institute of Standards and Technology post-quantum standardization finalist) and Sable (an improved version of Saber) schemes. Experimental results show that TMVP-based polynomial convolution using CUDA-cores fails to exhibit a significant enhancement compared to the schoolbook CUDA-core method already proposed by Hafeez et al. in 2023. However, when the TMVP technique is applied to Tensor-cores, it outperformed state-of-the-art implementations. The proposed Tensor-core approach outperformed the schoolbook Tensor-core method by up to 1.21× , and outperformed the dot-product-instructions method (Lee et al. in 2022) by up to 3.63×. The proposed TMVP Tensor-cores is also faster than the TMVP CUDA-cores method by 13.76×.  © 2014 IEEE."

The main idea of these healthcare systems is to provide data security, interaction between entities, efficient data transfer, and sustainability. However, privacy concerning patient information is a fundamental problem in smart healthcare systems. Many authentications and critical management protocols exist in the literature for healthcare systems, but ensuring security still needs to be improved. Even if security is achieved, it still requires fast communication and computations. In this paper, we have introduced a new secure privacy-enhanced fast authentication key management scheme that effectively applies to lightweight resource-constrained devices in healthcare systems to overcome the issue. The proposed framework is applicable for quick authentication, efficient key management between the entities, and minimising computation and communication overheads. We verified our proposed framework with formal and informal verification using BAN logic, Scyther simulation, and the Drozer tool.

Cyberattacks are on the rise since aggregated datasets from multiple vehicles may contain a significant amount of information related to privacy. Federated learning (FL) has gained more attention as it enables data training on local devices without sharing the actual datasets. However, there are still challenges to security, privacy, and heavy communication overhead when applying FL to the IoV. To cope with these issues, we propose a new privacy-enhanced data aggregation scheme based on FL. We apply not only additive secret sharing (ASS) with homomorphic encryption (HE) but also asymmetric encryption such as RSA to guarantee the privacy and security of aggregation results. In our proposed scheme, a roadside unit (RSU), which serves as a group leader, groups vehicles and then chooses qualifying vehicles to not only ensure efficiency with high accuracy but also to reduce communication overhead and improve the scalability of a large number of vehicles. After the initial training that involves all RSUs and selected vehicles, only a randomly selected group is able to update the global model parameter by reflecting on training their local model. It is also helpful not only to reduce communication overhead while keeping acceptable prediction errors but also to prevent continuous receiving from malicious vehicles. The results of security and performance evaluations demonstrate that our proposed scheme is effective in enhancing privacy and efficient in operation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The growing frequency of cybercrime, terrorism-related offenses, and illegal trades in the European Union (EU) has driven LEAs to explore novel LI techniques that align with the developing 5G and Beyond 5G network architectures. Moreover, the emergence of extremely dynamic and distributed networks, the increased usage of end-to-end encryption applications, and privacy protections present limitations for traditional LI approaches. In order to provide a technological solution capable of extending the 3GPP LI standard, this paper presents a novel LI framework designed on top of the standardized 3GPP LI architecture, leveraging an inspection-friendly end-to-end cryptography mechanism (e.g., a Key Escrow algorithm) at the application layer. Moreover, the proposed Lawful Interception (LI) framework enables authorized LEAs to decrypt intercepted end-to-end encrypted data within the core network. Firstly, a security proof validates the security of the proposed LI framework under two attack scenarios. Subsequently, a proof-of-concept workstation implementation that emulates a 5G network for end-to-end data exchange and cloud-based deployment validates the suggested LI framework by affirming the LEA capabilities in decrypting intercepted data. Additionally, the system performance has been studied through experimental tests, ensuring the scalability of the conceived solution and revealing the possibility of intercepting data with mainly real-time latency without affecting the Quality of Service (QoS) experienced by the user. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Therefore, we proposed a federated learning scheme for hierarchical protection and multiple aggregation. Firstly, the client contribution is calculated and compared with the threshold. The local model update is discarded, disturbed, or encrypted according to the comparison result. Secondly, the server adjusts the selection weights of clients and aggregates the disturbed and the encrypted local model updates respectively. Finally, the client gets the final global model by decryption and aggregation. Compared with other schemes, the scheme shows the highest accuracy of 86.15 %, the second lowest communication traffic of 170,261,072 bytes, and the training time is only 3112 s.

To this end, based on HNNs and memristors, a memristive Hopfield switching neural network (MHSNN) is constructed. Firstly, two memristive Hopfield neural networks (MHNNs) are combined into an MHNN with switching topology by designing a weight-switching mechanism. Then, a bias-switching mechanism is designed subsequently according to the states of the neurons, thereby constructing the MHSNN. It is found that the designed switching functions enable the MHSNN to generate 8-to-12–16–20-scroll chaotic attractors. The dynamics analyses verify the existence of the MSCAs, it also exhibits two interesting dynamics phenomena: (1) the number and distribution of the scrolls correspond to the number and the location of the unstable index-2 saddle-focuses (USFs-2); (2) the number of branches in the bifurcation diagrams is half of the number of the scrolls. Moreover, the digital circuit of the MHSNN is designed and verified with the help of a field programmable gate array (FPGA), and the experimental results are displayed on an oscilloscope. Finally, due to the fact that the constructed MHSNN can generate chaotic sequences with higher randomness, an MHSNN-based image encryption scheme is proposed, some comparisons with existing methods verify that the proposed encryption scheme has the advantages of fast operation and easy implementation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024."

The proposed improved Lorenz chaotic system addresses the problem of applying the Lorenz chaotic system to image encryption, resulting in weak chaotic characteristics and susceptibility to reconstruction. Dynamic analysis, sensitivity analysis, and randomness testing demonstrate that the improved Lorenz chaotic system exhibits hyperchaotic characteristics, with a maximum Lyapunov exponent of 2.9897. Based on the improved Lorenz chaotic system, this paper proposes an image encryption method that combines image pyramid structure permutation and Galois field diffusion. Unlike most of the current permutation methods limited to a single image layer, this paper proposes a multilayer permutation method based on the image pyramid structure to enhance the permutation effect of image encryption. Although diffusion based on Galois field multiplication operation is efficient and secure, it is less effective in encrypting pixel points with a pixel value of '0′. To address this issue, this paper incorporates DNA computing into diffusion based on Galois field operations, enabling even pure black images to achieve better encryption effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that the encryption method proposed in this paper effectively conceals information contained in the plain image. The global Shannon entropy of the encrypted Lena image can reach 7.9975, indicating a high level of randomness and complexity. Notably, even a slight alteration, such as changing a single pixel, results in a significant divergence, with 99.6307 % of the cipher image's pixels being distinct. Moreover, it effectively withstands analysis from various attacks. Therefore, the encryption method proposed in this paper can be effectively applied to grayscale image encryption scenarios requiring relatively high security and encryption efficiency, such as remote sensing image encryption and personal privacy image encryption. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

In this paper, we propose a Practical Fuzzy Deduplication (PFDup) algorithm for encrypted multimedia data and it is secure against brute-force guessing attacks without additional independent severs. With our secure fuzzy deduplication technology, cloud storage can be significantly optimized by using Perceptual Hash (phash) to eliminate large quantities of identical even the similar multimedia data in a secure manner.

To address these issues, this article introduces a fine-grained secure approximate image retrieval (FSAIR) scheme for mobile cloud computing. Our approach implements a multiverification architecture that provides precise identity control and an untraceable strategy. Furthermore, FSAIR constructs a flexible and secure hierarchical structure to support the efficient retrieval of large-scale high-dimensional data. By introducing Bloom filters to replace index nodes, FSAIR ensures system efficiency and employs bit-pattern encoding descriptors to search approximate data without violating privacy.

This advancement has substantially bolstered industry autonomy, fortifying security and safety through the integration of electronics, internet connectivity, advanced algorithms, and cutting-edge processing chips.

Specifically, it synthesizes pertinent studies encompassing AI's impact on car emissions, predictive maintenance, security, and the realm of connected vehicles. While AGVs can utilize AI algorithms to chart emission-efficient routes and engineer energy-conservative vehicles, AI, through diverse algorithms, proficiently anticipates component failures, substantially enhancing the cost-effectiveness of predictive maintenance and bolstering vehicle reliability.

The main focus of this work is on exploring short pairing-based NIZKs for all NP languages based on standard assumptions. In this regime, the seminal work of Groth, Ostrovsky, and Sahai (J.ACM’12) (GOS-NIZK) is still considered to be the state-of-the-art. Although fairly efficient, one drawback of GOS-NIZK is that the proof size is multiplicative in the circuit size computing the NP relation. That is, the proof size grows by O(|C|κ), where C is the circuit for the NP relation and κ is the security parameter. By now, there have been numerous follow-up works focusing on shortening the proof size of pairing-based NIZKs, however, thus far, all works come at the cost of relying either on a non-standard knowledge-type assumption or a non-static q-type assumption. Specifically, improving the proof size of the original GOS-NIZK under the same standard assumption has remained as an open problem. Our main result is a construction of a pairing-based NIZK for all of NP whose proof size is additive in |C|, that is, the proof size only grows by |C|+poly(κ), based on the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption over specific pairing-free groups and decisional linear (DLIN) assumption. As by-products of our main result, we also obtain the following two results: (1) We construct a perfectly zero-knowledge NIZK (NIPZK) for NP relations computable in NC1 with proof size |w|·poly(κ) where |w| is the witness length based on the DLIN assumption. This is the first pairing-based NIPZK for a non-trivial class of NP languages whose proof size is independent of |C| based on a standard assumption. (2) We construct a universally composable (UC) NIZK for NP relations computable in NC1 in the erasure-free adaptive setting whose proof size is |w|·poly(κ) from the DLIN assumption. This is an improvement over the recent result of Katsumata, Nishimaki, Yamada, and Yamakawa (CRYPTO’19), which gave a similar result based on a non-static q-type assumption. The main building block for all of our NIZKs is a constrained signature scheme with decomposable online-offline efficiency.

However, malicious attackers can challenge the privacy and security systems of the IoV by conducting security attacks. Currently, many schemes use bilinear pairing or elliptic curves to construct authentication systems, ensuring anonymity of vehicle identities and message security. However, these schemes suffer drawbacks such as low computational efficiency and high communication overhead in highly dynamic IoV. Therefore, we propose a new efficient certificateless message authentication scheme. The proposed scheme constructs a lightweight security authentication protocol by improving the RSA dynamic accumulator and combining it with non-interactive discrete logarithm zero-knowledge proofs. In addition, our scheme eliminates the need for bilinear pairing operations, thereby reducing computational overhead. Simultaneously, it enables real-time tracking and revocation of malicious vehicle identities. Security analysis shows that our scheme can be reduced to a secure S-RSA assumption under the random oracle model, meeting various security requirements of the IoV. Performance analysis shows that our scheme diminishes not only the computational overhead but also the communication overhead. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

To balance the security and usability, the thumbnail preserving encryption (TPE) has emerged. However, existing JPEG image-based TPE (JPEG-TPE) schemes face challenges in achieving low file extension, lossless decryption, and better privacy protect of detailed information. To solve these challenges, we propose a novel JPEG-TPE scheme. First, to achieve a smaller file size expansion and preserve the thumbnail, we reallocate the values, maintaining the sum for the DC difference instead of the DC coefficient. To ensure that the coefficients do not overflow, the valid range of reallocated difference is constrained not only by the sum but also by the neighborhood difference. Second, to preserve the file size of AC encryption while improving the security of detailed information, the AC coefficient groups with undivided RSV are permuted adaptively. Besides, the intra-TPE block swapping of DC difference, quantization table modification, nonzero AC coefficients mapping, and block permutation are used to further encrypt the image. The experimental results show that the proposed JPEG-TPE scheme achieves lossless decryption, reducing the file size expansion of encrypted images from 15.41% to 0.64% compared to the state-of-the-art scheme. Additionally, it is observed that the proposed method can effectively resist against various attacks, including the deep-learning-based super-resolution attack. © 2014 IEEE."

Ball screw drives (BSDs), crucial in CNC machining, require regular upkeep, often challenged by environmental influences and the limitations of wired sensor-based diagnostic procedures. Wireless sensors offer a cost-effective solution but struggle with data integrity during transmission, impacting remote wear evaluation of BSDs. Current recovery methods are not always adequate, often relying on extensive historical data and suffering from accumulating errors. Addressing these limitations, a novel self-supervised transfer learning (SSTL) model is proposed for remote wear assessment of machine tool components. This model integrates an image capture module into CNC surveillance systems and employs a LocalMIM module, which is pretrained and fine-tuned to adapt to various domains, especially for image quality deterioration during data transmission. The SSTL model is designed to function effectively despite significant pixel data loss, eliminating the need for historical data for image restoration.

Nevertheless, some encryption systems suffer from weak key space and inadequate key randomness due to a narrow chaotic parameter range and small Lyapunov exponents. Additionally, we must address the crucial issue of keys lacking or weakly relating to plaintext, as this can hinder the algorithm’s ability to effectively defend against differential attacks. This paper proposes a hybrid one-dimensional and two-dimensional cross-feedback hyperchaotic system framework to enhance key security. We combine the system with a diffusive DNA coding operation to enhance the statistical relationship between plaintext and ciphertext. Firstly, our method associates the current pixel of plaintext images with hyperchaotic sequences to determine the DNA encoding rule for the next pixel. Secondly, we transform ordinary images into DNA matrices through DNA-coding operations with diffusivity. Thirdly, we rearrange the hyperchaotic sequence to change the position of the corresponding DNA matrix elements during scrambled diffusion. Finally, we XOR it with the DNA-encoded hyperchaotic sequence to generate the ciphertext image. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our proposed algorithm has significantly improved in terms of information entropy, correlation, histogram, and other analytical parameters. Additionally, the algorithm exhibits a notably robust resistance to differential attacks. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024."

Conventional anti-ransomware tools often fail to detect zero-day ransomware attacks due to the inability to obtain zero-day ransomware signatures in advance to train detection models. In addition, zero-day ransomware attacks often use sophisticated encryption techniques to launch attacks on new vulnerabilities, and these encryption attacks cause irreversible damage to victims' digital files even if they choose to pay a ransom. Hence, it is imperative and urgent to detect unknown ransomware attacks at the earliest possible stage, ideally before the encryption phase. To this end, this paper proposes Zero-Ran Sniff (ZRS), an early zero-day ransomware detection method based on zero-shot learning, which can detect zero-day ransomware attacks in the early stage. ZRS leverages the portable executable header (PE header) feature from executable files to identify ransomware. It comprises two stages: an auto-encoding network-based core attribute learning (AE-CAL) stage and a self-attentive mechanism-based convolutional neural network inference Stage (SA-CNN-IS). During the AE-CAL stage, the core features of known and unknown classes of ransomware are extracted using self-encoding networks, and the SA-CNN-IS phase identifies ransomware. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the use of zero-shot learning for zero-day ransomware early detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ZRS outperforms traditional machine learning methods. Compared to previous zero-day detection work, ZRS achieves a recall of 98.47% and an accuracy of 96.31% © 2024 The Author(s)"

Attackers continually search for vulnerabilities from software, firmware, and all the way down to hardware level. At the same time, cybersecurity has also been pushed to the hardware platform to keep invaders out. In this article, the main objective is to provide a cost effective solution to FPGA configuration bitstream confidentiality/authentication. A lightweight hardware assisted chaos-based stream cipher for FPGA bitstream protection is proposed and integrated into a system-level security architecture. This enhances cyber resilience at the platform level and strengthens the platform's ability to prevent attacks. The design targets hardware environments, where gate count and power consumption are limited. The proposed security approach is integrated into the FPGA system's boot process to assure a secure booting process, secure key management, and secure remote updating. As chaotic dynamics can be controlled by a low power signal, and require fewer resources to implement the cipher, lower power consumption and hardware utilization are expected. A physical unclonable function (PUF) is applied to provide secrecy to the proposed security approach, making key management feasible for remotely placed devices. A protocol for remote system updating is also proposed. Performance and security analysis show that the proposed approach can be used for securing FPGA-based edge devices. © 2014 IEEE."

In most of the studies, which image frames of the videos are selected to be used in the detection models is determined randomly. This randomness can cause important image frames to be missed which can improve detection performance. The proposed method differs from other studies in the literature by determining which image frames to select from the videos with the help of the golden ratio information on the face.

Secondly, the generated measurement matrix and bidirectional XOR diffusion are applied to the sparse image obtained by sparse processing of plain image to obtain the secret image with low pixel correlation. Subsequently, the secret image is embedded into a non-sensitive carrier image using image steganography, creating a cipher image that provides dual protection for both the content and visual aspects of sensitive image. Finally, employing secret image sharing, the cipher image is partitioned into N shadow images which are transmitted to recipients through public channel, and the image can be reconstructed successfully only when the recipients have at least r (r ≪ N)shadow images.The experimental results indicate that the proposed encryption scheme guarantees the secure recovery of sensitive image while resisting various common attacks, and exhibits strong visual security and compression performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024."

However, ensuring sufficient randomness when extracting binary bits from hardware devices is of utmost importance. The state-of-the-art techniques in the field lack comprehensive exploration for enhancing the quality of randomness in hardware-based TRNGs. This article proposes two techniques to enhance the quality of randomness in TRNGs by leveraging the advantages of voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). The first technique involves postprocessing using von Neumann extraction (VNE) followed by rotation symmetric Boolean functions (RSBFs). The VCMA-MTJ serves as a source of randomness, offering benefits like low energy consumption, high throughput, and a compact design. A 5-variable RSBF is proposed that is invariant under circular translation with very good cryptographic properties. The combination of the proposed RSBF and VNE applied to raw data extracted from the VCMA-MTJ-based TRNG significantly enhances the quality of randomness in the binary stream. Additionally, the sampling point optimization technique effectively showcases true randomness by harnessing device stochasticity and process variations without requiring additional circuitry.

In response to this issue, this paper proposes a novel asymmetric chaotic image encryption scheme combining elliptic curve cryptography (ACIES-ECC). In this scheme, the system key is derived from two parts, which are the original image and the shared key obtained through the Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) algorithm. As the shared key is generated locally, there is no risk of interception during transmission. Additionally, the scheme employs the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to sign the ciphertext, thereby preventing malicious tampering with the ciphertext. Secondly, a new two-dimensional sine-power coupling map (2D-SPCM) is proposed in this paper, which exhibits superior chaotic characteristics and randomness compared to some existing chaotic systems. Furthermore, based on the 2D-SPCM, a cross-plane color image encryption algorithm (CPCIE-SPCM) is designed, which employs the ZigZag rule to globally diffuse the image pixels, and then conducts cross disruption in the various planes. To verify their performance, we further implement the CPCIE-SPCM in the ACIES-ECC. The experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme exhibits favorable encryption performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024."

When organized into neural networks, these neurons can exhibit complex dynamic behaviors, such as multi-scroll and hyperchaotic attractors. In this study, we investigated the dynamic behavior of memristor synapses between four small neurons and proposed a new segmented linear memristor. Based on this, an improved version of the second memristor was obtained by modification. Subsequently, a new neural network was constructed, and the coefficients of the neural network were slightly adjusted. Two memristor synapse HNNs were constructed separately. Finally, these memristors were integrated as synapses and autapses to create the third memristive synapse HNN. It is worth noting that the last memristive HNN can generate hyperchaotic multi-scroll attractors, and its memristor function effectively controls the number of scroll axes. The dynamics of the hyperchaotic multi-scroll memristive HNN were analyzed using phase diagrams, bifurcation diagrams, Poincare maps, and Lyapunov exponent plots. In terms of hardware implementation, we used FPGA to implement the proposed hyperchaotic multi-scroll model and demonstrated 6 memristive HNN attractors on an oscilloscope to validate the accuracy of the model.

In this research, we propose a novel hybrid approach for image encryption that combines the strength of chaotic maps and the optimization power of Genetic Algorithm (GA). The proposed method aims to enhance encryption security, complexity, and robustness to various attacks. The encryption process begins with the application of a chaotic map, specifically the Sine fusion chaos, to scramble the positions of image pixels. This chaotic map introduces chaos and non-linearity, rendering the image data indiscernible. In the subsequent step, AES and Genetic Algorithm is introduced to encrypt the image. The GA dynamically evolves the encryption process, aiming to find an optimal cipher image that maximizes encryption security and minimizes the possibility of unauthorized decryption. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach outperforms traditional image encryption methods in terms of resistance to attacks, robustness, and visual obfuscation. This suggested work demonstrated the algorithm’s resilience to statistical attacks by achieving a maximum entropy of 7.99 and almost zero correlation, despite numerous analyses being conducted on the algorithm. The security analysis reveals the strength of our scheme against various cryptographic attacks.

This paper presents innovative quantum protocols with quantum communication designed to address the FL problem, strengthen privacy measures, and optimize communication efficiency. In contrast to previous works that leverage expressive variational quantum circuits or differential privacy techniques, we consider gradient information concealment using quantum states and propose two distinct FL protocols, one based on private inner-product estimation and the other on incremental learning.

The entire encryption process is governed by the pseudo-random sequences obtained by the 4D chaotic system and the Logistic map. During the digital channel encryption, the confusion and diffusion of the plaintext image are achieved by random scrambling and DNA computing, respectively. To alleviate the burden of key transmission and storage in the CGI encryption system, the speckle measurement matrices are constructed with the pseudo-random numbers obtained by the Logistic map. Additionally, a nonlinear encryption operation is carried out to compensate the linear vulnerability of CGI encryption. In the optical encryption channel, the authentication image is first encrypted with the CGI method, followed by the secondary encryption of the intensity values recorded by a bucket detector to produce an intermediate ciphertext. The final encryption image is generated by merging the intermediate ciphertexts from both encryption channels. It is demonstrated that the proposed optical image encryption and authentication scheme with CGI provides satisfactory encryption and decryption effects and can effectively counteract the common attacks.

This transmission occurs through the utilization of a Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) when remotely diagnosing patients via Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT). However, the transmission of sensitive data from IoMT through WBAN via an insecure channel exposes it to various threats, necessitating the implementation of robust measures to guarantee security against potential adversaries. To address the security concerns associated with patient monitoring in healthcare systems and achieve the necessary security and privacy requirements during communication, a robust authentication framework is indispensable. Hence, it introduces an agile and robust post-quantum authentication framework for cloud-based healthcare applications, effectively mitigating the vulnerabilities identified in the recent literature. This framework is designed to protect against quantum attacks using the Kyber. A formal security verification of the proposed protocol is presented using AVISPA, as well as informally.

This service not only sends out the message to the correct participant but also respects the security of the identity user. In addition, when delivered, all the information must be protected for the party who employs the broadcasting service. Currently, Attribute-Based Broadcast Encryption (ABBE) is useful to apply for the broadcasting service. (ABBE) is a combination of Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) and Broadcast Encryption (BE), which allows a broadcaster (or encrypter) to broadcast an encrypted message, including a predefined user set and specified access policy to install the authorization mechanism. It is desirable to hide all the information when producing in the ciphertext, which has not been considered in the previous works of ABBE. Motivated by the above issue, we devise a solution to achieve anonymity for the ABBE scheme, which not only hides the access structures but also anonymizes the user’s identity. In this work, we propose two schemes as Anonymous Key Policy (AKP)-ABBE and Anonymous Ciphertext Policy (ACP)-ABBE with supporting multiple access structures by using OR/AND gates. Specifically, we present the generic constructions of AKP/ACP-ABBE on the building block of the Inner Product Encryption (IPE), which enables the hidden user’s identity and complex OR/AND-Gate access structure.

The explosion in data volume requires higher standards of image compression and encryption technology. This paper proposes a lossless and lossy encryption-compression method for RSI. Because RSIs contain important and unimportant information, using a normal algorithm could ignore their important information or reduce the computational efficiency, so we use the trained model by DeepLabv3+ to segment the region of interest (ROI) and the region of non-interest (RONI), and implement lossless and lossy algorithms respectively. The whole algorithm is based on the newly proposed hyperchaotic system 2D Tent coupled Infinite collapse map (2D TICM). According to the 2D TICM, the dynamic 3D Latin cube is generated. This cube is then used for dynamic scrambling algorithms between multiple planes (3D LMBS), within planes (3D LMIS), and for the multiple dynamic S boxes substitution algorithm. Due to the large size of RSI, the image is divided into blocks, and MATLAB parallel mechanism is used to encrypt each block at the same time. First, the lossy part is scrambled by 3D LMIS, then compressed with 2D compressive sensing (2D CS). Finally, each block is substituted with a different S box. A CS reconstruction algorithm combining decryption and reconstruction, 2D projection gradient chaotic decryption algorithm (2D PG-CD), is proposed. The lossless part embeds the encryption into JPEG-LS, encrypts while compressing, and then encrypts according to 3D LMBS and S boxes. The algorithm in this paper considers the characteristics of RSI, experiments show that it has good security and compression performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

In order to prevent privacy leakage for the business participants, it is essential to construct a credible transaction environment. For this purpose, we construct a strict cryptographic scheme based on consortium blockchain that addresses two key perspectives. Firstly, an identity-based homomorphic scheme is proposed, so that the encapsulated transaction result can be correctly calculated and verified for the flowing amount. Secondly, the supervised function is incorporated to the homomorphic scheme. One more public key is added into the encryption trapdoor, and this key is assigned to the supervisor. Consequently, both the airline and the supervisor who work as the two recipients can independently decrypt the ciphertext without time-consuming interaction. Experimental results show that the system achieves encryption time of 15 ms, and decryption time is 15 ms and 15.45 ms for both recipients. Compared to the popular cryptocurrency schemes, the system significantly achieves the supervised function without compromising efficiency. Finally, the application network architecture is put forward for the supervised privacy preservation transaction system. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

It is proven that the molecular weight (MW) of such luminescent polymers has a significant impact on their emission over a large range, generally with a red shift as the MW increases. Herein, four controllable MW polyacrylamides are prepared via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT), and their photoluminescence quantum yield and p-RTP lifetimes gradually increase with the increasing MW. The emission of p-RTP gradually shifts blue with increasing MW, which is likely due to the gradually changing interactions between the electron-rich portion in RAFT reagent and the increasing acrylamide (AM) units in the molecular chain. These can be reasonably explained through small angle X-ray scattering, the clustering-triggered emission (CTE) mechanism, and supported by theoretical calculations. Powder with controllable p-RTP capability has the potential for strategic anti-counterfeiting encryption. The above results not only promote the development of the CTE mechanism toward more precise explanations but also provide new ideas for the preparation of nonconventional luminescent polymers with controllable p-RTP emission performance. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

With the recent rapid development of quantum cryptography, quantum-proof randomness extraction has also been widely studied, addressing the security issues in the presence of a quantum adversary. In contrast with conventional quantum-proof randomness extractors characterizing the input raw data as min-entropy sources, it is found that the input raw data generated by a large class of trusted-device quantum random number generators can be characterized as the so-called reverse block source. This fact enables us to design improved extractors. Two novel quantum-proof randomness extractors for reverse block sources that realize real-time block-wise extraction are proposed specifically. In comparison with the general min-entropy randomness extractors, the designs achieve a significantly higher extraction speed and a longer output data length with the same seed length. In addition, they enjoy the property of online algorithms, which process the raw data on the fly without waiting for the entire input raw data to be available. These features make the design an adequate choice for the real-time post-processing of practical quantum random number generators. Applying the extractors to the raw data generated by a widely used quantum random number generator, a simulated extraction speed as high as 300 Gbps is achieved. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

However, these systems are facing a growing susceptibility to a wide range of emerging attacks. Cyber-attacks against CPS have the potential to cause disruptions in the accurate sensing and actuation processes, resulting in significant harm to physical entities and posing concerns for the overall safety of society. Unlike common security measures like firewalls and encryption, which often aren't enough to deal with the unique problems that CPS architectures present, deploying machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) that are specifically made for CPS has become an important way to make them safer. The application of machine learning algorithms has been suggested as a means of mitigating cyber-attacks on CPS. However, the limited availability of labelled data pertaining to emerging attack techniques poses a significant challenge to the accurate detection of such attacks. In the given scenario, transfer learning emerges as a promising methodology for the detection of cyber-attacks, as it involves the implicit modelling of the system. In this research, we propose a new lightweight transfer learning method via ResNet50-CNN1D for intrusion detection in CPS. The Adaptive Gradient (Adagrad) optimizer was applied in the proposed model to minimize the loss function through the adjustment of network weight. We tested how well the suggested ResNet50-1D-CNN model worked using the UNSW-NB15 dataset and a control system dataset called HAI. The HAI dataset was taken from the testbed and based on a planned physical attack scenario. By calculating the coefficient scores for the top ten (10) features in the HAI and UNSW-NB15 data, it was possible to determine the relevance of a feature. The rationale behind employing transfer learning was to mitigate the complexity associated with the classification of cyber-attacks and runtime. The utilization of transfer learning resulted in notable reductions in both the training and testing times required for the detection of attacks. On the HAI data, the results showed an accuracy of 97.32 %, recall of 98.41 %, F1-score of 96.32 %, and precision of 97.09 %.

However, traditional encryption methods such as Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) or Data Encryption Standard (DES) are not suitable for IoT environments where large amounts of data need to be quickly encrypted. In this paper, a multi-precision encryption mechanism based on multi-dimensional chaotic system is proposed. Firstly, the proposed scheme uses floating-point, 32-bit, 24-bit, and 16-bit data accuracy respectively, which can effectively reduce the complexity through fixed-point calculation. Secondly, aiming at the problem that traditional chaotic dynamic analysis methods such as the Lyapunov index cannot be applied, an analysis scheme based on complexity measure is proposed. Finally, a free dimension encryption mechanism based on Logistic, Tent, and PWLCM is proposed. By adding random disturbance to a one-dimensional chaotic map, the weak randomness of the single chaotic sequence is overcome effectively. Finally, the security analysis of the encryption scheme is carried out, and the result proves that the scheme can effectively resist the common attack means. In the 3D chaotic system, the encryption effect of 24-bit data accuracy is close to floating point accuracy, which is suitable for the IoT environment with large data volume, high encryption efficiency, and vulnerability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Data hiding and encryption are important tools for this goal. This paper proposes a data-hiding method for medical images in the context of invisibility, robustness, security and low time cost. A dual watermarking is introduced to accomplish chaos-based encryption to ensure medical images' copyright protection and content security. First, a local binary pattern based on neighbouring pixels is used to compute an optimal value, called an embedding factor, for embedding both marks. Second, the host medical image is marked using the lifting wavelet transform, the lower–upper (LU) decomposition and singular value decomposition with an embedding factor to protect ownership. Last, the marked image is encrypted by using a 3D-chaotic map. The method is tested on two standard datasets, which is convenient for medical applications. Our experimental results and performance analysis demonstrate that the proposed scheme produces a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and NCwat1/NCwat2 of 54.82 dB and 0.9916/0.9928, respectively. Furthermore, the key space analysis of our encryption technique is greater than 2100, which provides a high protection degree against brute-force attacks. The proposed scheme achieves better robustness, imperceptibility, and security performance than previous schemes. Our method can reduce time costs by 98% (91% on average), which results in lower time costs than other conventional encryption techniques. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Here we introduce ethidium bromide, as a functional precursor with red emission, to enhance the red emission for Cdots, with comparable intensity at a broad wavelength range to multi-emission Cdots (M-Cdots). We found that Cdots prepared with ethidium bromide/ethylenediamine exhibited strong blue and red emission at 440 and 615 nm, with optimal excitation at 360 and 470 nm as M-Cdots, respectively, but the Cdots from single ethidium bromide (EB-Cdots) possessed weak red emission. M-Cdots exhibited a broad absorption band at 478 nm, but a band blue-shifted to 425 nm was observed for EB-Cdots, while no absorption was observed at 478–425 nm for the Cdots prepared with citric acid and ethylenediamine. Thus, we proposed that C=O and C=N formed a π-conjugation structure as the absorption band at 478 nm for the red emission of M-Cdots, as also confirmed with the excitation at 470 nm. Moreover, the π-conjugation structure is fragile and sensitive to harsh conditions, so red emission was difficult to observe for the Cdots prepared with citric acid/ethylenediamine or single ethidium bromide. M-Cdots possess two centers for blue and red emission with different structures. The dual emission was therefore used for ratiometric sensing with dichromate (Cr2O72−) and formaldehyde (HCHO) as the targets using the intensity ratio of the emissions at 615 and 440 nm. Due to the comparable intensity at a broad wavelength range, we designed encryption codes with five excitations at 360, 400, 420, 450, and 470 nm as the inputs, and the emission colors were used for information decoding. Thus, we determined why red emission was difficult to realize for Cdots, and our results could motivate the design of red-emission Cdots for extensive applications.

Identity-Based Authenticated Encryption with Keyword Search (IBAEKS) is a PAEKS variant in identity-based settings, designed for solving the intractable certificate management problem. To the best of our knowledge, only two IBAEKS schemes exist in the literature, both presented with weak security models that make them vulnerable against what is known as Fully Chosen Keyword attacks. Moreover, the existing IBAEKS schemes are based on the time-consuming bilinear pairing operation, leading to a significant increase in computational cost. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we first propose an enhanced security model for IBAEKS and compare it with existing models.

Secure—blind and verifiable—delegated quantum computing (SDQC) has emerged as one of the key approaches to address this challenge, yet current protocols lack at least one of the following three ingredients: composability, noise-robustness and modularity. To tackle this question, our paper lays out the fundamental structure of SDQC protocols, namely mixing two components: the computation which the client would like the server to perform and tests that are designed to detect a server’s malicious behaviour. Using this abstraction, our main technical result is a set of sufficient conditions on these components which imply the security and noise-robustness of generic SDQC protocols in the composable Abstract Cryptography framework. This is done by establishing a correspondence between these security properties and the error-detection capabilities of the test computations. Changing the types of tests and how they are mixed with the client’s computation automatically yields new SDQC protocols with different security and noise-robustness capabilities. This approach thereby provides the desired modularity as our sufficient conditions on test computations simplify the steps required to prove the security of the protocols and allows to focus on the design and optimisation of test rounds to specific situations. We showcase this by systematising the search for improved SDQC protocols for bounded-error quantum polynomial-time ( BQP ) computations.

There are potential shortcomings of existing approaches that could be addressed or improved. These limitations are limited Robustness, insufficient security measures, Complexity and Efficiency Trade-offs and limited imperceptibility. In the proposed approach, I be able to verify the reliability of the original image based on the extracted watermark information. In case of any modification, I can retrieve and regain the host image from the obtained extracted watermark information. The focal contribution of the paper is to obtain a secure approach with high imperceptibility of the watermark, high robustness of the extracted watermark and less complexity approach. I apply OTP encryption to the watermarked image to increase the security concept of the approach. My proposed watermarking method introduces several notable advancements over existing algorithms. Firstly, it combines an informed and recovery watermarking approach, allowing for the embedding of imperceptible data in multimedia content while enabling the retrieval of the original. Additionally, my method incorporates OTP encryption to bolster security measures, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the embedded watermark. Furthermore, by leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and coefficient insertion techniques, I achieve high imperceptibility and robustness of the watermark while minimizing computational complexity. Tested against various attacks, my approach demonstrates superior performance with a PSNR of approximately 42 dB and a BER of 0.0012. Overall, the method fills a critical gap in watermarking technology by providing a secure, robust, and imperceptible solution for multimedia content protection. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

By allowing the secure and immutable storage of medical files and healthcare-related transactions, BC ensured that sensitive medical data remains tamper-proof and open only to authorized parties. Patients have greater control over their data's development, revoking or granting access as required, but healthcare workers can streamline data sharing and ensure the integrity of important data. The decentralized nature of BC networks decreases the risk of centralized data breaches, eventually fostering trust and transparency in the healthcare ecosystems. Conversely, deep learning (DL) has great to revolutionize healthcare diagnostics in the future, offering quick and extremely accurate estimates of medical conditions. This technology has greatly enhanced patient solutions, decreased medical expenses, and improved the burden on medical staff by providing appreciated insights into an extensive range of conditions, from cancer to neurological disorders. With this stimulus, this study presents a novel BC with optimal DL-based secure data sharing and classification (BCODL-SDSC) technique in the future healthcare system. The goal of the BCODL-SDSC technique is to secure and thoroughly examine healthcare data using BC and DL techniques. Primarily, the BCODL-SDSC technique enables BC technology to store and maintain the patient's data from the procedure of several transactions and enable access control to the various stakeholders. For the security of the medical images, the BCODL-SDSC technique applies the Fractional Order Lorenz system (FOLS) based encryption technique with tuna swarm optimization (TSO) algorithm based optimal key generation process. Finally, a multi-stage process performs the classification of the medical images: MobileNetv1 feature extractor, artificial rabbit's optimization (ARO) based hyperparameter tuning, and stacked recurrent neural network (SRNN) based classification. The experimental outcome of the BCODL-SDSC technique was examined on a benchmark medical image database.

The scheme encrypts and stores massive dating data on the cloud server (CS), and uploading the corresponding keyword index to the nearby edge node (EN) for distributed storage. To enhance the search experience for users, this paper uses the Bisecting K-means clustering algorithm to classify all dating documents, categorizes the keywords with high relevance to form keyword grouping first, and then constructs the inverted index based on the keyword grouping results, so that we can quickly locate the position of the query keywords, and then find the matching document identifiers to speed up the ciphertext search. Simultaneously, this paper introduces the BM25 model to calculate the relevance scores of ciphertext documents to achieve the effect of ranking ciphertext documents. Under the general bilinear group model, the proposed scheme proves selectively secure against selective keyword attacks and plain text attacks.

SIMON is a lightweight block cipher proposed by the National Security Agency (NSA) of US to provide efficient and secure encryption for resource-constrained devices in IoT systems. This article aims to evaluate the security of SIMON against mixture differential cryptanalysis, which was proposed in Eurocrypt 2017 to launch the best key-recovery attacks on the most widely used encryption standard AES. Though there have been intensive studies on this cryptanalysis method, its current targets are all aligned block ciphers. Whether the numerous bitwise block ciphers, including SIMON, have weaknesses regarding this method remains unknown. In this article, we extend the mixture differential cryptanalysis to bitwise ciphers and develop an SAT-based automatic tool to search for such distinguishers. We interpret the bitwise mixture differential distinguisher as a variant of differential distinguisher in the multikey setting with 2-3n as the boundary (n: block size), potentially boosting rounds or improving the signal-to-noise ratio of previous boomerang or classical differential distinguisher. Using SIMON as an example, we discover multikey distinguishers for up to 17-round SIMON32, 18-round SIMON48, and 23-round SIMON64, which outperform previous results in terms of the number of rounds. This article reconciles the disparity between mixture differential cryptanalysis applied to word-oriented target ciphers and its application to bit-oriented targets, thereby extending the mixture differential cryptanalysis to a broader range of block ciphers. © 2014 IEEE."

The intricate anatomical structure and synaptic plasticity engender high adaptability to external stimuli and rich diversity of firing modes. This paper introduces a novel coupled functional neuron model and investigates its application in medical image encryption. Firstly, the thermistor and photocell are embedded in the nonlinear circuit to construct the thermosensitive model and the photosensitive neuron model. Then a new photo-thermal coupled neuron model is formulated by activating the linear resistor connection. Bifurcation analysis and complexity adjustment confirm the intricate dynamic behavior of the coupled neuron model. Next, an innovative ISI-encoded algorithm is created by capturing the interspike interval sequences of the model. Complexity comparison results exhibit that the ISI-encoded chaotic sequences are more stochastic and feasible compared to the original ones. Additionally, a novel medical image encryption scheme is developed by utilizing the constructed ISI-encoded chaotic sequence. The approach comprises of three stages: component disruption, row and column cyclic permutation, and an inventive diffusion based on Coulomb’s law. The scheme is tested on diverse medical images. Finally, the experimental performance and security analysis validate the efficiency of the designed encryption scheme and its promising robustness against numerous conceivable attacks.

This constraint dictates that any group of up to X colluding servers must not disclose any information about the stored messages. Furthermore, any group of up to T servers is restricted from learning anything about the coefficients of the linear combination retrieved by the user. In this work, we completely characterize the asymptotic capacity of GXSTPLC, i.e., the supremum of achievable rates (which is the average number of desired symbols retrieved per downloaded symbol), in the limit as the number of messages K approaches infinity. Specifically, it is shown that a prior linear programming based upper bound on the asymptotic capacity of GXSTPLC due to Jia and Jafar is tight (thus settles their conjecture) by constructing achievability schemes. Notably, our achievability scheme also settles the exact capacity (i.e., for finite K) of X-secure linear combination with graph based replicated storage (GXSLC). Our achievability proof builds upon an achievability scheme for a closely related problem named asymmetric X-secure T-private linear computation with graph based replicated storage (Asymm-GXSTPLC) that guarantees non-uniform security and privacy levels across messages and coefficients (of the desired linear combination). In particular, by carefully designing Asymm-GXSTPLC settings for GXSTPLC problems, the corresponding Asymm-GXSTPLC schemes can be reduced to asymptotic capacity achieving schemes for GXSTPLC. In regard to the achievability scheme for Asymm-GXSTPLC, interesting aspects of our construction include a novel query and answer design which makes use of a Vandermonde decomposition of Cauchy matrices, and a trade-off among message replication, security and privacy thresholds. © 2024 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

This paper delves into the challenge of modulating HNN dynamics through time-variant stimuli. The effects of adjustments using two distinct types of time-variant stimuli, namely the Weight Matrix Stimulus (WMS) and the State Variable Stimulus (SVS), along with a Constant Stimulus (CS) are reported. The findings reveal that deploying four WMSs enables the HNN to generate either a four-scroll or a coexisting two-scroll attractor. When combined with one SVS, four WMSs can lead to the formation of an eight-scroll or four-scroll attractor, while the integration of four WMSs and multiple SVSs can induce grid-multi-scroll attractors. Moreover, the introduction of a CS and an SVS can significantly disrupt the dynamic behavior of the HNN. Consequently, suitable adjustment methods are crucial for enhancing the network's dynamics, whereas inappropriate applications can lead to the loss of its chaotic characteristics. To empirically validate these enhancement effects, the study employs an FPGA hardware platform. Subsequently, an image encryption scheme is designed to demonstrate the practical application benefits of the dynamically adjusted HNN in secure multimedia communication. This exploration into the dynamic modulation of HNN via time-variant stimuli offers insightful contributions to the advancement of secure communication technologies.  © 2004-2012 IEEE."

However, despite significant progress, the realization of the full potential of UAV-based applications is hindered by inherent security vulnerabilities, including the susceptibility of communication between drones and base stations to intrusion. This research addresses critical research gaps by proposing a novel authentication method that leverages Shamir's secret sharing. Unlike existing authentication protocols, which often rely on Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) that assume resistance to noise and theoretical ideals, our approach acknowledges the potential errors in PUF responses. This accommodation allows for the successful authentication of legitimate UAVs, even in the presence of external environmental factors introducing noise in PUFs. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, extensive simulations were conducted using NodeMCU and Raspberry Pi devices. We show that our approach outclasses other existing methods across multiple dimensions with communication cost of mere 450 mu s on NodeMCU. Additionally, it incurs lower communication costs (1600 bits) and storage costs (352 bits), showcasing superior efficiency. Moreover, it maintains robust security and scalability while consuming reasonable energy levels, making it a comprehensive solution for UAV-based applications.  © 2013 IEEE."

In this work, an experimental scheme is presented for PNS attack employing demonstrated technological capabilities, specifically a single-photon Raman interaction (SPRINT) in a cavity-enhanced three-level atomic system. Several aspects of the proposed implementation are addressed, analytically and simulatively, and the eavesdropper's information gain by the attack is calculated. Furthermore, it is analytically shown that the scheme results in a small (yet non-zero) quantum bit error rate, and a comparison to purely theoretical analyses in the literature is presented.

Semiquantum key distribution (SQKD), which allows a quantum user to share a confidential key with a classical user who prepares and operates qubits on only one basis, is an important example for studying this issue. To further limit the quantum resources used by users, in this paper, the first SQKD protocol is constructed, which restricts the quantum user to prepare quantum states on only one basis and removes the classical user's measurement capability. Furthermore, it is proven that the constructed protocol is secure against the restricted attack by deriving a key rate expression of the error rate in the asymptotic scenario.

In this study, we synthesized Cs2Ag0.3-xNaxZn0.35In1-yCl6:yM (M = Cr/Bi) series LHDPs using an anti-solvent assisted co-precipitation method, improving the optical properties of Cs2AgInCl6-based materials by optimizing their composition.

It is anticipated to enhance the quality and efficiency of medical services, thus enhancing people's overall quality of life. However, frequently occurring medical data leakage makes the protection of medical data and privacy in IoMT become a critical issue. Among the solutions, attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been a very promising solution due to its flexible and fine-grained access control to encrypted data. However, the majority of current ABE schemes are based on bilinear pairing and are vulnerable to quantum attacks. The available of multi-authority ABE schemes over lattice only support a single policy such as threshold or AND gate, and lack the ability to implement user or attribute revocation in a flexible manner. For the special algebra structure of the lattice based scheme, how to overcome them is still a challenge at present. Aiming at the above, we propose a novel multi-authority key-policy attribute based encryption (RM-KP-ABE) based on the Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE) assumption. It supports multi-valued attributes and {0,1}-LSSS access policy. This scheme allows multiple authorities to participate in key distribution and enables attribute revocation when dynamic users change their situation. {0,1}-LSSS access policy makes the proposal get highly expressive which supports any monotonic boolean formula.

By adopting this paradigm, we obviate slow cryptographic premises such as identity-based encryption (IBE) that were used in prior work. Furthermore, we enhance the existing verifiable credentials (VCs) from this paradigm by introducing our own decentralized permission objects to support the concept of transitive delegations. This concept allows delegates to further delegate their access to resources with the same or fewer privileges to other entities within the framework. This renders our solution suitable for diverse scenarios, including applications in decentralized building access management. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the concept of transitive delegations in this paradigm.

Therefore, in this paper, based on the traditional model of ciphertext speech retrieval system, an efficient encrypted speech retrieval based on Hadoop cluster under SW CPU is proposed. The study uses the SW CPU as a cloud and introduces the Hadoop cluster technology. In the proposed algorithm, firstly, the peak frequency and spectral crest factor of the speech are extracted and fused. Secondly, the hyper chaotic measurement matrix is generated by the key so that it is iterated with the feature vectors and further binarized to generate the BioHashing sequence. A pseudo-random sequence is generated by the key, mapping encryption is performed on the speech segments to generate the encrypted speech, and linear-feedback shift register (LSFR) encryption is performed on the BioHashing sequence to generate the hash index. Finally, the hash index and encrypted speech are uploaded to the cloud via WinSCP. In the SW CPU, multi-processor simultaneous operation can speed up the processing of large amounts of data. The experimental results show that the proposed BioHashing algorithm has a good compromise relationship and the proposed system model has a good security.

The performance of non-adaptive displacement receiver and multi-stage feedforward receiver are both investigated under different noises and device imperfections. To improve the receiver performance, we numerically optimize the displacement operation and check the quantum advantage of the displacement receivers over the classical homodyne detection. Then we analyze the security of the proposed CV-QKD protocol. The secret key rate is derived for both types of displacement receivers under the collective beam splitting attack. We also optimize the transmitted signal photons for different channel transmission efficiencies under practical system constraints. Numerical results shed light on the practical application of displacement receivers in CV-QKD protocols. This includes evaluating the necessity of optimizing the displacement and incorporating the feedforward structure in a displacement receiver according to different practical system limitations.

Information security in such resource-constrained devices is ensured using lightweight ciphers, where combinational circuit implementations of SBox are preferable over look-up tables as they are more efficient regarding area, power, and memory requirements. Most existing fault analysis techniques focus on fault injection in memory cells and registers. Recently, a novel fault model and analysis technique, namely Semi-Permanent Stuck-At (SPSA) fault analysis, has been proposed to evaluate the security of ciphers with combinational circuit implementation of Substitution layer elements, SBox. In this work, we propose optimized techniques to recover the key in a minimum number of ciphertexts in such implementations of lightweight ciphers. Based on the proposed techniques, a key recovery attack on the NIST lightweight cryptography (NIST-LWC) standardization process finalist, Elephant AEAD, has been proposed. The proposed key recovery attack is validated on two versions of Elephant cipher. The proposed fault analysis approach recovered the secret key within 85-240 ciphertexts, calculated over 1,000 attack instances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on fault analysis attacks on the Elephant scheme. Furthermore, an optimized combinational circuit implementation of Spongent SBox (SBox used in Elephant cipher) is proposed, having a smaller gate count than the optimized implementation reported in the literature. The proposed fault analysis techniques are validated on primary and optimized versions of Spongent SBox through Verilog simulations. Further, we pinpoint SPSA hotspots in the lightweight GIFT cipher SBox architecture. We observe that GIFT SBox exhibits resilience toward the proposed SPSA fault analysis technique under the single fault adversarial model. However, eight SPSA fault patterns reduce the nonlinearity of the SBox to zero, rendering it vulnerable to linear cryptanalysis. Conclusively, SPSA faults may adversely affect the cryptographic properties of an SBox, thereby leading to trivial key recovery. The GIFT cipher is used as an example to focus on two aspects: (i) its SBox construction is resilient to the proposed SPSA analysis and therefore characterizing such constructions for SPSA resilience and (ii) an SBox even though resilient to the proposed SPSA analysis, may exhibit vulnerabilities toward other classical analysis techniques when subjected to SPSA faults.

The experiments, which can be replicated using our open-source code, are conducted on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) dataset. They show that errors introduced by precomputed Layer Normalizaion, approximate FHE operations and polynomial approximations do not produce a significant performance loss. © 2024 Owner/Author."

The algorithm first uses firefly optimization to compute the optimal embedding strength factor, which is useful for maintaining an effective relationship between robustness and quality. The combination of spatial and transformed domain schemes is then adopted to conceal the multiple marks on the different channels of the carrier media through the optimal strength factor. In order to make image marking safer, it is encrypted before being concealed by the media channel. Extensive experiments analyzed the impact of various results on Kodak and USI-SIPI datasets, demonstrating that the suggested algorithm has improved robustness, excellent quality, and high capacity. Superior to other existing schemes, the proposed algorithm achieves robustness of up to 11% with the improved watermark capacity. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.

Though significant research has been devoted to developing secure and efficient Multi-Input Functional Encryption schemes supporting diverse functions, there remains a noticeable research gap in the development of verifiable FE schemes. Functionality and performance have received considerable attention, however, the crucial aspect of verifiability in FE has been relatively understudied. Another important aspect that prior research in FE with outsourced decryption has not adequately addressed is the fairness of the data-for-money exchange between a curator and an analyst. This paper focuses on addressing these gaps by proposing a verifiable FE scheme for inner product computation. The scheme not only supports the multi-client setting but also extends its functionality to accommodate multiple users - an essential feature in modern privacy-respecting services. Additionally, it demonstrates how this FE scheme can be effectively utilized to ensure fairness and atomicity in a payment protocol, further enhancing the trustworthiness of data exchanges. © 2024 Owner/Author."

A fluorescence chemosensor of temperature, white light-emitting anticounterfeiting inks, and different products for security encryption of confidential documents were prepared on the basis of the FRET mechanism due to an efficient spectral overlap between the emission of the coumarin donor and the absorption of the rhodamine B (RhB) acceptor.

The increasing number of vehicles has made the vehicular network diverse, dynamic, and large-scale, making it difficult to meet the 5G network's demanding requirements. Decentralized systems are interesting and provide attractive services because they are publicly available (transparency), have an append-only ledger (robust integrity protection), remove single points of failure, and enable distributed key management and communication in a peer-to-peer network. Researchers dedicated substantial efforts to advancing vehicle communications, however conventional cryptographic mechanisms are insufficient which enabled us to look at decentralized technologies. Therefore, we revisit decentralized approaches with VANETs. Endpoint devices hold a wallet which may incorporate threshold key management methods like MPC wallets, HD Wallets, or multi-party threshold ECDSA/EdDSA/BLS. We also discuss trust management approaches and demonstrate how decentralization can improve integrity, security, privacy, and resilience to single points of failure. We also conduct a comprehensive review, comparing them with current requirements, and the latest authentication and secure communication architectures, which require the involvement of trusted but non-transparent authorities in certificate issuance/revocation.

For example, a common scenario in the edge-computing paradigm is having many nodes requesting authentication from one edge-server. To this end, Group Authentication Schemes (GASs) were introduced recently in the literature. However, most of the proposed GAS are valid for one-time-authentication, lack of flexibility, and key-agreement feature. In this paper, we exploit the advantages of two security primitives, physically unclonable functions (PUFs) and Shamir's secret sharing scheme (SSS) to design a lightweight group authentication scheme (GAS) for edge-computing applications. Specifically, we apply PUFs on SSS and utilize the SSS-homomorphic property to achieve multiple-time group-authentications with the same set of shares. Our PUF-GAS scheme is lightweight, establishes a new group key-agreement per session, and supports efficient node-evicting mechanism. Furthermore, in PUF-GAS, the group nodes do not store any shares; instead, the nodes derive their secret-shares from their PUF-responses. We formally analyze our protocol theoretically and with AVISPA to show that our scheme achieves message secrecy and authenticity. Additionally, we evaluate our scheme in terms of storage, computational complexity, and communication overhead. Specifically, we evaluate the cryptographic operations used in PUF-GAS on an Arduino-Mega, an 8-bit RISC-based ATmega2560 micro-controller. Finally, we present a comparative evaluation of our scheme with others in terms of security and performance.  © 2013 IEEE."

Plausibly deniable encryption (PDE) has been designed to defend against this strong coercive attacker. At its core, PDE allows the victim to plausibly deny the very existence of hidden sensitive data and the corresponding decryption keys upon being coerced. Designing an efficient PDE system for a mobile platform, however, is challenging due to various design constraints bound to the mobile systems. Leveraging image steganography and the built-in hardware security feature of mobile devices, namely TrustZone, we have designed a Simple Mobile Plausibly Deniable Encryption (SMPDE) system which can combat coercive adversaries and, meanwhile, is able to overcome unique design constraints. In our design, the encoding/decoding process of image steganography is bounded together with Arm TrustZone. In this manner, the coercive adversary will be given a decoy key, which can only activate a DUMMY trusted application that will instead sanitize the sensitive information stored hidden in the stego-image upon decoding. On the contrary, the actual user can be given the true key, which can activate the PDE trusted application that can really extract the sensitive information from the stego-image upon decoding. Security analysis and experimental evaluation justify both the security and the efficiency of our design. © 2024 Owner/Author."

Its lightweight circuit design makes it suitable for power-sensitive satellites. However, the SRAM PUF is significantly affected by high-energy particles and cosmic rays in space, which causes incorrect output of identity authentication codes and further leading to a degradation in reliability. Recently, the main research works are concerned about the impact of cosmic rays induced total ionizing dose effects on the SRAM PUF, and few reports discuss the high-energy particles induced single event effects on the SRAM PUF. This paper presents the reliability results of planar and FinFET-based SRAM PUFs after high-energy heavy ion experiments. Experimental results indicate that 3%-10% of the SRAM PUF bits change from their original power-on states, which demonstrate that ion-induced microdose effects degrade the reliability of SRAM PUFs. In addition, the three-dimensional technology computer-aided design simulation tool is used to analyze the physical mechanisms of the experimental phenomena. Simulation results show that the heavy ion-induced microdose effect ionizes and produces trapped charges at the silicon/insulation interface, which causes a slight change in transistor leakage current or a slight drift in threshold voltage. The physical mechanisms lead to an off-state current mismatch in the SRAM cell and finally affect the stored values after power-on. © 2024 Author(s)."

In this work, an experimental demonstration is presented of the broadband generation of FPOVs in the visible spectrum utilizing a monolithic plasmonic metasurface with phase-only modulation. The metasurface allows for flexible control of various parameters of the FPOVs, including their topological charge, beam radius, ellipticity factor, orientation, and the number of opening gaps.

It is vital but challenging to develop organic afterglow materials possessing controlled output with multi-stimuli-responsive capacity. Herein, dimethyl terephthalate (DTT) is introduced as a strong proton acceptor. The migration direction of N─H protons on two compounds Hs can be regulated by altering the excitation wavelength (Ex) or amine stimulation, thereby achieving dual-stimuli-responsive afterglow emission. When the Ex is below 300 nm, protons migrate to S1-2DTT, where strong interactions induce phosphorescent emission of Hs, resulting in afterglow behavior. Conversely, when the Ex is above 300 nm, protons interact with the S0DTT weakly and the afterglow disappears. In view of amine-based compounds with higher proton accepting capabilities, it can snatch proton from S1-2DTT and redirect the proton flow toward amine, effectively suppressing the afterglow but obtaining a new redshifted fluorescence emission with Δλ over 200 nm due to the high polarity of amine. Moreover, it is successfully demonstrated that the applications of dual-stimuli-responsive organic afterglow materials in information encryption based on the systematic excitation-wavelength-dependent (Ex-De) behavior and amine selectivity detection. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

Moreover, it also gives efficient orange-red emission band at 637 nm with PLQY of 97.1% at the 365 nm excitation.

However, with the increasing demand on information security, materials with time-dependent features are urgently required, especially the material where the same information can appear more than once on the time scale. Here, one concise strategy to realize time-dependent anticounterfeiting and “double-lock” information encryption based on a host-guest system is proposed, with one photoresponsive azopolymer as the host and one liquid-crystalline molecule as the guest. The system exhibits a tunable mass transport in pre-designed periodic micro/nanostructures by tailoring the process of cis-to-trans recovery of azo groups and assembly of mesogenic trans-isomers, resulting in a dynamic structural color in film. Taking advantage of this extraordinary feature, time-dependent dynamic anticounterfeiting has been achieved. More importantly, the time of each state's appearance in the whole process can be modulated by changing the host-guest ratio. Combining the manipulatable process of mass transport with the unique decoding method, the stored information in film can be decrypted correctly. This work provides an unprecedented dynamic approach for advanced anticounterfeiting technology with a higher level of security and high-end applications in information encryption. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

To realize this vision, we will discuss the technical requirements and related challenges, including: (1) securing worker profiles in task matching to respect individual privacy, (2) assuring high-quality crowdsourced data to enhance data values, (3) enabling versatile data analytics to uncover data insights, (4) protecting data at the front-end to fully achieve E2EE, and (5) preventing the abuse of E2EE for practical deployment.

Generally, hydrogels with a denser cross-linking density tend to have better mechanical properties, but the improvement in mechanical properties comes at the expense of reduced electrical conductivity. Directly generating CaCO3 in the hydrogel prepolymer can not only increase the cross-linking density of its network but also introduce additional ions to enhance its internal ionic strength, which is beneficial to improving the conductivity of the hydrogel. It is still a big challenge to directly generate CaCO3 in the static prepolymer solution and ensure its uniform dispersion in the hydrogel. Herein, we adopted an improved preparation method to ensure that the directly generated CaCO3 particles can be evenly dispersed in the static prepolymer solution until the polymerization is completed. Finally, a PAM/PVA/CaCO3 hydrogel with supertensile, compressive, toughness, and fatigue resistance properties was prepared. In addition, the presence of free Na+ and Cl- gives the hydrogel excellent conductivity and sensing performance to monitor daily human activities. On the basis of the application of hydrogels in information communication, we have further deepened this application by combining the characteristics of hydrogels themselves. Combined with ASCII code, the hydrogel can also be applied in information exchange and information encryption and decryption, achieving the antitheft function in smart locks. A variety of excellent performance integrated PAM/PVA/CaCO3 hydrogels have broad application prospects for flexible sensors, highlighting great potential in human-computer interaction and intelligent information protection. © 2024 American Chemical Society."

A Hierarchical Key Assignment Scheme (HKAS) is designed to cryptographically enforce access control in hierarchical structures. It operates by assigning secrets and encryption keys to a set of classes within a partially ordered hierarchy. This approach ensures that the secret of a higher-level class can be used to efficiently derive keys for all classes positioned at a lower level in the hierarchy. In this paper, we introduce a novel cryptographic primitive that we name HKAS with Key Rotation (KR-HKAS). This extension enhances the current HKAS framework by enabling a provably secure mechanism for periodically rotating both encryption keys and secrets, without necessitating a complete setup reset. This proactive approach effectively mitigates the risk of security breaches due to compromised cryptographic material, aligning with the best security practice. © 2024 ACM."

We show that by formalizing the gate generation procedure, we can adopt a match-And-replace strategy to significantly improve the evaluation speed of logic circuits over FHE. In the experiment, we first show the effectiveness of AutoHoG through a set of benchmark gates. We then apply AutoHoG to optimize common Boolean tasks, including adders, multipliers, the ISCAS'85 benchmark circuits, and the ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits.

A chaotic tent map was used for the initial population. Then, in this weak S-box, the elements were replaced with their neighbors, and the nonlinearity value was checked.

This approach has become attractive among many researchers due to its feature high Embedding Capacity (EC). In recent years, numerous methods are developed to secure the data. However, these methods still face problem in the area of imperceptibly and finding less distortion regions that is suitable for data hiding. To overcome this issue, a novel edge based Moving Objects (MO), compression technology, encryption method and interpolation data hiding technique based on moving regions detection that achieves less distortion is proposed in this paper. In the proposed system, first the video gets separated into frames, and edge based MO detection technique with graph system is used to identify the missing vertices. Then, compression technology with Rank Approximation (RA) and Prediction Error (PE) is applied for every frame. Next, we propose encryption scheme for MO which combines threshold and Pixel Value Differencing (PVD) to shuffle pixels, and non-MO applies circular shift encryption that preserve the pixels suitable for data hiding. Finally, the frames are up-scaled using weight based interpolation technique and data is hidden with various range inside Red Green Blue (RGB) channel by finding rough and smooth pixels. To ensure reversibility, any one channel is kept as the indication pixel for each pixel to store MO pixels. Experimental results reveals that the proposed method has significant improvement in the areas of compression level, MO identification and Quality Parameter (QP) testing. Moreover, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), EC, Regular Singular (RS) and PVD histogram analysis attacks obtained on the proposed method performs better than the other state-of-the-art techniques. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

The formal security verification of the proposed protocol is carried out using the ProVerif tool and the formal verification of mutual authentication is demonstrated using BAN logic. Its performance in terms of cost associated with communication, storage and computation along with its security aspects is compared to those of the other similar schemes. From such a comparison, it is evident that the proposed protocol is more secure. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

However, the occurrence of polymorphism-driven stimuli responses in crystalline materials remains interesting but rare. Herein, three polymorphs of an acylhydrazone derivative, N′-[(E)-(1-benzofuran-2-yl) methylidene] pyridine −4-carbohydrazide (BFMP) were prepared. Form-1 undergoes a photomechanical response via E→Z photoisomerization under UV irradiation, accompanied by a decrease in fluorescence intensity and a change from colorless to yellow. Two types of Z→E thermal isomerization mechanisms with significant differences in conversion rate were observed at different temperatures in form-1. The solid-melt-solid transition has a faster conversion rate compared to the solid-solid transition due to freedom from lattice confinement. The transition from form-2 to form-3 can be achieved under grinding, coupled with a significant decrease in fluorescence intensity. The similar molecular stacking pattern of form-2 and form-3 provides a structural basis for the grinding-induced crystalline transition behavior. In addition, the presence of the pyridine moiety imparts an acidochromic property. The combination of photochromism and acidochromism explores the possible applications of acylhydrazone derivatives in information encryption. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

These superior properties stem from the memristor representing the centerpiece of each memory cell and is branded as the fourth fundamental circuit element. Memristors encode information in the form of its resistance by altering the physical characteristics of their filament. Hence, each memristor can store multiple bits increasing the memory density and positioning it as a potential candidate to replace DRAM and SRAM-based memories, such as caches. However, new security risks arise with the benefits of these emerging technologies, like the recent NeuroHammer attack, which allows adversaries to deliberately flip bits in ReRAMs. While NeuroHammer has been shown to flip single bits within memristive crossbar arrays, the system-level impact remains unclear. Considering the significance of the Rowhammer attack on conventional DRAMs, NeuroHammer can potentially cause crucial damage to applications taking advantage of emerging memory technologies. To answer this question, we introduce NVgem5, a versatile system-level simulator based on gem5. NVgem5 is capable of injecting bit-flips in eNVMs originating from NeuroHammer. Our experiments evaluate the impact of the NeuroHammer attack on main and cache memories. In particular, we demonstrate a single-bit fault attack on cache memories leaking the secret key used during the computation of RSA signatures. Our findings highlight the need for improved hardware security measures to mitigate the risk of hardware-level attacks in computing systems based on eNVMs. © 2024 Owner/Author."

While enticing, FHE has two key challenges that limit its applicability: it has high performance overheads (10,000× over unencrypted computation) and it is extremely hard to program. Recent hardware accelerators and algorithmic improvements have reduced FHE's overheads and enabled large applications to run under FHE. These large applications exacerbate FHE's programmability challenges. Writing FHE programs directly is hard because FHE schemes expose a restrictive, low-level interface that prevents abstraction and composition. Specifically, FHE requires packing encrypted data into large vectors (tens of thousands of elements long), FHE provides limited operations on these vectors, and values have noise that grows with each operation, which creates unintuitive performance tradeoffs. As a result, translating large applications, like neural networks, into efficient FHE circuits takes substantial tedious work. We address FHE's programmability challenges with the Fhelipe FHE compiler. Fhelipe exposes a simple, numpy-style tensor programming interface, and compiles high-level tensor programs into efficient FHE circuits. Fhelipe's key contribution is automatic data packing, which chooses data layouts for tensors and packs them into ciphertexts to maximize performance. Our novel framework considers a wide range of layouts and optimizes them analytically. This lets compile large FHE programs efficiently, unlike prior FHE compilers, which either use inefficient layouts or do not scale beyond tiny programs. We evaluate on both a state-of-The-Art FHE accelerator and a CPU. is the first compiler that matches or exceeds the performance of large hand-optimized FHE applications, like deep neural networks, and outperforms a state-of-The-Art FHE compiler by gmean 18.5. At the same time, dramatically simplifies programming, reducing code size by 10-48.  © 2024 Owner/Author."

Biometric characteristics can be accessed by anyone, which poses a risk of unauthorized access to the system through spoofed biometric traits. Therefore, it is important to implement secure and efficient security schemes suitable for real-life applications, less computationally intensive, and invulnerable. This work presents a hybrid template protection scheme for secure face recognition in IoT-based environments, which integrates Cancelable Biometrics and Bio-Cryptography. Mainly, the proposed system involves two steps: 1) face recognition and 2) face biometric template protection. The face recognition includes face image preprocessing by the tree structure part model (TSPM), feature extraction by ensemble patch statistics (EPS) technique, and user classification by multiclass linear support vector machine (SVM). The template protection scheme includes cancelable biometric generation by modified FaceHashing and a Sliding-XOR (called S-XOR)-based novel Bio-Cryptographic technique. A user biometric-based key generation technique has been introduced for the employed Bio-Cryptography. Three benchmark facial databases, CVL, FEI, and FERET, have been used for the performance evaluation and security analysis. The proposed system achieves better accuracy for all the databases of 200-D cancelable feature vectors computed from the 500-D original feature vector. The modified FaceHashing and S-XOR method shows superiority over existing face recognition systems and template protection.  © 2014 IEEE."

This paper exposits a new method of scalable coding for encrypted images, especially for lossy compression images, using the Modified Absolute Moment Block Truncation Code (MAMBTC) technique. The given input image is compressed using MAMBTC and then encrypted using a Pseudo-Random Number (PRNG) at the encryption phase. The PRNG is shared between the encoder and the decoder. At the decryption phase, the compressed pixel value is obtained by decryption using the PRNG and then reconstructed using MAMBTC, scaled by factor 2, and the Bilinear Interpolation Technique to acquire the original image.

It is a method of computing that uses probability to represent and manipulate data, therefore it has applications in areas such as signal processing, machine learning, and cryptography. Stochastic steganography involves hiding a message within a cover image using a statistical model. Unlike traditional steganography techniques that use deterministic algorithms to embed the message, stochastic steganography uses a probabilistic approach to hide the message in a way that makes it difficult for an adversary to detect. Due to this error robustness and large bit streams stochastic computing, they are well suited for high capacity and secure image steganography. In this paper, as per the authors’ best knowledge, image steganography using stochastic computing based on linear feedback shift register (LFSR) is proposed for the first time. In the proposed technique, the cover image is converted to stochastic representation instead of the binary one, and then a secret image is embedded in it. The resulting stego image has a high PSNR value transmitted with no visual trace of the hidden image. The final results are stego image with PSNR starting from 30 dB and a maximum payload up to 40 bits per pixel (bpp) with an effective payload up to 28 bpp. The proposed method achieves high security and high capability of the number of stored bits in each pixel. Thus, the proposed method can prove a vital solution for high capacity and secure image steganography, which can then be extended to other types of steganography. © The Author(s) 2024."

To provide solution to above stated difficulty, a high dimensional image cryptosystem is proposed in this work. This study offers a novel Five Dimensional Gauss-Logistic DNA System (GLDS). The 5D GLDS is a complex five dimensional combination with DNA encoding of two popular 2D chaotic systems. Due to extensive pixel scrambling, the cryptographic complexity of the 5D Gauss Logistic Map is significantly increased. Further it is used with another hybrid chaotic maps combination, to realize the enhanced security in this work. The latter hybrid system incorporates a triad map, namely, the Standard map, Sine map, and Logistic map, which makes the system more resilient to attacks. The results show that the encoded image's histograms are equally distributed, with entropy values that are significantly closer to their bit depth. The system allows for a very large key space that can withstand crypto attacks. The statistical findings and security analysis indicate that the proposed 5D GLDS provides quality security when compared to some established cryptographic threats. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

The LiFi network is a high-capacity and security platform. A COVID-19 surveillance system using LiFi is proposed, which consists of two switching modes: communication and surveillance. Firstly, the communication targets are to accommodate the electromagnetic interference (EMI) immunity and high-capacity and security data transmission, where secondly the COVID-19 surveillance can be applied. In operation, the up and downlink system uses a metamaterial antenna embedded by Mach Zehnder interferometer (MZI). An antenna consists of silver bars embedded at the microring center with two-phase modulators at its sides. The entangled source namely a dark soliton is applied to form the transmission, where the information security based on quantum cryptography can be managed. By using the suitable parameters, the whispering gallery modes (WGMs) are generated and the up and downlink nodes are formed. The input information is multiplexed with time to form the multiplexed signals, where the big data transmission (40 Pbit s-1) can be employed. By using the surveillance mode, the plasmonic antenna can be applied for temperature and electric force sensors, which can offer the disinfectant spray and temperature sensor for COVID-19 applications. The optimum plasma force sensitivity is 0.16 N kg−1 mW−1. The center frequencies of 191.48 THz and 199.41 THz are obtained for uplink and downlink antennas, respectively.

In response, researchers are increasingly focusing on cryptographic solutions to ensure the reliability of confidential information. Recognizing the superiority of chaotic systems preference as entropy source of cryptographic systems, this paper proposes a novel true random number generator (TRNG) design by combining four different chaotic systems outputs, tailored for real-time video encryption application. These chaotic systems are continuous-time Lorenz and fractional-order Chen-Lee systems, as well as discrete-time Logistic and Tent maps. This study generates true random bit (TRB) sequences at a high bit rate (25 Mbps) through the hardware implementations of four distinct chaotic systems to have the best statistical randomness in the resulting output. Then, the cryptographic true random key bits (8-bit at 25 MHz frequency) are employed in the post-processing with real-time video data by using the XOR operation, a fundamental post-processing algorithm. The real-time video encryption application is executed on an experimental assembly, composed of a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) development kit, an OV7670 camera module, a VGA monitor, and prototype circuit boards for the chaotic systems. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed encryption system, several security assessments are conducted. These include NIST SP 800 − 22 statistical tests, FIPS 140-1 standards, chi-square tests, histogram and correlation analysis, and NPCR and UACI differential attack resilience tests. Consequently, the findings suggest that the presented real-time embedded cryptosystem is robust and suitable for secure communications, particularly in the realm of video transmission. © The Author(s) 2024."

Despite the visible confidentiality benefits, existing PEKS schemes suffer serious performance issues while deployed in real-world applications.

In this paper, we propose a new cryptographic primitive called multi-writer searchable encryption with aggregated keywords search that supports subset encrypted data validation. Specifically, one can perform fewer operations to identify all suggested keywords, thereby reducing the verifying cost.

However, this has brought some challenges, including issues of content security and copyright violation. In this paper, we propose a fusion-based secure watermarking algorithm that we have named “FuSIW”. This uses a hashing scheme, to guarantee copyright protection and authentication of RGB images. The algorithm uses the non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) to create a fused watermark image. This contourlet transform (CT) and randomised-singular-value-decomposition (RSVD) based approach allows concealment of the encrypted fused watermark image in the blue channel of the cover image. Subsequently, the hash value of the cover image is inserted into the green channels of the host image. Experimental evaluation indicates that the FuSIW algorithm provides security from geometric attacks and several other common forms of attack. Simulations indicate that the proposed system exhibits improved robustness and security compared to existing methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022."

Firstly, this paper proposes an adaptive sparsification compressed sensing (CS) to get a better reconstructed image by adaptively assigning a more appropriate sparsity threshold to each image. Secondly, considering the noise-like distribution of the measured values, this paper proposes a histogram-shifted least significant bit (LSB) Xor embedding method to reduce the variation of the cover image. The algorithm can also adaptively find the optimal histogram shift parameters based on the distribution of measured values to optimize the ciphertext quality. The peak signal-to-noise ratio of the ciphertext reaches more than 48dB, which is much higher than the existing optimal algorithm. Then, we also proposed a new two-dimensional infinite collapse hyperchaos (2D-IICM), whose two Lyapunov exponents (LE) both reach more than 4 and are in a hyperchaotic state. The sample entropy and information entropy of the sequence can also reach more than 2 and 7.9 respectively, which is 0.1 and 0.3 points higher than other chaos. Good chaos properties provide higher security to the algorithm. This paper uses SHA256 of plaintext to generate a dynamic key, so that the whole encryption system achieves the encryption effect of one-image and one-key, making the entire system highly resistant to attacks.

A widely used cloud service model is Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS). Clients offload their documents, images, and multimedia files to the cloud storage service. Securing the information of the clients is the challenging job of the cloud service providers (CSP). To ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) of the information CSP follows efficient encryption algorithms. To enhance the security of the image files this paper proposes a new Simplified Image Encryption Algorithm (SIEA) using an efficient key generation module, which uses the basic structure of Feistel cipher. The proposed secure algorithm encrypts the images and stores them in the cloud storage to overcome the data attack. The plain image is converted into corresponding pixel values and the converted plaintext is divided into blocks of 128 bits each. The 128-bit cipher key is used to find the sub-keys for 10 rounds. Five sub keys (K0 to K4) are generated with 32-bit each. It also contains 5 keys used in the 10 rounds of the process and after 10 rounds data will be shuffled again in the post-round step to generate the 128-bit cipher text. To ensure Shannon’s confusion and diffusion logic the substitution and permutation concepts are used in the proposed algorithm. To show the performance of the algorithm the images of three categories black and white, gray-scale, and color images are taken as input and the algorithm produces encrypted images. The cloud storage devices store the encrypted images. This proposed SIEA algorithm is compared with standard AES algorithms and other recent and competitive algorithms in terms of various statistical analysis methods like key sensitivity, information entropy, correlation, histogram, and differential attack analysis shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms in terms of security and robustness with its lightweight process. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Herein, an organoplatinum complex, Pt-ppy-ABP, carrying a salicylaldehyde-based Schiff base unit is synthesized. It exhibits weak emission in dilute solutions but shows bright emission at the aggregated state or after interacting with F- and Zn2+. This suggests that it has an aggregation-enhanced emission (AEE) property and holds potential in ion detection. Supported by theoretical calculations and femtosecond transient absorption results, this complex suffers excited-state structural changes including MCT from a square-planar configuration to a tetrahedral one, as well as intramolecular rotation of a monodentate ligand and ESIPT, showing weak emission in its solutions. At the aggregated state, it releases strong yellow emissions because of the restraints of MCT and ligand rotation. Upon interacting with F- or Zn2+, it emits bright-red or -green emissions, achieving detection limits of 10-7 M. The sensing mechanism is concluded as deprotonation- and coordination-induced ESIPT terminations, respectively. Given its AEE property and ion-responsive emissions, its application in information encryption is also explored.

While research has focused on attack detection, adversaries can outsmart even advanced anomaly detectors. Further, existing techniques fail to ensure data confidentiality, exposing telemetered data to eavesdropping. To address these evolving threats, we propose a novel framework to enhance power system data communication security over WANs. This innovative approach combines time series to image transformation, digital watermarking, and machine learning. These elements collaboratively encode sensor data into an unintelligible format, maintaining operational impact. We begin by converting time-series data into images with the Gramian Angular Field algorithm. These images are subtly embedded with invisible watermarks. The framework introduces an additional security layer to detect image tampering during communication. Using an Autoencoder-Support Vector Regression model, we restore the watermarked images to the original time series. Notably, the watermarking method is system-independent, maintains sensor data confidentiality, and certifies data integrity. In time-critical power system operations, traditional encryption and authentication can introduce latency. The proposed approach minimizes computational overhead and ensures real-time responsiveness, effectively securing power system data communications. To demonstrate the proposed framework's effectiveness, experiments were conducted on the IEEE-39 bus system's Automatic Generation Control system.  © 2010-2012 IEEE."

Specifically, those chaotic systems with high-dimension or special attractors have shown more benefits for enhancing performance. By introducing the tangent function, a 4-dimensional chaotic system with infinite coexisting attractors is constructed. And the dynamical behaviors are analyzed through phase diagrams, bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponent spectrum and spectral entropy complexity diagram. The results demonstrate that the system exhibits self-replication with respect to the initial value y0 and possesses rich dynamical properties, such as infinite coexisting attractors, sensitivity to initial values and period-doubling bifurcation. These characteristics make it suitable for chaotic cryptography applications. Subsequently, a lossless double color image encryption scheme is designed based on the constructed system. The scheme adopts a diffusion-scrambling-diffusion processing method, and cleverly utilizes the information of the original plaintext image in the scrambling process, which significantly enhances the ability to resist known plaintext attacks or selected plaintext attacks. The experimental results verify that the designed algorithm not only effectively encrypts color and grayscale images, but also allows for encryption images of any size. Moreover, the algorithm implementation process is efficient and ensures high security performance, effectively resisting differential attacks, rotation attacks and cropping attacks.

Users share their credentials like userid and password or use their smart cards to get authenticated by the application servers. Smart cards are handy to use, but they are susceptible to stolen smart card attacks and few other notable security attacks. Users prefer to use Web applications that guarantee for security against several security attacks, especially insider attacks, which is cru-cial. Cryptanalysis of several existing schemes prove the security pitfalls of the protocols from preventing security attacks, specifically insider attacks. This paper introduces LAPUP: a novel lightweight authentication protocol using physically unclonable function (PUF) to prevent security attacks, principally insider attacks. The PUFs are used to generate the security keys, challenge-response pair (CRP) and hardware signature for designing the LAPUP. The transmitted messages are shared as hash values and encrypted by the keys generated by PUF. These messages are devoid of all possible attacks executed by any attacker, including insider attacks. LAPUP is also free from stolen verifier attacks, as the databases are secured by using the hardware signature generated by PUFs. Security analysis of the protocol exhibits the strength of LAPUP in preventing insider attacks and its resistance against several other security attacks. The evaluation results of the communication and computation costs of LAPUP clearly shows that it achieves better performance than existing protocols, despite providing enhanced security. © 2024, Posts and Telecom Press Co Ltd.

In this paper, we propose a high-capacity reversible data hiding (RDH) algorithm combined with secure multi-party computation for telemedicine applications. The pixel values within a 3 × 3-size image block are divided into embedded pixels (EPs) and sampled pixels (SPs), secret data is embedded into the prediction errors of EPs and SPs in two stages. In the first stage, two edge servers predict EPs using the four SPs in the block to obtain the prediction error of EPs. The secret data is embedded into EPs through addition operation and histogram shift method. In the second stage, the prediction error of SPs is calculated as the difference between EPs and SPs, and the embedding of secret data follows the same method as used in the first stage. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a higher embedding rate compared to classical and state-of-the-art algorithms, with an average embedding rate of 0.47bpp on the UCID dataset.

Its purpose is to maintain long-term personal records and health improvement plans. It combines a cloud computing environment to build a personal health records system to quickly collect personal information and transfer it to the back end for storage for future access. However, in a cloud environment, the message transmission process is more open. Therefore, a lack of an authority security mechanism for the users of such an architecture will result in distrust and doubt by the users. This adversely affects the implementation and quality of long-term health plans. To protect the crucial privacy of the users from malicious attacks or theft, it is necessary to ensure that the users have different authority to access their personal health records under the cloud computing environment and manage the openness of their authority to other users. A secured identify authentication mechanism can ensure that only legitimate users can log in to the system and obtain system service resources through verification. For a personal health records system in the cloud computing environment, this study proposes a secure and reliable user authentication mechanism allowing relevant users access to the user’s PHR in the cloud based on their authority.

Here, we report leveraging coupling kinematic bifurcation in rigid cube–based mechanisms with elasticity to create transformable, multistable mechanical computing metastructures with stable, high-density mechanical memory. Simply stretching the planar metastructure forms a multistable corrugated platform. It allows for independent mechanical or magnetic actuation of individual bistable element, serving as pop-up voxels for display or binary units for various tasks such as information writing, erasing, reading, encryption, and mechanologic computing. Releasing the pre-stretched strain stabilizes the prescribed information, resistant to external mechanical or magnetic perturbations, whereas re-stretching enables editable mechanical memory, akin to selective zones or disk formatting for information erasure and rewriting.

An excellent S-box is necessary for the block cipher algorithm, and its cipher strength directly affects the security of the cipher algorithm. The differential uniformity of the S-box generated by the chaotic system is 10 or 12, which cannot effectively resist differential cryptanalysis. Aiming at the high differential uniformity of the S-box constructed by the chaotic system, a novel efficient S-box construction scheme based on a new chaotic map and permutation is proposed in this paper. In this scheme, the chaotic matrix is generated by a new chaotic map, and then is replaced by permutation sequences to generate S-boxes. Comparative analysis shows that the generated S-boxes have high nonlinearity, low differential uniformity, and satisfy SAC and BIC criteria, which can improve the ability of the algorithm to resist differential cipher attacks and linear cryptographic analysis. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

In response to the above issues, this article proposes a hybrid homomorphic encryption scheme FHE-LowMC, which combines the LowMC symmetric encryption algorithm with the BGV homomorphic encryption algorithm to analyze the homomorphic noise of LowMC in the BGV homomorphic encryption environment. First, a method for encoding the LowMC plaintext into integer coefficient polynomials is proposed, which utilizes encoding and decoding to complete the conversion of plaintext messages in different spaces. Then, the selection rules for the cyclotomic polynomial f(X) is described, with the conditions f(X) suitable for the LowMC encryption algorithm given. Afterwards, the homomorphic noise of the simplified LowMC is analyzed. Finally, homomorphic noise evaluation is performed on LowMC under general conditions. The results show that the number of circuit layers consumed by the LowMC round function is about two. Compared with the currently commonly used AES and BGV combination scheme, the scheme combining LowMC and BGV has a lower noise, which means it consumes fewer layers of circuits and has lower costs, making it more suitable for constructing cloud servers based on homomorphisms. In addition. users can independently select the parameter set(n, k, m, d )of LowMC, which meets the different needs of users and has a wider scope of application. © 2024 ournal of Xidian University.

With the rapid development of financial industry, the scale of the financial cryptographic services continues to expand, and the volume of terminal devices increased significantly, causing problems such as system complexity and extreme workload. The centralized data processing model enabled by cloud computing can ease these problems to some extent, but when the data produced by various kinds of devices (e.g. IoT devices) continues to increase rapidly, cloud computing-based services subsequentially cannot meet the demand of real-time and efficient data processing. The edge computing is an emerging computing model, which is capable of hierarchically managing the resource, and supporting the deployment of cryptographic services at the edge. The edge computing-based cryptographic service separates data encryption/ decryption processing and provides low-level interfaces for financial business systems. It could simplify the way financial business systems obtain cryptographic services. In this paper, we propose an edge oriented cryptographic key management service, which consists of system monitor module, key management module and security management module. The proposed service enables the management of the whole life cycle of cryptographic keys, and reconstructs the process of cryptographic key. In a 1-year continuous testing, the proposed system achieved a total of 36 million cryptographic key distributions, and each cryptographic key has a lifecycle of 1.5 days on average. The TPS reached 15,000, and the system availability reached 99.99% throughout the year.

However, fine-tuning hydrochromic response to water content remains unfulfilled research, posing constraints in the widespread application of hydrochromic luminescence. This study reports a 0D Rb3TbF6 perovskite with highly controllable hydrochromic characteristics. The Rb3TbF6 crystals exhibit a distinct hydrochromic luminescence switching after B-site doping with Eu3+, stemming from Rb3TbF6 to Rb2TbF5 transformation that triggers intra-crystal Tb3+-to-Eu3+ energy transfer. Through A-site alkaline metal alloying, the sensitivity of the perovskite to water stimuli is precisely tuned, rendering distinct responses over a wide range of humidity conditions (RH: 1–90% RH) and water levels (v/v: 0.5–55%). As an added benefit, the hydrochromic crystals also show excellent repeatability and photothermal stability.

Complex mathematical operation can be greatly simplified by adopting Vedic mathematics. Efficient arithmetic operations are required to carry out real-time applications. Multipliers are frequently employed in signal processing. Hence multipliers can be designed using a squarer unit. Squaring Circuit offers a very good performance in terms of speed. Thus squaring module becomes the fundamental operation in any arithmetic unit. The squaring operation is frequently employed in cryptography also. On the whole, squaring operation is widely encountered in multipliers. While designing multipliers, it is essential to reduce the hardware complexity with less power consumption. Vedic mathematics simplifies the design concepts and thus paves the way for high-speed applications. On comparing the various Vedic sutras, Yavadunam sutra is highly efficient from logic utilization and is found to be suitable for high-speed digital applications. Hence, a squaring architecture has been designed using Yavadunam sutra, an ancient sutra of Vedic mathematics without using a multiplier circuit. The proposed acceleration strategy employs only addition operations. The design is simulated and realized using Xilinx Isim Simulator. © 2023 Scrivener Publishing LLC. All rights reserved."

We used very different formal-reasoning techniques throughout the stack, ranging from computer algebra, symbolic execution, and verification-condition generation to interactive verification of functional programs including compilers for C-like and functional languages. All these component specifications and domain-specific reasoning techniques are defined and justified against common foundations in the Coq proof assistant. Connecting these components is a minimalistic specification style based on functional programs and assertions over simple objects, omnisemantics for program execution, and basic separation logic for memory layout. This design enables us to bring the components together in a top-level correctness theorem that can be audited without understanding or trusting the internal interfaces and tools. Our case study is a simple cryptographic server for flipping of a bit of state through public-key authenticated network messages, and its proof shows total functional correctness including static bounds on memory usage.

The theoretical foundations of our method are based on a special matrix - quasi-d -differential transition matrix, which is a natural extension of the quasi-differential transition matrix. The role of quasi-d -differential transition matrices in polytopic cryptanalysis is analogous to that of correlation matrices in linear cryptanalysis. Therefore, the fixed-key probability of a d -differential can be exactly expressed as the sum of the correlations of its quasi-d -differential trails. Then we revisit the boomerang attack from a perspective of 3-differential. Different from previous works, the probability of a boomerang distinguisher can be exactly expressed as the sum of the correlations of its quasi-3-differential trails without any assumptions in our work. In order to illustrate our theory, we apply it to the lightweight block cipher GIFT. It is interesting to find the probability of every optimal 3-differential characteristic of an existing 2-round boomerang is zero, which can be seen as an evidence that the security of block ciphers adopting half-round key XOR might be overestimated previously to some extent in differential-like attacks. © 1963-2012 IEEE."

Cs2NaInCl6:Sb, Cs2KInCl6:Sb, and Cs2AgInCl6:Sb synthesized through coprecipitation methods exhibit broadband emissions with bright blue, cyan, and orange colors, respectively. The information transmitted by specific SDPP is encrypted when different SDPPs are mixed. The confidential information can be decrypted by selecting the corresponding narrowband filter. Then, an encrypted quick response (QR) code with improved security is demonstrated based on this multi-channel selection strategy. Moreover, the three types of SDPPs exhibit three different water-triggered luminescence switching behaviors. The confidential information represented by Cs2NaInCl6:Sb can be erased/recovered through a simple water spray/drying. Whereas, the information collected from the green channel is permanently erased by moisture, which fundamentally avoids information leakage. Therefore, different encryption schemes can be designed to meet a variety of encryption requirements.

These networks efficiently perform complex tasks with a high level of intelligence without human intervention and require run-time processing and computation. Edge computing is introduced where devices are placed at the edge between the data source and the cloud. These devices can provide more powerful computational and storage capabilities to IoT users. With various benefits, one of the significant requirements is secure and trustworthy data communication. Various trust management schemes are introduced to guarantee the trustworthiness and isolation of the malicious nodes and give preference to the most trustworthy ones. The existing schemes selected trustworthy nodes again and again from the path without considering the load factor which leads them to be more vulnerable for the Denial of Services (DoS) attacks.

Quantum computing endeavors to establish higher computing standards that can potentially solve complex structures. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has emerged as one of the new domains of cryptography, which is resilient to quantum attacks owing to the revolution in quantum computing. To ensure quantum security, the lattice-based cryptosystem (LB-cryptosystem) is one of the promising tools of PQC to address quantum-based threats. The traditional security algorithms, such as RSA and Diffie–Hellman (DH), are strong enough to resist present security threats. However, it has been predicted that quantum technologies have the capability to break the security of most traditional algorithms whose security is based on prime factorization and DH-type hard problems. Therefore, research is currently focused on addressing the security and privacy threats by using LB-cryptosystems to secure various applications, organizations' data, and information infrastructure in the quantum era. The purpose of this article is to investigate recent advances in LB-cryptosystems that may allow the design of secure models for smart-grid networks (SGNs) against existing and future quantum attacks. SGNs have been explored as the bi-directional assimilation of communication in terms of electricity generation, transmission, allocation, and utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of LB-cryptosystems, as well as their potential applications in securing SGNs. Lastly, the article summarizes the various PQC primitives, NIST selected algorithms, open-source tools along with their packages, and various PQC industrial initiatives, and also compares traditional cryptographic schemes with other PQC. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

The response to these challenges has been the development of cryptography applications, though many existing techniques face issues of complexity, efficiency, and limitations. Notably, sophisticated intruders can easily discern encrypted data during transmission, casting doubt on overall security. In contrast to encryption, steganography offers the unique advantage of concealing data without easy detection, although it, too, grapples with challenges. The primary hurdles in image steganography revolve around the quality and payload capacity of the cover image, which are persistently compromised. This article introduces a pioneering approach that integrates image steganography and encryption, presenting the BitPatternStego method. This novel technique addresses prevalent issues in image steganography, such as stego-image quality and payload, by concealing secret data within image pixels with identical bit patterns as their characters. Consequently, concerns regarding the quality and payload capacity of steganographic images become obsolete. Moreover, the BitPatternStego method boasts the capability to generate millions of keys for the same secret message, offering a robust and versatile solution to the evolving landscape of digital security challenges. © 2024 KSII."

Fuzzy min-entropy measures the limit of the length of key that a fuzzy extractor can derive from a distribution (Fuller et al. in IEEE Trans Inf Theory 66(8):5282–5298, 2020). In general, fuzzy min-entropy that is superlogarithmic in the security parameter is required for a noisy distribution to be suitable for key derivation. There is a wide gap between what is possible with respect to computational and information-theoretic adversaries. Under the assumption of general-purpose obfuscation, keys can be securely derived from all distributions with superlogarithmic entropy. Against information-theoretic adversaries, however, it is impossible to build a single fuzzy extractor that works for all distributions (Fuller et al. 2020). A weaker information-theoretic goal is building a fuzzy extractor for each probability distribution. This is the approach taken by Woodage et al. (in: Advances in Cryptology—CRYPTO, Springer, pp 682–710, 2017). Prior approaches use the full description of the probability mass function and are inefficient. We show this is inherent: for a quarter of distributions with fuzzy min-entropy and 2kpoints there is no secure fuzzy extractor that uses less 2Θ(k)bits of information about the distribution. We show an analogous result with stronger parameters for information-theoretic secure sketches. Secure sketches are frequently used to construct fuzzy extractors. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Such data are shared by cloud providers for storage and further processing. Medical images contain sensitive information, and these images are shared with healthcare workers, patients, and, in some scenarios, researchers for diagnostic and study purposes. However, the security of these images in the transfer process is extremely important, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper proposes a secure watermarking algorithm, termed WatMIF, based on multimodal medical image fusion. The proposed algorithm consists of three major parts: the encryption of the host media, the fusion of multimodal medical images, and the embedding and extraction of the fused mark. We encrypt the host media with a key-based encryption scheme. Then, a nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT)-based fusion scheme is employed to fuse the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scan images to generate the fused mark image. Furthermore, the encrypted host media conceals the fused watermark using redundant discrete wavelet transform (RDWT) and randomised singular value decomposition (RSVD). Finally, denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNN) is used to improve the robustness of the WatMIF algorithm. The simulation experiments on two standard datasets were used to evaluate the algorithm in terms of invisibility, robustness, and security. When compared with the existing algorithms, the robustness is improved by 20.14%. Overall, the implementation of proposed watermarking for hiding fused marks and efficient encryption improved the identity verification, invisibility, robustness and security criteria in our WatMIF algorithm. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022."

With only one factor, it is hard for an adversary to impersonate the client to pass the authentication, and thus 2FA provides better security than single-factor authentication schemes. However, as far as we know, all existing 2FA schemes do not consider the leakage of server's database, and their authenticity may fail when the database is also compromised (in addition to one factor). Considering numerous reports of database leakage in the real world, it seems imminent to study and design 2FA schemes resilient to database leakage. In this paper, we formalize security models for 2FA schemes by taking database leakage into account. Our security models consider malicious adversaries who can obtain both the client's one authentication factor and the server's database, and have two requirements, authenticity and zero-knowledge. Authenticity ensures that such malicious adversaries cannot impersonate the client to pass the authentication, while zero-knowledge guarantees that such malicious adversaries obtain no information about the client's the other factor. Zero-knowledge is especially important for biometric features (like faces, fingerprints), which are inherent to human beings and can hardly be changed. Then we propose a biometric-based 2FA scheme with biometric feature and secret key serving as the two authentication factors. Our 2FA scheme has three rounds, and we prove its authenticity and zero-knowledge under database leakage in the random oracle model. Notably, our construction makes a novel use of a recent technical advance called robust property-preserving hashing (Boyle et al., ITCS 2019) together with fully homomorphic encryption, to recognize or discern clients by their biometric samplings in a homomorphic and secure way. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Therefore, this study proposes an intrusion detection approach for a realistic IoT environment, employing various variants of deep learning models such as deep neural networks (DNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The research tested three variants for each model: DNN1, DNN2, DNN3, CNN1, CNN2, CNN3, RNN1, RNN2, RNN3. All these variants are customized and tuned differently to analyze the efficacy of the suggested methodology. Likewise, notable observation highlights the significance of aligning training and validation accuracy curves that indicate controlled overfitting, validating the model’s reliability in accurately predicting intrusion and benign network traffic in IoT settings. Results reveal that RNN1 achieves the best results: accuracy of 98.61%, precision of 98.55%, recall of 98.61%, and F1-score of 98.57% compared with other DNN and CNN architectures and benchmark papers.

Furthermore, with the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and information technologies, more and more manufacturing systems become cyber-enabled, facilitating real-time data sharing and information exchange, which significantly improves the flexibility and efficiency of manufacturing systems. However, the cyber-enabled environment may pose the collected sensor data with high risks of cyber-physical attacks during the data and information sharing. Specifically, cyber-physical attacks could target the manufacturing process and/or the data transmission process to maliciously tamper the sensor data, resulting in false alarms or failures in anomaly detection in monitoring. In addition, cyber-physical attacks may also enable illegal data access without authorization and cause the leakage of key product/process information. Therefore, it becomes critical to develop an effective approach to protect data from these attacks so that the cyber-physical security of the manufacturing systems can be assured in the cyber-enabled environment.

Lattice-based cryptosystems are regarded as the most promising one for post-quantum eara by NIST, while the known multi-server password-based authentication solution over lattices achieves merely key transport and is public key infrastructure (PKI)-based, resulting in low efficiency and poor deployability. In this work, we resort to distributed smooth projective hash function (SPHF) to bridge the gap between multi-server PAKE protocol and quantum-security. We first design an exact SPHF and derive the first distributed SPHF over lattices by leveraging the additive homomorphic property of the strong learning with errors (LWE) problem. In particular, the relevant parameters of the public key encryption (PKE) scheme it predicates on are identified, thus eliminating the influence of incomplete lattice homomorphism on the correctness of our SPHFs. Pertinent lattice-based multi-server PAKE protocols are further proposed on both transparent and non-transparent transmission modes by integrating our distributed SPHF into the multi-server framework of Raimondo and Gennaro (EUROCRYPT’03). Our PAKE constructions are able to resist both quantum and sever compromise attacks as well as avoid the expensive cryptographic primitives, including non-interactive zero knowledge (NIZK) proofs, signature/verification, secret sharing and fully homomorphic encryption. Experimental results demonstrate that our SPHFs and PAKE protocols offer better efficiency. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

In the NLFSR, the feedback function is applied to each state, not only the last bit of NLFSR. In the proposed design the size of the feedback is reduced using Galois configuration. The NLFSR is tested with NIST Statistical Test Suite to evaluate its quality randomness. The new NLFSR is used as an pseudorandom number generator to design a new lightweight image encryption algorithm. The encryption process can be represent in two phases permutation and diffusion. In the first phase, two different PRNSs generated by the new NLFSR for permute the row and column pixels of the plain image (PI). Then convert the permuted image into a 1D binary vector. In the diffusion phase, DNA arithmetic is applied between the 1D and another PRNS generated by the same NLFSR with different key. Several security analysis tests are performed on the proposed scheme (like histogram analysis, entropy, correlation coefficient, NPCR, UACI, MSE, and PSNR ) to test the security strength of the encryption method. It was found that the new NLFSR had passes all the tests in NIST Statistical Test Suite, and the test results of the encryption scheme are also acceptable and shows potential security strength. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

However, the reduction of redundancy leads to decreased data availability and unbalanced data distribution. This paper proposes a blockchain-based decentralized storage system with reliable deduplication and storage balance strategy to provide reliability for deduplicated outsourced data. Encrypted data is split into chunks by a ramp secret sharing scheme, and it is distributed to multiple independent cloud servers. States of the chunks are recorded on the tamper-proofed blockchain and they can be used to recover the raw data or support the verification of user identity. To balance the distribution of data among storage servers, a heuristic matching algorithm is designed to efficiently allocate the available storage space. The allocation services are published by autonomous smart contracts and other participants gain rewards by giving the best matching results of data chunks and storage servers. Formulation analysis demonstrates the correctness of the proposed scheme in terms of data consistency, integrity, and reliability. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme preserves the confidentiality of outsourced data with acceptable computational consumption.  © 2013 IEEE."

In particular, we show a reduction from the sum-rank metric (CEsr) to the rank metric (CErk). To obtain this result, we investigate reductions between tensor problems. We define the monomial isomorphism problem for d-tensors (d-TI∗), where, given two d-tensors, we ask if there are d-1 invertible matrices and a monomial matrix sending one tensor into the other. We link this problem to the well-studied d-TI and the TI-completeness of d-TI∗ is shown. Due to this result, we obtain a reduction from CEsr to CErk. In the literature, a similar result was known, but it needs an additional assumption on the automorphisms of matrix codes.

At first, the blockchain system is modelled and then the input data is acquired from the databases, which is forwarded to the patient’s medical data preservation phase.

However, due to the intermittent nature of such resources, the net energy availability within microgrids varies with time. This adversely affects the power balance within microgrids, especially if energy storage systems or grid support are unavailable. In such cases, the microgrids in a locality can form a network to trade power among themselves. The most transparent and fair method is power trading using a double auction with sealed bidding. A novel method for sealed bid power trading using consortium blockchains that is entirely decentralized is introduced, ensuring better operational and data security. Here, all bidding data are shared twice. During bidding time, bids are shared by participating microgrids using one-way encryption and are added to the blockchain by all participants. After the bid closure, the respective microgrids share the same data unencrypted. By encrypting and comparing the bid data with the encrypted data already added to the blockchains, other participants can verify whether the microgrids have kept their bid data unmodified post-bid-closure. If the data has been kept unmodified, all participants add the bid data as verified data to their blockchain. Successful bids are then identified using a smart contract, and power transfer is effected accordingly. All power and monetary transactions are recorded distributively in blockchains. A decentralised framework for the implementation of the method is also envisaged. Further, a novel approach is proposed for distributively authenticating the blocks shared by participating microgrids using public and shared keys. The method and the framework are then successfully tested for decentralization, transparency, resilience, public verifiability, and transaction enforcement using simulations in a benchmark test system for networked microgrids. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Herein, the “Surface-Filming Assembly” (SFA) strategy for conveniently and efficiently modulating CPL by taking the perovskite/chiral helical polyacetylene system as a model is proposed and established. This strategy can facilely achieve multicolor CPL by simply changing the color (or number) of perovskite fluorescent layers and/or the attaching order of the perovskite layers in the assembled multilayer film. Compared with previously reported methods, the SFA strategy integrates the preparation process and adjustment in one single step, simplifying the preparation process (especially the preparation of perovskite with different ratios of halogen atoms) and making adjustment simple and efficient.

Applications can be migrated to CVM without changes, i.e., lift and shift, to handle sensitive workloads securely in public clouds. AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) is one of the prominent technologies that provides hardware support for CVM. In this paper, we investigate various system operations, including CPU, memory, and disk and network I/O, to understand the performance overheads of SEV-supported CVMs. Our findings indicate that memory and I/O-intensive workloads can incur significant overhead. We then study the performance implications of running unmodified database applications, specifically Cock-roachDB, on CVMs by examining typical data access patterns of OLTP and OLAP workloads. A notable performance overhead of up to 18% is observed for TPC-C workload running on multinode database clusters, and an overhead of up to 13% is observed for TPC-H workload running on single-node database instances. The non-negligible overhead suggests the potential and necessity for database optimizations with respect to CVM, particularly for time-sensitive workloads. We offer a glimpse of the effect that CVM overhead can have in query planning using a simple join query: the optimal join algorithm becomes suboptimal on CVM, along with discussion of potential optimizations for reducing CVM overhead in the realm of database applications.  © 2024 Owner/Author."

In this study, we present a dual stimuli-responsive photoluminescence (PL) switching system that depends on both temperature and excitation wavelength, utilizing a Zero-Dimensional (0D) (PMA)4In0.98Sb0.02Cl7·H2O (PMA = benzylamine). Notably, (PMA)4In0.98Sb0.02Cl7·H2O exhibits orange broad-band emission at room temperature under both low-energy (365 nm) and high-energy (254 nm) irradiation. At 80 K, green light emission is observed under high-energy irradiation (254 nm), transforming into red emission when excited with low-energy wavelength (365 nm) at the same temperature. Moreover, the (PMA)4In0.98Sb0.02Cl7·H2O both in powder and film states demonstrate excellent stimuli-responsive performance, including short response times and superior cyclic reversibility.

Following this trend, in this paper, we propose a novel hardware-implemented Lightweight Accelerator for the large integer polynomial MultiPlication (LAMP) used in PQC schemes. Specifically, we target the polynomial multiplications not bound by fixed fast algorithms like Number Theoretic Transform (NTT), i.e., Falcon (one of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) selected PQC algorithms) and Ring Binary Learning-with-Errors based encryption scheme (RBLWE-ENC, a promising lightweight PQC scheme). Overall, we have carried out three layers of innovative efforts. (i) A new lightweight computation strategy for the targeted polynomial multiplication is proposed; (ii) The new accelerator is then designed based on the proposed algorithm (applicable for both targeted schemes); (iii) A thorough evaluation process is carried out to showcase the superior performance of the proposed accelerator over the competing designs, e.g., at least 21.2% less area-delay product (ADP) when LAMP is used for RBLWE-ENC (on Virtex-7 device).

However, due to the infamous Sybil attack, nominal models are not sufficient to express the trust assumptions in open (i.e., permissionless) settings. Instead, permissionless systems typically operate in a weighted model, where each participant is associated with a weight and the adversary can corrupt a set of parties holding at most a fraction fw of the total weight.In this paper, we suggest a simple way to transform a large class of protocols designed for the nominal model into the weighted model. To this end, we formalize and solve three novel optimization problems, which we collectively call the weight reduction problems, that allow us to map large real weights into small integer weights while preserving the properties necessary for the correctness of the protocols. In all cases, we manage to keep the sum of the integer weights to be at most linear in the number of parties, resulting in extremely efficient protocols for the weighted model. Moreover, we demonstrate that, on weight distributions that emerge in practice, the sum of the integer weights tends to be far from the theoretical worst case and, sometimes, even smaller than the number of participants.While, for some protocols, our transformation requires an arbitrarily small reduction in resilience (i.e., fw = fn - ϵ), surprisingly, for many important problems, we manage to obtain weighted solutions with the same resilience (fw = fn) as nominal ones. Notable examples include erasure-coded distributed storage and broadcast protocols, verifiable secret sharing, and asynchronous consensus. Although there are ad-hoc weighted solutions to some of these problems, the protocols yielded by our transformations enjoy all the benefits of nominal solutions, including simplicity, efficiency, and a wider range of possible cryptographic assumptions. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

We validate the security using BAN logic and the Scyther tool and assess performance through experiments in a real hardware environment.

Herein, a host-guest doping strategy was proposed to produce afterglow materials with an emission-color span of almost 210 nm (from blue to deep red) by heat treating the aqueous mixture of arylboronic acids and boric acid (BA). In-depth structural, photophysical, and theoretical studies revealed that the heat treatment process resulted in the dehydration of BA and the formation of a glassy state host, and arylboronic acids were loaded as guest molecules through H-bonds and covalent bonds with BA. The afterglow originated from arylboronic acids, and the afterglow color of products was related to their degree of conjugation of aromatic groups. The host-guest doping strategy significantly improved the photophysical performances of arylboronic acids, achieving a photoluminescence quantum yield as high as 81.7% and an emission lifetime of 2.90 s (afterglow >22 s).

To determine the key length and number of computation cycles per bit of the ECC to be attacked, the proposed adaptive attack employs an adaptive leakage-windowing technique and correlation analysis on the power trace obtained from an ECC module with a secret key. The point of interest (POI) is identified at the bit with the maximum difference in leakage between key bits 1 and 0 using the leakage window per bit. The trace from the victim ECC hardware with secret key is compared to those collected in prior templates with key bits 1 and 0 to recover the key. To validate the performance, a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA chip was used to implement an Edward-curve digital signature algorithm (EdDSA) with Ed25519 and SHA-512 accelerators. The experimental results show a favorable key recovery rate of 100%. Further attack results are presented for the ECC modules with advanced countermeasures against side-channel attack, such as projective coordinate and/or scalar randomization. It is validated that the proposed adaptive attack is able to exploit successfully 100% of the keys of ML-based ECC accelerators without and with countermeasures of projective coordinate or scalar randomization.

To address this challenge, authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocols have gained significant attention and are regarded as indispensable tools for ensuring the secure operation of the smart grid. However, traditional AKA protocols are plagued by a series of issues, including cumbersome certificate management, delayed certificate revocation, and vulnerability to man-in-the-middle attacks. With the emergence of certificateless public key cryptography (CL-PKC), the integration of conventional AKA protocols with CL-PKC has emerged as a prominent trend. This article presents an enhanced certificateless AKA protocol for smart grids, named ECL-AKA. First, this article outlines the architecture and security model of this protocol. Subsequently, it presents the complete workflow of the ECL-AKA protocol. Notably, the ECL-AKA protocol introduces a private key verification step before key agreement, allowing for rapid screening of malicious requests at a lower computational cost, thereby enhancing the protocol's resistance to various types of attacks. In addition, the ECL-AKA's security is formally established through rigorous theoretical proofs based on the random oracle model in this article. Finally, comparative experimental analysis demonstrates that the ECL-AKA exhibits lower computational and communication overhead while satisfying essential security attributes.  © 2014 IEEE."

In this work, we present a novel approach to control the dynamic phosphorescence color and stimulus response properties of CQDs coated on paper by fine-tuning the surface functional groups of the CQDs. Specifically, histidine and 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine was separately used to prepare N, O co-doped CQDs (NOCQDs) and N-doped CQDs (NCQDs), respectively. These CQDs were further coated on filter paper substrates to achieve water and heating cascade stimulus–response RTP. These stimuli-responsive properties of NOCQDs can be modulated by deprotonating their surface oxygen-containing groups. Eventually, we achieved time-resolved multicolor dynamic anti-counterfeiting by exploiting the stimuli-response properties and lifetimes differences between NOCQDs and NCQDs, realizing the 5D information encryption in all five stimulus-, pattern-, time-, and color-dependent codes. These findings highlight the potential of NOCQDs as advanced anti-counterfeiting materials and lay a foundation for further exploration into the synthesis and properties of CQDs with tunable stimuli-response features and RTP emission. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The new tools enable a shard of nodes to to jointly broadcast (or securely contribute a secret) to the whole population only at the cost of one dealer (as if there is a representative).With our new Dragon method, we construct the first two DKG protocols, both achieving optimal resilience, with sub-cubic total communication and computation. The first DKG generates a secret key within an Elliptic Curve group, incurring Õ(n2·5λ) total communication and computation. The second DKG, while slightly increasing communication and computation by a factor of the statistical security parameter, generates a secret key as a field element, which makes it directly compatible with various off-the-shelf DLog-based threshold cryptographic systems. We also construct a first deterministic IC with sub-cubic communication. © 2024 Association for Computing Machinery. All rights reserved."

They are necessary for the existence of non-trivial classical cryptosystems, and also sufficient to realize meaningful primitives including commitments, pseudorandom generators and digital signatures. At the same time, a mounting body of evidence suggests that assumptions even weaker than one-way functions may suffice for many cryptographic tasks of interest in a quantum world, including bit commitments and secure multi-party computation. This work studies one-way state generators [Morimae-Yamakawa, CRYPTO 2022], a natural quantum relaxation of one-way functions. Given a secret key, a one-way state generator outputs a hard to invert quantum state. A fundamental question is whether this type of quantum one-wayness suffices to realize quantum cryptography. We obtain an affirmative answer to this question, by proving that one-way state generators with pure state outputs imply quantum bit commitments and secure multiparty computation. Along the way, we use efficient shadow tomography [Huang et. al., Nature Physics 2020] to build an intermediate primitive with classical outputs, which we call a (quantum) one-way puzzle. Our main technical contribution is a proof that one-way puzzles imply quantum bit commitments. This proof develops new techniques for pseudoentropy generation [Hastad et. al., SICOMP 1999] from arbitrary distributions, which may be of independent interest. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Multiaccurate predictors are correct in expectation on each member of an arbitrary collection of pre-specified sets. Multicalibrated predictors satisfy a stronger condition: they are calibrated on each set in the collection. Multiaccuracy is equivalent to a regularity notion for functions defined by Trevisan, Tulsiani, and Vadhan (2009). They showed that, given a class F of (possibly simple) functions, an arbitrarily complex function g can be approximated by a low-complexity function h that makes a small number of oracle calls to members of F, where the notion of approximation requires that h cannot be distinguished from g by members of F. This complexity-theoretic Regularity Lemma is known to have implications in different areas, including in complexity theory, additive number theory, information theory, graph theory, and cryptography. Starting from the stronger notion of multicalibration, we obtain stronger and more general versions of a number of applications of the Regularity Lemma, including the Hardcore Lemma, the Dense Model Theorem, and the equivalence of conditional pseudo-min-entropy and unpredictability. For example, we show that every boolean function (regardless of its hardness) has a small collection of disjoint hardcore sets, where the sizes of those hardcore sets are related to how balanced the function is on corresponding pieces of an efficient partition of the domain. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

However, challenges still exist in ensuring privacy and security within the interactions. To address these issues, this article proposes a federated learning approach that incorporates blockchain, homomorphic encryption, and reputation. Using homomorphic encryption, edge nodes possessing local data can complete the training of ciphertext models, with their contributions to the aggregation being evaluated by a reputation mechanism. Both models and reputations are documented and verified on the blockchain through the consensus process, which then determines the rewards based on the incentive mechanism. This approach not only incentivizes participation in training, but also ensures the privacy of data and models through encryption. Additionally, it addresses security risks associated with both data and network attacks, ultimately leading to a highly accurate trained model. To enhance the efficiency of learning and the performance of the model, a joint adaptive aggregation and resource optimization algorithm is introduced. Finally, simulations and analyses demonstrate that the proposed scheme enhances learning accuracy while maintaining privacy and security.  © 2014 IEEE."

White light emission was observed by physical incorporation of hydroxyl-functionalized spiropyran (SPOH) into the colloidal polymer particles in a certain ratio of the colloidal polymer particles and SPOH content. The white light emission was obtained by modulating pH and temperature to finely tune the Förster resonance energy transfer process and cover the entire visible spectra from the emissive lights.

We show that there exist unitaries U such that no quantum polynomial-time oracle algorithm Af can implement U, even approximately, if it only makes one (quantum) query to f. Our approach also has implications for quantum cryptography: we prove (relative to a random oracle) the existence of quantum cryptographic primitives that remain secure against all one-query adversaries Af. Since such one-query algorithms can decide any language, solve any classical search problem, and even prepare any quantum state, our result suggests that implementing random unitaries and breaking quantum cryptography may be harder than all of these tasks. To prove this result, we formulate unitary synthesis as an efficient challenger-adversary game, which enables proving lower bounds by analyzing the maximum success probability of an adversary Af. Our main technical insight is to identify a natural spectral relaxation of the one-query optimization problem, which we bound using tools from random matrix theory. We view our framework as a potential avenue to rule out polynomial-query unitary synthesis, and we state conjectures in this direction. © 2024 Owner/Author."

ACM 1991) shows that the existence of a one-way function is sufficient for constructing computational zero knowledge (CZK) proofs for all languages in NP. We prove its converse, thereby establishing characterizations of one-way functions based on the worst-case complexities of zero knowledge. Specifically, we prove that the following are equivalent: - A one-way function exists. - NP ⊆ CZK and NP is hard in the worst case. - CZK is hard in the worst case and the problem GapMCSP of approximating circuit complexity is in CZK. The characterization above also holds for statistical and computational zero-knowledge argument systems. We further extend this characterization to a proof system with knowledge complexity O(log n). In particular, we show that the existence of a one-way function is characterized by the worst-case hardness of CZK if GapMCSP has a proof system with knowledge complexity O(log n). We complement this result by showing that NP admits an interactive proof system with knowledge complexity Ω(logn) under the existence of an exponentially hard auxiliary-input one-way function (which is a weaker primitive than an exponentially hard one-way function). We also characterize the existence of a robustly-often nonuniformly computable one-way function by the nondeterministic hardness of CZK under the weak assumption that PSPACE ⊈AM. We present two applications of our results. First, we simplify the proof of the recent characterization of a one-way function by NP-hardness of a meta-computational problem and the worst-case hardness of NP given by Hirahara (STOC'23). Second, we show that if NP has a laconic zero-knowledge argument system, then there exists a public-key encryption scheme whose security can be based on the worst-case hardness of NP. This improves previous results which assume the existence of an indistinguishable obfuscation. © 2024 Owner/Author."

Major attention is paid to blockchain applications intended for trading assets that exploit digital cryptographic certificates called tokens. Particularly relevant tokens are the non-fungible tokens (NFTs), namely, unique and non-replicable tokens used to represent the cryptographic counterpart of assets ranging from pieces of art through to licenses and certifications. A relevant consequence of the hard-coded nature of blockchains is the hardness of probing, in particular when advanced searchers involving the capabilities of the smart contracts or the assets digitised by NFTs are required. For this purpose, a formal representation for the operational semantics of smart contracts and of tokens has become particularly urgent, especially in economy and finance, where blockchains become increasingly relevant. Hence, we feel the need to tailor Semantic Web technologies to achieve that semantic representation at least for NFTS. This article reports on an ontology that leverages the Ontology for Agents, Systems, and Integration of Services ('OASIS') towards the semantic representation of smart contracts responsible for managing ERC721-compliant NFTs and running on the Ethereum blockchain. Called Ether-OASIS, the proposed ontology adopts OASIS and tailors its behaviouristic approach to the Ethereum blockchain by conceiving smart contracts as agents running on the blockchain and, consequently, smart contract interactions as agent commitments. Smart contracts are represented in terms of their actions, purposes and tokens that they manage, thus realising a blockchain that is more usable both by users and automated applications. The ontology is evaluated using standard ontological metrics and applied on a case study concerning the minting and transferring of NFTs that digitise batches of wheat.  © 2024 - IOS Press.

Utilizing p-TPD as the guest molecule and various host molecules, we synthesized doped crystals with uniform particle size and afterglow durations ranging from 2.0 s to 4.5 s. Furthermore, leveraging the unique host-guest pairing relationship and facile crystallization characteristics, we developed a “paper-ink” encryption strategy with in situ anti-counterfeiting capabilities.

Similar counterexamples exist for digital signatures and CPA-secure public key encryption (the latter requiring the assumption of a classically CPA-secure encryption scheme). Interestingly, the counterexample does not necessarily extend to the case of other cryptographic objects such as PRGs. - There are unconditional publicly verifiable proofs of quantumness with the minimal rounds of interaction: for uniform adversaries, the proofs are non-interactive, whereas for non-uniform adversaries the proofs are two message public coin. - Our results do not appear to contradict the Aaronson-Ambanis conjecture. Assuming this conjecture, there exist publicly verifiable certifiable randomness, again with the minimal rounds of interaction.

Avoid) and the remote point problem (abbrev.). The upper and lower bounds for these meta problems provide a unified perspective on the complexity of specific explicit construction problems that were previously studied independently. An interesting question largely unaddressed by previous works is whether we can show hardness of Avoid and RPP for simple circuits, such as low-depth circuits. In this paper, we demonstrate, under plausible cryptographic assumptions, that both the range avoidance problem and the remote point problem cannot be efficiently solved by nondeterministic search algorithms, even when the input circuits are as simple as constant-depth circuits. This extends a hardness result established by Ilango, Li, and Williams (STOC'23) against deterministic algorithms employing witness encryption for NP, where the inputs to Avoid are general Boolean circuits. Our primary technical contribution is a novel construction of witness encryption inspired by public-key encryption for certain promise language in NP that is unlikely to be NP-complete. We introduce a generic approach to transform a public-key encryption scheme with particular properties into a witness encryption scheme for a promise language related to the initial public-key encryption scheme. Based on this translation and variants of standard lattice-based or coding-based PKE schemes, we obtain, under plausible assumption, a provably secure witness encryption scheme for some promise language in NP-coNP/poly. Additionally, we show that our constructions of witness encryption are plausibly secure against nondeterministic adversaries under a generalized notion of security in the spirit of Rudich's super-bits (RANDOM'97), which is crucial for demonstrating the hardness of Avoid and RPP against nondeterministic algorithms. © 2024 Owner/Author."

Simultaneously, the encrypted 16-QAM OFDM signal is successfully transmitted over a 1.2 m wireless link, with a data rate of 4 Gbit/s. © 2024 Chinese Optics Letters."

Recently, we have revealed the correlation between Lyapunov exponent and sequence randomness of multidimensional chaotic maps based on modular operation. Since the modular operation can realize the boundedness of chaotic state points, it is important to further reveal the deterministic correlation between Lyapunov exponent and modulus. First, we constructed an n-dimensional nondegenerate hyperchaotic map model with the desired Lyapunov exponents. Then, we gave the existence and uniqueness proof of quadrature rectangle decomposition theorem and revealed the correlation between Lyapunov exponent and modulus. The novelty lies in that (1) in order to realize the irreversibility of the iterative processes of chaotic maps, we constructed a chaotic map based on modular exponentiation, and its inverse function is the discrete logarithm problem; and (2) we reveal for the first time the correlation between Lyapunov exponent and modulus, and give the lower bound of the modulus of the nondegenerate chaotic map. In addition, to verify the effectiveness of the scheme, we constructed four-dimensional and five-dimensional chaotic maps, respectively, and analyzed their dynamical behaviors, and the results revealed that there exist linear or nonlinear correlation between Lyapunov exponent and modulus. © World Scientific Publishing Company."

The authenticators can be external or on-device. They work using challenge-response protocols and public key cryptography. Multiple accounts can be associated with each authenticator. Compared with other forms of authentication, this approach has advantages in security and usability. There are, however, significant limitations which persist. In particular, if users possess only one authenticator, they lack resilience to loss and malfunction. On the other hand, if they possess multiple authenticators, they lack practical solutions to keep authenticators synchronised. In this paper, we present three solutions which combine the usability of a single authenticator with the resilience of multiple authenticators. We also present two key derivation functions which are used in our solutions. All three solutions maintain core security and privacy properties found in existing systems. Meanwhile, each solution provides additional value in different use cases. The security of our solutions is analysed using ProVerif. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

Indeed, there is much yet to understand about the feasibility of quantum obfuscation even in the classical oracle model, where one is given for free the ability to obfuscate any classical circuit. In this work, we develop a new array of techniques that we use to construct a quantum state obfuscator, a powerful notion formalized recently by Coladangelo and Gunn (arXiv:2311.07794) in their pursuit of better software copy-protection schemes. Quantum state obfuscation refers to the task of compiling a quantum program, consisting of a quantum circuit C with a classical description and an auxiliary quantum state ψ, into a functionally-equivalent obfuscated quantum program that hides as much as possible about C and ψ. We prove the security of our obfuscator when applied to any pseudo-deterministic quantum program, i.e. one that computes a (nearly) deterministic classical input / classical output functionality. Our security proof is with respect to an efficient classical oracle, which may be heuristically instantiated using quantum-secure indistinguishability obfuscation for classical circuits. Our result improves upon the recent work of Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa (STOC 2023) who also showed how to obfuscate pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits in the classical oracle model, but only ones with a completely classical description. Furthermore, our result answers a question of Coladangelo and Gunn, who provide a construction of quantum state indistinguishability obfuscation with respect to a quantum oracle, but leave the existence of a concrete real-world candidate as an open problem. Indeed, our quantum state obfuscator together with Coladangelo-Gunn gives the first candidate realization of a ""best-possible""copy-protection scheme for all polynomial-time functionalities. Our techniques deviate significantly from previous works on quantum obfuscation. We develop several novel technical tools which we expect to be broadly useful in quantum cryptography. These tools include a publicly-verifiable, linearly-homomorphic quantum authentication scheme with classically-decodable ZX measurements (which we build from coset states), and a method for compiling any quantum circuit into a ""linear + measurement""() quantum program: an alternating sequence of CNOT operations and partial ZX measurements. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

However, past research has been designed on ideal channel models, disregarding the possibility of ciphertext errors caused by channel interference during actual transmission. This omission poses difficulties in ensuring the reliability of the ciphertext, especially in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) where resources are limited and data accuracy requirements are high. Designing a highly secure and reliable lightweight block cipher for such situations is one of the most challenging tasks. Hence, we propose a lightweight block cipher ECLBC with error detection and correction mechanisms. For security, ECLBC not only achieves a certain security level in fewer rounds but also achieves a mode transition within AND-rotation-XOR (AND-RX) lightweight block ciphers. This transition involves a shift from the Feistel to the substitution-permutation network (SPN) and from half-round key XOR to full-round key XOR. For reliability, ECLBC supports detecting and correcting erroneous ciphertext due to channel interference. Given the resource-constrained nature of IoMT devices, we implement the detection and correction mechanism of ECLBC based on the linear block code. Finally, various classical cryptography methods are employed to analyze the performance and security of the ECLBC.  © 2014 IEEE."

The boom in modern communication technology relies on information exchange on shared and open network space.

The area of information security thus became a popular topic of research among researchers. In this paradigm information security through chaos-based cryptography has been reported widely in recent research work. Owing to the property of ergodicity, pseudo-randomness, non-periodicity, and extreme sensitive to initial condition chaotic maps have been found to be a popular option for data encryption. In this paper a comparative analysis of some recently reported one-dimensional chaotic maps have been done. For this range of bifurcation parameter, maximum value of Lyapunov exponent, and sensitivity to initial condition have been considered as measure for comparison. The bifurcation diagram and Lyapunov exponents of chaotic maps have been simulated on MATLAB R2018b platform. The analysis shows that with time the one-dimensional chaotic maps have been significantly improved in terms of chaotic behaviour. © 2024 Author(s)."

However, ensuring the security and efficiency of computation offloading in multi-access MEC networks remains a critical challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for secure computation offloading in multi-access MEC networks. The proposed framework utilizes DRL agents to dynamically make offloading decisions based on the current network conditions, resource availability, and security requirements. The agents learn optimal offloading policies through interactions with the environment, aiming to maximize task completion efficiency while minimizing security risks. To enhance security, the framework integrates encryption techniques and access control mechanisms to protect sensitive data during offloading. The proposed approach undergoes comprehensive simulations to assess its performance in terms of security, efficiency, and scal-ability. The results demonstrate that the DRL-based approach effectively balances the trade-offs between security and efficiency, achieving robust and adaptive computation offloading in multi-access MEC networks. This study contributes to advancing the state-of-the-art in secure and efficient mobile edge computing systems, fostering the development of intelligent and resilient MEC solutions for future mobile networks. © 2024 by the authors of this article.

However, natural polysaccharides with weak fluorescence are not suitable for anti-counterfeiting. Herein, alginate derivatives (SA-PBA) exhibiting aggregation-induced emission with high-quantum yields were synthesized by grafting phenylboronic acid (PBA) onto a sodium alginate (SA) chain. As the concentration increases, polymer assembly can be induced to form more compact soft colloidal aggregates, which enhances the fluorescence properties of alginate derivatives by introducing B ← N coordination bonds in the hydrophobic microregions. Interestingly, the clustered aggregates of SA-PBA can be dynamically controlled by pH, realizing the reversible adjustment of fluorescence. The corresponding mechanism is revealed by the combination of coarse-grained simulations and experiments. It is found that SA-PBA uses a hydrophobic driving force and hydrogen bond interaction to self-assemble in an aqueous solution and promote fluorescence emission. Moreover, the fluorescence quantum yield of SA-PBA can reach 14.4 % and can be reversibly altered by tuning soft colloidal microstructures. Therefore, a reversible information encryption system of SA-PBA is developed for anti-counterfeiting. This work shed some light on how to design novel anti-counterfeit materials based on natural polysaccharides and optimize the dynamic fluorescence conditions. © 2024"

Our scheme allows for distinguishing, in a scalable manner, different networks consisting of bipartite and multipartite entanglement sources. It can be applied to semi-device-independent scenarios also, where the measurement devices and network nodes are not well characterized and trusted.

Currently, there is a lack of effective technical verification methods for evaluating and certifying green electricity consumption. Moreover, the evaluation process faces technical challenges regarding privacy protection of green electricity consumption data. An evaluation and certification model of green electricity consumption based on privacy computing is proposed. First, a novel homomorphic encryption method is devised to support the privacy protection of multiple parties involved in evaluation of green electricity consumption. In contrast to traditional homomorphic encryption algorithms, this method demonstrates higher efficiency in the encryption and decryption processes, and the procedure of encryption and decryption can be segmented while maintaining full homomorphism. Then, a collaborative privacy computing model of homomorphic encryption and trusted execution environment (TEE) is proposed to solve the problem that the traditional homomorphic encryption algorithm can not support the nonlinear operation in ciphertext, and the calculation and storage cost are high. Finally, based on the verifiability mechanism of the computing process of TEE and the tamper-proof characteristics of blockchain certificate data, a reliability assurance mechanism of green electricity consumption evaluation results is established. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can efficiently compute the evaluation data involving privacy protection for green electricity consumption, which takes approximately 0.114 seconds to complete the green electricity consumption evaluation of privacy protection for 10 000 consumers. © 2024 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.

Previous fruitful works have mainly focused on query models. Driven by various applications, several works by Bauer, Farshim and Mazaheri (CRYPTO 2018), Itsykson and Riazanov (CCC 2021), G'o'os and Jain (RANDOM 2022) independently proposed the communication version of collision problems. In the communication setting, both Alice and Bob receive k random subsets of [N]: S1,...,Sk and T1,...,Tk with each of size roughly √N, where a typical choice of k is in the order of √N for applications. Then Alice and Bob aim to find a pair (x,x′) such that x,x′∈ Si∩ Tj for some Si and Tj. A simple protocol that solves this problem with O(N1/4) communication bits is the following: Alice sends to Bob a random subset of S1 of size N1/4 and Bob checks if there is a set Tj that has more than two intersections to this subset. All the papers mentioned above believe this bound should be tight up to some log factors. In this paper, we prove an ω(N1/4) randomized communication lower bound, affirming the conjecture above. Previously, only an ω(N1/12) was known by a work of G'o'os and Jain (RANDOM 2022). Our lower bound provides direct applications to cryptography and proof complexity via connections by Bauer, Farshim, and Mazaheri (CRYPTO 2018) and Itsykson and Riazanov (CCC 2021). Our proof technique could be of independent interest as it is an extension of simulation methods to non-lifted functions. Previously, simulations have been widely applied to lifted functions (a.k.a composed functions), which leads to beautiful query-to- communication lifting theorems. However, many important communication problems are not lifted functions. We believe our methods could give more applications. In particular, it may have applications to communication complexity of search problems with many solutions. Note that many existing methods do not apply to this setting. © 2024 Owner/Author."

Unfortunately, it is well-known that MPC guaranteeing output delivery to every party is infeasible when a majority of the parties are malicious. In fact, parties operating over a point-to-point network (i.e., without access to a broadcast channel) cannot even reach an agreement on the output when more than one third of the parties are malicious (Lamport, Shostak, and Pease, JACM 1980).Motivated by this infeasibility in the point-to-point model, Gold-wasser and Lindell (J. Cryptol 2005) introduced a definition of MPC that does not require agreement, which today is generally referred to as MPC with selective abort. Under this definition, any party may abort the protocol if they detect malicious behavior. They showed that MPC with selective abort is feasible for any number of malicious parties by implementing a broadcast functionality with abort.While the model of MPC with abort has attracted much attention over the years, little is known about its communication complexity over point-to-point networks. In this work, we study the communication complexity of MPC with abort and devise nearly-optimal communication efficient protocols in this model. Namely, we prove trade-offs between the number of honest parties h, the communication complexity, and the locality of the protocols. Here, locality is a bound on the number of peers with which each party must communicate. Our results are as follows:(1) Near-optimal communication: A protocol with Õ(n2/h) communication complexity.(2) Near-optimal locality: A protocol with Õ(n3/h) communication complexity where each party communicates with only Õ(n/h) other parties.(3) Intermediate communication vs locality: A protocol with communication complexity Õ(n3/h3/2) where each party communicates with only [EQUATION] parties.(4) Lower bound: An ω (n2/h) lower bound on the communication complexity. In particular, we show that any party must communicate with ω(n/h) other parties. Our lower bound is inspired by a recent lower bound for Broadcast by Blum et. al (DISC 2023). © 2024 Association for Computing Machinery. All rights reserved."

Herein, we report a soft double salt assembly strategy that could result in well-organized nanostructures and different luminescence based on multiple weak intermolecular interactions thanks to the existence of electrostatic attraction between the anionic and cationic platinum(II) complexes. The cationic complexes B1 and B2 can coassemble with anionic complex A, respectively, and the emission switches from monomeric and excimeric emission to the triplet metal-metal-to-ligand charge transfer (3MMLCT) along with morphology changes from 0-dimensional (0-D) nanospheres to 3-dimensional (3-D) nanostructures. It is demonstrated that an isodesmic growth mechanism is adopted during the spontaneous self-assembly process, and the relative negative ΔG values make the anionic and cationic complex molecules prefer to form aggregates based on π-π stacking, Pt···Pt interactions, and electrostatic interactions.

However, this security heavily relies on users participating in an authentication ceremony to verify encryption key fingerprints, thwarting potential man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. This authentication ceremony involves comparing QR codes or readable/exchangeable codes (e.g., numeric or hexadecimal) to ensure a match. Failure to match these codes due to human errors or click-through behavior makes users vulnerable to MitM attacks, as recent research highlights users’ inability to perform this crucial comparison task in current E2EE applications. This paper presents an innovative automated approach integrated into the Signal application to simplify the authentication ceremony by automating the safety number comparison task. The new approach streamlines the comparison process by removing the manual burden from users. It prompts users to share the safety number through two out-of-band (OOB) channels: an SMS message and orally during a phone call with the other party. Simultaneously, the approach automatically performs a comparison between the shared safety number and the locally generated safety number on the recipient’s phone. This automated comparison ensures accuracy, reduces human error, and enhances security by making it doubly difficult for attackers, as both channels must be compromised simultaneously. The approach demonstrates improved effectiveness, eliminating human errors and resisting MitM attacks, making it more robust than the current implementation in the Signal application. The results show a 0% false acceptance and 0% false rejection rate, significantly enhancing security and usability in this critical authentication process. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

However, in the dense regime of parameters, where the list contains more numbers and many solutions exist, the complexity of finding one of them can be significantly improved by Wagner's k-tree algorithm. Such algorithms for k-SUM in the dense regime have many applications, notably in cryptanalysis.In this article, assuming the average-case k-SUM conjecture, we prove that known algorithms are essentially optimal for k= 3,4,5. For k> 5, we prove the optimality of the k-tree algorithm for a limited range of parameters. We also prove similar results for k-XOR, where the sum is replaced with exclusive or.Our results are obtained by a self-reduction that, given an instance of k-SUM that has a few solutions, produces from it many instances in the dense regime. We solve each of these instances using the dense k-SUM oracle and hope that a solution to a dense instance also solves the original problem. We deal with potentially malicious oracles (that repeatedly output correlated useless solutions) by an obfuscation process that adds noise to the dense instances. Using discrete Fourier analysis, we show that the obfuscation eliminates correlations among the oracle's solutions, even though its inputs are highly correlated. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

Lightweight block ciphers are pivotal in fortifying the security of IoT systems, yet the resource-constrained nature of IoT often limits the complexity of their designs, especially the linear layer in typical substitution-permutation network (SPN) and Feistel designs. This study investigates the vulnerability of seven lightweight block ciphers - specifically, CRAFT, Midori, SKINNY, MANTIS, LBlock, TWINE, and WARP, each catering to diverse application demands - concerning their susceptibility to mixture differential (MD) cryptanalysis. Modifying an automated tool based on linear programming, we identify MD distinguishers associated with these ciphers, exhibiting a higher number of rounds than that observed in the widely adopted AES block cipher. This disparity suggests that the simplified linear layer adopted by the lightweight block ciphers potentially compromises their resistance to MD distinguisher construction. Nevertheless, this compromise is counterbalanced by an augmented incorporation of rounds within the cipher design. Pertaining to the notion of security margins - denoting the percentage of rounds beyond the scope of constructed MD distinguishers relative to the total number of full rounds - the lightweight block ciphers subjected to scrutiny manifest elevated security margins, thereby demonstrating heightened resilience against MD cryptanalysis. This research provides a comprehensive security evaluation of the target lightweight block ciphers and introduces a versatile evaluation tool that can be adapted for the analysis of other aligned lightweight block ciphers in the context of MD cryptanalysis.  © 2014 IEEE."

This article focuses on enhancing the complexity of chaotic systems by introducing the memristor, a nonlinear component. We propose a novel map called the 2-D memristive Cubic map (2D-MCM), which integrates the memristor with the Cubic map to create a discrete mapping. The 2D-MCM exhibits rich dynamical behavior and a broad parameter space. Notably, the 2D-MCM displays boosting bifurcation behavior. As the control parameters increase, the 2D-MCM demonstrates an expanded range of values, indicating its ability to generate a larger number of pseudo-random sequences. To validate its performance, we establish a hardware platform to physically capture the attractors of the 2D-MCM. To verify the performance of the 2D-MCM in generating pseudorandom sequences, we designed a video encryption algorithm based on the 2D-MCM. This algorithm selectively encrypts specific areas within the video, with correlation coefficients of the encrypted video in the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions being 0.0002, -0.0005, and 0.0004, respectively. Through simulation experiments and security analysis, we demonstrate that the 2D-MCM performs well in video encryption tasks.  © 2014 IEEE."

However, the conventional RTP materials usually exhibit low efficiency and short lifetime in aqueous solution. Herein, an in situ host–guest strategy is proposed to achieve cyanuric acid (CA)-derived phosphorescent carbon nitrogen dots (CNDs) composite (CNDs@CA) that demonstrates a significant enhancement of both quantum yield (QY) and lifetime mediated by water. Detailed investigations reveal that the robust hydrogen bonding networks between CNDs@CA and water effectively stabilize triplet excitons and suppress nonradiative decays, as well as facilitate efficient energy transfer from CA to CNDs, thereby prolonging the lifetime and enhancing the efficiency of RTP. The phosphorescent QY and lifetime of CNDs@CA can be increased to 26.89% (3.9-fold increase) and 951.25 ms (5.5-fold increase), respectively, with the incorporation of 50 wt% water under ambient conditions. Even in fully aqueous environments (with up to 400 wt% water added), CNDs@CA exhibits persistent water-boosted RTP properties, demonstrating exceptional stability.

Quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation are just a few of the miracles they can do when working together. Some of the uses range from assisting in the prevention of spies reading private messages to assisting in the prevention of spies reading private communications. Quantum purification and quantum error correction are examples of techniques that will make their implementation easier. Although some of these concepts are still beyond present technological capabilities, quantum cryptography has been established. The possibilities for small-scale quantum computer device prototypes by the end of the millennium are promising. This paper is focusing on addressing the depended approaches which deal with implementation cryptography based on quantumcomputing. Remembering that cryptography is a method of encryption that uses the naturally occurring propertiesof quantum mechanics to secure and transmit data in a way that cannot be hacked. Cryptography is the process ofencrypting and protecting data so that only the person who has the right secret key can decrypt it. For decades now, quantum computing has been hailed as one of the next big revolutions. Quantum computing is not just fasterthan traditional computing methods, but a fundamentally different approach to solve seemingly intractable problems. The mathematical operations that most traditional cryptographic algorithms rely on could be cracked with a sufficiently strong quantum computer. This paper aims to explain how quantum computing affects currentcryptography and expose readers to fundamental post-quantum methods. Quantum computing's influence on IT professionals is becoming increasingly important. As a result, we provide a straightforward introduction to post-quantum cryptography, including quantum-resistant algorithms and quantum key distribution. © 2024 AIP Publishing LLC."

Leveraging Au- induced luminescence, Zn2+- induced shape memory, and Hg2+- induced fluorescence quenching, our method engendered a suite of distinctive properties, including fluorescence, shape memory effects, and ionic conductivity. Tunable fluorescence was utilized for detecting Hg2+ with a detection limit as low as 0.0007 μmol/L. Additionally, a successful design of a multilevel information encryption platform, ranging from 2D to 3D, was achieved by combining the aforementioned properties. The information written using Hg2+ as ink can be protected by the fixed shape of Zn2+, and the encrypted information can only be read under the conditions of shape recovery and UV irradiation.

Multi-level PUFs boost system complexity, thereby improving system reliability and fault tolerance. However, crosstalk-free multi-level PUFs remain a persistent challenge. In this study, a hierarchical PUF system that harnesses the spontaneous phase separation of silk fibroin /PVA blend and the random distribution of silicon-vacancy diamonds within the blend is presented. The thermodynamic instability of phase separation and inherent unpredictability of diamond dispersion gives rise to intricate random patterns at two distinct scales, enabling time-efficient hierarchical authentication for cryptographic keys. These patterns are complementary yet independent, inherently resistant to replication and damage thus affording robust security and reliability to the proposed system. Furthermore, customized authentication algorithms are constructed: visual PUFs authentication utilizes neural network combined structural similarity index measure, while spectral PUFs authentication employs Hamming distance and cross-correlation bit operation. This hierarchical PUF system attains a high recognition rate without interscale crosstalk. Additionally, the coding capacity is exponentially enhanced using M-ary encoding to reinforce multi-level encryption. Hierarchical PUFs hold significant potential for immediate application, offering unprecedented data protection and cryptographic key authentication capabilities. © 2024 The Authors.

However, the reconstruction of supramolecular network will destroy the programming information imprinted on the original network structure, making it difficult to restore to the original state. Here, a novel intelligent programmable photonic gel composed of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and acrylamide is constructed. The mechanical properties and optical signals of gel can be switched reversibly on demand by reasonably designing the winding and compression between molecular structures. Under this conversion mechanism, the rigid “skeleton” constructed from the CNC chiral structure perfectly acts as the coding substrate. Importantly, even after multiple dynamic switching of the supramolecular network, the encoded information can be displayed completely and accurately on the CNC chiral structure in the stretched state. In addition, the 5D controllable conversion of stiffness, transparency, stretchability, color, and shape greatly improves the security and confidentiality of the encoded information inside the gel. This is a successful example of the application of CNC chiral structure in switchable supramolecular network materials.

Along with the ever-emerging new attack paradigms like gradient leakage and model poisoning, the reliability of FFL also obtains lots of research attention. Either UAV nodes or FFL aggregators could be untrusted adversaries. Although multiple security mechanisms involving encryption, obfuscation, Byzantine-robustness, and detection have been proposed, concrete to UAV networks, the majority of existing solutions are unfeasible due to high heterogeneity and limited resources among participants. Hence, in this article, we propose mutually reliable FFL (MR-FFL), a stratified community-based framework to facilitate privacy protection (FFL aggregator's reliability) and poisoning elimination (client nodes' reliability) jointly for FFL in heterogeneous UAV networks. We first divide UAV nodes into both peer communities (PCs) and colleague communities (CCs) according to cross-participant similarity and task-oriented fitness, respectively. Thus, the arbitrarily settled learning tasks following fair principles can be efficiently completed by fine-tuned CCs, even in the presence of a large degree of heterogeneity among PCs. Then, we integrate community-specific differential privacy into the MR-FFL process, to achieve privacy amplification as well as efficient and personal collaborative training at the same time. More importantly, we proposed a community-based credit evaluation to resist poisoning attacks in heterogeneous environments. The results on several standard data sets also highlight the performance of MR-Fed in terms of fairness, accuracy, and integrity jointly.  © 2014 IEEE."

We employ a Zero-Shot (0S) approach utilizing GPT-3.5-turbo, enhanced by employing a meticulously crafted prompt. The approach is implemented in a prototype tool, tailored for the textual GRL (TGRL) language. We evaluate the approach and tool using a GRL model describing the objectives of a Virtual Interior Designer application along with a set of 42 requirements addressing both security and non-security aspects. The approach and tool yielded positive results, demonstrating a precision of 100%, a recall of 78.5%, and an F1-score of 87.9%. © 2024 ACM."

However, the development of optical storage technology based on optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) encounter the serious problems, of single storage mode and easily decoding. In this study, a series of Ba2SiO4 (denoted as BS): Eu2+, Ln3+ (Ln = Dy, Ho) phosphors with adjustable trap distributions (trap depths of 0.6–0.8 eV) have been developed by high-temperature solid-phase method and exhibit intense green emission peak located at 504 nm under excitation of 360 nm. Typically, BS: 0.02Eu2+, 0.02Ho3+ phosphor owns a shallow trap depth of 0.696 eV and BS: 0.02Eu2+, 0.02Dy3+ phosphor shows a deep trap depth of 0.81 eV. Interestingly, the flexible optical information storage film prepared by BS: 0.02Eu2+, 0.02Ho3+ phosphor through spin-coating technique can storage the “National Water Conservation Logo” pattern under NUV irradiation and reappear even after more than 60 days at 75 °C. Subsequently, multimodal anti-counterfeiting strategy is proposed by BS: Eu2+, Ln3+ (Ln = Dy, Ho) phosphors with adjustable trap depths and the flexible information coding device with high transmittance has been developed, in which encrypted message of “HELLO” and “86068” can be recognized at 75 °C and 130 °C, respectively.

PPP is one of the ""original five""syntactically-defined subclasses of TFNP, and has been extensively studied due to the strong connections between its defining problem - the pigeonhole principle - and problems in cryptography, extremal combinatorics, proof complexity, and other fields. However, despite its importance, PPP appears to be less robust than the other important TFNP subclasses. In particular, unlike all other major TFNP subclasses, it was conjectured by Buss and Johnson that PPP is not closed under Turing reductions, and they called for a black-box separation in order to provide evidence for this conjecture. The question of whether PPP contains its Turing closure was further highlighted by Daskalakis in his recent IMU Abacus Medal Lecture. In this work we prove that PPP is indeed not Turing-closed in the black-box setting, affirmatively resolving the above conjecture and providing strong evidence that PPP is not Turing-closed. In fact, we are able to separate PPP from its non-adaptive Turing closure, in which all calls to the Pigeon oracle must be made in parallel. This differentiates PPP from all other important TFNP subclasses, and especially from its closely-related subclass PWPP - defined by reducibility to the weak pigeonhole principle - which is known to be non-adaptively Turing-closed. Our proof requires developing new tools for PPP lower bounds, and creates new connections between PPP and the theory of pseudoexpectation operators used for Sherali-Adams and Sum-of-Squares lower bounds. In particular, we introduce a new type of pseudoexpectation operator that is precisely tailored for lower bounds against black-box PPP, which may be of independent interest. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

In this work, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) was employed as the raw material to synthesize carbon quantum dots (denoted as CQDs-1) by a hydrothermal method. The resulting CQDs-1 inherited C═O groups and N atoms from DTPA, which promoted the formation of triplet excitons under light excitation. On this basis, the CQDs-1 were dispersed in a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix to prepare CQDs-1-PVA composites that exhibited an optimal emission peak at ∼466 nm and emitted the visible afterglow lasting for 8 s. Moreover, tartaric acid (TA) was combined with DTPA as the raw material to synthesize CQDs-2, which induced the formation of π-π conjugated areas in CQDs. As a result, the emission wavelength was slightly red-shifted, and the duration time of afterglow of the CQDs-2-PVA composite was increased to 9 s. Due to the ultralong-lifetime RTP properties of the CQDs-based composites, their applications in the fields of information encryption and anticounterfeiting have also been investigated.

The emission color of afterglow CDs can be regulated by external factors such as excitation wavelength, temperature, and time, which is highly significant for expanding the diversified applications to make them available for biotechnology and information applications. This review summarizes the research progress of multicolor afterglow CDs in recent years, including luminescence regulation strategies, preparation methods, and applications. First, the multicolor afterglow CDs are classified into three strategies: multicolor room temperature phosphorescence (RTP), thermally activated delayed fluorescence converted to RTP, and delayed fluorescence based on Förster resonance energy transfer, and the strategies for regulating their luminescence properties are analyzed. Second, the preparation methods of achieving multicolor afterglow CDs are summarized in both matrix-free and matrix-confined aspects. Then, applications in anticounterfeiting and information encryption, sensing and bioimaging are introduced in detail. Finally, the future challenges and opportunities of multicolor afterglow CDs are prospected to provide ideas for their controlled design and wide application. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

However, efficient DSSE schemes leak some sensitive information to the server. Recent works have implemented forward and backward privacy as security properties to reduce the amount of information leaked during update operations. Many attacks have shown that leakage from search operations can be abused to compromise the privacy of client queries. However, the attack literature has not rigorously investigated techniques to abuse update leakage. In this work, we investigate update leakage under DSSE schemes with forward and backward privacy from the perspective of a passive adversary. We propose two attacks based on a maximum likelihood estimation approach, the UFID Attack and the UF Attack, which target forward-private DSSE schemes with no backward privacy and Level II backward privacy, respectively. These are the first attacks to show that it is possible to leverage the frequency and contents of updates to recover client queries. We propose a variant of each attack which allows the update leakage to be combined with search pattern leakage to achieve higher accuracy. We evaluate our attacks against a real-world dataset and show that using update leakage can improve the accuracy of attacks against DSSE schemes, especially those without backward privacy. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

This is a central cryptographic problem whose computational hardness underpins many widely deployed schemes such as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. We prove that any generic preprocessing DDH algorithm (operating in any cyclic group) achieves advantage at most O(ST2/N). This bound matches the best known attack up to poly-log factors, and confirms that DDH is as secure as the (seemingly harder) discrete logarithm problem against preprocessing attacks. Our result resolves an open question by Corrigan-Gibbs and Kogan (EUROCRYPT 2018), which proved optimal bounds for many variants of discrete logarithm problems except DDH (with an O(√ST2/N) bound). We obtain our results by adopting and refining the approach by Gravin, Guo, Kwok, Lu (SODA 2021) and by Yun (EUROCRYPT 2015). Along the way, we significantly simplified and extended above techniques which may be of independent interests. The highlights of our techniques are following: 1. We obtain a simpler reduction from decisional problems against S-bit advice to their S-wise XOR lemmas against zero-advice, recovering the reduction by Gravin, Guo, Kwok and Lu (SODA 2021). 2. We show how to reduce generic hardness of decisional problems to their variants in the simpler hyperplane model proposed by Yun (EUROCRYPT 2015). This is the first work analyzing a decisional problem in Yun's model, answering an open problem proposed by Auerbach, Hoffman, and Pascual-Perez (TCC 2023). 3. We prove an S-wise XOR lemma of DDH in Yun's model. As a corollary, we obtain the generic hardness of the S-XOR DDH problem. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

This structure, particularly cyber components and networks, makes it susceptible to malicious attacks. One of the solutions to this CPS security issue is to employ end-to-end homomorphic encryption (HE) that allows direct computations on encrypted data. Despite its promise, HE only supports basic operations, such as addition and multiplication, which limits its application areas. Numerical methods have been presented to perform a comparison operation in the HE domain. However, they suffer from a slow processing speed due to an inherently high number of iterations. To accelerate a homomorphic comparison operation, this paper introduces a novel approach that scales inputs using an asymmetric input range in thresholding. Additionally, parallelism in HE-based multilevel thresholding is explored and exploited through the use of a parallel processing application programming interface for further acceleration. Compared to a previous comparison operation method, the proposed method achieves comparable accuracy with fewer iterations, resulting in a 48% reduction in execution time on an edge computing device. Furthermore, employing an additional thread using parallelism increases this reduction to 63%. © 2024 Owner/Author."

Plausibly deniable encryption (PDE) stands out as a pivotal solution, particularly in jurisdictions marked by rigorous regulations or increased vulnerabilities of personal data. However, the existing PDE systems for mobile platforms have evident limitations. These include vulnerabilities to multi-snapshot attacks over RAM and flash memory, an undue dependence on non-secure operating systems, traceable PDE entry point, and a conspicuous PDE application prone to reverse engineering. To address these limitations, we have introduced FSPDE, the first Full-Stack mobile PDE system design which can mitigate PDE compromises present at both the execution and the storage layers of mobile stack as well as the cross-layer communication. Utilizing the resilient security features of ARM TrustZone and collaborating multiple storage sub-layers (block device, flash translation layer, etc.), FSPDE offers a suite of improvements. At the heart of our design, the MUTE and MIST protocols serve both as fortifications against emerging threats and as tools to mask sensitive data, including the PDE access point. A real-world prototype of FSPDE was developed using OP-TEE, a leading open-source Trusted Execution Environment, in tandem with an open-sourced NAND flash controller. Security analysis and experimental evaluations justify both the security and the practicality of our design. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

In this work, we do not focus on solving LWE but on the task of sampling instances. As these are extremely sparse in their range, it may seem plausible that the only way to proceed is to first create s and e and then set b = As+e. In particular, such an instance sampler knows the solution. This raises the question whether it is possible to obliviously sample (A, As+e), namely, without knowing the underlying s. A variant of the assumption that oblivious LWE sampling is hard has been used in a series of works to analyze the security of candidate constructions of Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (SNARKs). As the assumption is related to LWE, these SNARKs have been conjectured to be secure in the presence of quantum adversaries. Our main result is a quantum polynomial-time algorithm that samples well-distributed LWE instances while provably not knowing the solution, under the assumption that LWE is hard. Moreover, the approach works for a vast range of LWE parametrizations, including those used in the above-mentioned SNARKs. This invalidates the assumptions used in their security analyses, although it does not yield attacks against the constructions themselves. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

However, the performance overhead of bilinear map encryption, and in particular that of the pairing operation, which is the predominant operation on bilinear maps, is still quite high. In this paper, we investigate in-depth the sequence of steps required to compute bilinear map pairings, and we identify the performance footprint of each step. We devise an implementation based on FPGA which reduces the overhead of bilinear pairings, in terms of both execution time and resource utilization (i.e., lookup tables and flip-flop units required). Our extensive performance evaluation shows that the proposed approach significantly outperforms benchmarks, and represents an important step towards the wide-scale deployment of bilinear map-based encryption protocol for large-scale applications. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

Because this matter is either electromagnetically invisible (i.e., dark) or too diffuse to image in emission, tests of this cosmic web paradigm are limited. Wide-field surveys do reveal web-like structures in the galaxy distribution, but these luminous galaxies represent less than 10% of baryonic matter. Statistics of absorption by the intergalactic medium (IGM) via spectroscopy of distant quasars support the model yet have not conclusively tied the diffuse IGM to the web. Here, we report on a new method inspired by the Physarum polycephalum slime mold that is able to infer the density field of the cosmic web from galaxy surveys. Applying our technique to galaxy and absorption-line surveys of the local universe, we demonstrate that the bulk of the IGM indeed resides in the cosmic web. From the outskirts of cosmic web filaments, at approximately the cosmic mean matter density (ρ m) and 5 virial radii from nearby galaxies, we detect an increasing H i absorption signature toward higher densities and the circumgalactic medium, to 200ρ m. However, the absorption is suppressed within the densest environments, suggesting shock-heating and ionization deep within filaments and/or feedback processes within galaxies. © 2020.

Turtle ants form a routing backbone of foraging trails linking several nests and temporary food sources. This species travels only in the trees, so their foraging trails are constrained to lie on a natural graph formed by overlapping branches and vines in the tangled canopy. Links between branches, however, can be ephemeral, easily destroyed by wind, rain, or animal movements. Here we report a biologically feasible distributed algorithm, parameterized using field data, that can plausibly describe how turtle ants maintain the routing backbone and find alternative paths to circumvent broken links in the backbone. We validate the ability of this probabilistic algorithm to circumvent simulated breaks in synthetic and real-world networks, and we derive an analytic explanation for why certain features are crucial to improve the algorithm's success. Our proposed algorithm uses fewer computational resources than common distributed graph search algorithms, and thus may be useful in other domains, such as for swarm computing or for coordinating molecular robots. © 2018 The Author(s)."

Owing to their unique characteristics, they are usable in a number of industrial applications, including the manufacture of solar panels and glass. In particular, they can be used for the separation of oil and water, which is highly relevant to petroleum technologies. Self-cleaning surfaces help to reduce the time and cost of keeping equipment clean while enhancing its durability, and they can be broadly categorized into hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. On hydrophilic surfaces, water spreads considerably (sheeting of water), and therefore, it can transport contaminants and leave a clean surface. However, a hydrophobic surface is cleaned by the slipping of water droplets on it. Currently, water-repellent surfaces are used more widely in self-cleaning technologies. The selection and design of such surfaces require a thorough understanding of the underlying physical chemistry of the relevant process.
