The conjecture states that the accuracy cannot increase if the states in M are merged with respect to an equivalence relation ∼ so that the result is a smaller automaton M∼. Put differently, merging states can never improve predictions. This is under the assumption that both M and M∼ are bottom-up deterministic and accept every tree in C. We prove that the conjecture holds, using a construction that turns any probabilistic version N∼ of M∼ into a probabilistic version N of M, such that N assigns at least as great a weight to each tree in C as N∼ does. © 2024 The Author(s)"

However, the field continues to investigate methods of determining how students might overcome obstacles to reach new outcomes. This article documents an exploration within the TRansforming Instruction in Undergraduate Mathematics via Primary Historical Sources (TRIUMPHS) project that combined transgressions theory and situated learning theory, thereby illuminating three components of the former—boundaries, transgressive actions, and outcomes. In this regard, we capture students’ Primary Source Project (PSP) learning experiences in Abstract Algebra courses and bring attention to the challenges in delineating these elements due to drawing upon data not initially collected with transgressions or situated learning theory in mind. Despite this limitation, we underscore the potential of utilizing the transgressions framework in the analysis of students’ unorthodox learning experiences, such as with PSPs, and provide insights for future studies in the field. © The Author(s) & Dept. of Mathematical Sciences-The University of Montana"

This method uses various methods, including qualitative and quantitative techniques, and thoroughly examines the literature. The design and development of this chemistry module using design thinking to empower students' innovation competencies are described in this article. The main challenge for the teaching implementation process that is capable of mastering the skills of generating new ideas and solving problems in the real world is preparing teaching materials, consuming time, and putting pressure on the teacher. Teachers need more support resources to translate the expected teaching practices. This effort aims to generate a new perspective in education, especially chemistry education, in developing student innovation competence in secondary schools in Malaysia. Therefore, this study aims to discuss the design and development research (DDR) approach used to develop a design thinking chemistry module using a DDR approach. The researcher will go through three study phases and use several different research approaches in each phase. In the first phase, the researcher investigated the teachers' needs in their pedagogy used in teaching and students' innovation competencies. The second phase is the design and development phase, involving the consensus of twelve experts in various fields, such as chemistry/science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), curriculum development, module construction experts, and research and innovation planning experts. Consequently, the final phase is implementation and evaluation, focusing on determining the module's effectiveness in teaching and learning. Expert consensus is the primary input in developing modules in Malaysian chemistry education. Malaysian education needs to bring a different educational paradigm and teaching strategy, which includes the impact of teacher pedagogy through design thinking in the future. The conclusion of this article proposes a conceptual framework for the research to contribute to the advancement of design thinking and chemistry education. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Additionally, a neural network approach is also presented for solving eigenvalue problems to analyze solution linear stability, focusing on identifying the largest eigenvalue. The effectiveness of the proposed neural network is examined through experiments on the Bratu equation and the Burgers equation. Results from a finite difference method are also presented as comparison. Varying numbers of grid points are employed in each case to assess the behavior and accuracy of both the neural network and the finite difference method.

However, how HSIs serve STEM students is not well understood. Accordingly, guided by Garcia et al. (Review of Educational Research 89:5–745, 2019) multidimensional servingness framework, we conducted a systematic review of the research on STEM education within the HSI context. By attending to STEM education in conversations around how HSIs may serve Latinx students and their campus communities, our ultimate aim is to improve STEM education particularly at HSIs and advance STEM servingness more broadly. Results, main findings: Through our systematic review of STEM education research at HSIs, we identified (under)studied components of servingness and gaps within this literature base. Specifically, among the 128 qualifying articles, nearly two-thirds focused on student outcomes but overlooked institutions’ organizational context, raising questions about the effect(iveness) of the studied interventions. Additionally, we identified three thematic gaps in this literature: ghosting the HSI context (i.e., relying on HSIs as research sites without considering the unique HSI context); ghosting Latinx culture (i.e., decentering Latinx students and the Latinx community’s sociocultural aspects and assets), and ghosting people and places (i.e., under-examining certain student populations like Latino men in STEM and places like Hispanic-serving community colleges). Ultimately, our study extends the field’s understanding of servingness by attending to STEM education within the context of HSI institutions. Conclusions, brief summary, and potential implications: By systematically reviewing studies on STEM education at HSIs, we identified (under)studied components of servingness and patterned gaps within this literature. In doing so, we highlight opportunities to advance STEM servingness at HSIs through future research, policy, and practice. Collectively, these avenues hold the promise of improving STEM education and diversifying the STEM workforce. © The Author(s) 2024."

Liu and Li characterized a connected graph with a perfect matching with respect to the distance signless Laplacian spectral radius (Liu and Li, 2021). Win characterized a connected graph with a spanning k-tree via the number of connected components (Win, 1989). Motivated by Liu and Li's and Win's results, in this paper we investigate the relations between the spanning k-tree and the distance signless Laplacian spectral radius in a connected graph and prove an upper bound for η1(G) in a connected graph G to guarantee the existence of a spanning k-tree. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Though many protection mechanisms are provided, they have been proved easy to bypass, and the existed detection methods show poor performance when facing malicious documents with unknown vulnerabilities or with few malicious behaviors. In this paper, we first introduce the definition of im-documents, to describe those vulnerable documents which show implicitly malicious behaviors and escape most of public antivirus engines. Then we present GLDOC—a GCN based framework that is aimed at effectively detecting im-documents with dynamic analysis, and improving the possible blind spots of past detection methods. Besides the system call which is the only focus in most researches, we capture all dynamic behaviors in sandbox, take the process tree into consideration and reconstruct both of them into graphs. Using each line to learn each graph, GLDOC trains a 2-channel network as well as a classifier to formulate the malicious document detection problem into a graph learning and classification problem. Experiments show that GLDOC has a comprehensive balance of accuracy rate and false alarm rate − 95.33% and 4.33% respectively, outperforming other detection methods. When further testing in a simulated 5-day attacking scenario, our proposed framework still maintains a stable and high detection accuracy on the unknown vulnerabilities. © The Author(s) 2024."

We establish conditions under which the disease-free equilibrium of the model demonstrates local or global asymptotic stability, contingent on the efficacy of quarantine measures. Notably, we find that a strain with a quarantine reproduction number greater than 1 will out-compete a strain with a quarantine reproduction number less than 1, leading to its extinction under complete immunity conditions. Additionally, we identify scenarios where diseases persist in a sub-critical coexistence endemic equilibrium, despite one control reproduction number being below one. Our exploration of backward bifurcation reveals the model's capacity to accommodate the coexistence of the disease-free equilibrium with up to four endemic equilibria. Moreover, we demonstrate that the existence of cross-immunity enhances the coexistence of two strains. However, co-infections and imperfect quarantine measures pose significant challenges in containing outbreaks, sustaining the outbreak potential even with successful control of individual virus strains. Conversely, controlling outbreaks becomes more manageable in the absence of co-infections, especially with perfect quarantine measures. We conclude by advocating for public health strategies that address the complexities posed by co-infections, emphasizing the importance of simultaneously tackling multiple pathogens. © 2024 The Author(s)"

With linear chromatic dispersion and linear temporal evolution, the variational principle recovered the dynamical system of soliton parameters. Two specific forms of optical solitons are addressed in the paper which are super—Gaussian and super—sech pulses. These typically model RZ and NRZ types of pulses considered in telecommunications engineering. The special cases are naturally revealed when the parameter dictating the generalized nonlinearity is set to unity. The issue of soliton radiation has been tacitly disregarded to keep mathematics simple. The perturbation terms are also taken into account and the extended version of the Euler—Lagrange’s equation displays the extended dynamical system of these soliton parameters. The results naturally involved a range of special functions. © The Author(’s)."

One approach was for PSTs to teach each other, video-record their teaching, and code types of questions asked by the teachers. For a mathematics practicum, PSTs coded questions in two broad categories with four question types: lower-order questions that elicited (a) yes/no response or (b) one-word/short-answer responses; and higher-order questions that prompted students to (c) explain a mathematical concept or their chosen strategy and (d) give reasons for their strategy choice. This mixed-methods study examined data from PSTs’ coding of their peers’ questions posed during fourth-grade mathematics lessons, comparing it with the teacher educator’s coding of the same questions. In addition, PSTs’ lesson reflections served as a data source for triangulation as well as a means to analyze PSTs’ learning from this task. The results indicated that PSTs coded questions more often as higher order than the teacher educator. The findings also revealed the PSTs’ tendency to ask lower-order questions to gather recall or procedural information from students more than higher-order questions that probed students for an explanation or justification of their chosen strategies to solve a problem. Furthermore, the PSTs’ reflections on the coding task showed that PSTs were not only surprised that so many posed questions were lower-order, but also felt that coding questions increased their awareness of question quality. Recommendations suggest approaches that can be incorporated into teacher education programs to develop PSTs’ questioning skills. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks. All rights reserved."

The optimization methodology is based on the modified version of Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (MMRFO) technique for minimizing the sum of squared errors (SSE) between the Experimentally measured stack voltage and the estimated voltage produced by the optimized model. In the modified methodology, the sine-cosine method has been utilized to enhance the global searching capability in the exploration phase and the local searching capability in the exploitation phase of the MRFO algorithm. In order to validate the effectiveness of the suggested methodology, four different case studies comprising standard benchmark 250 W PEMFC, BCS-500 W PEMFC, SR-12 500 W FC, and 1 kW Temasek stacks were utilized, and the attainments have been compared with the measured polarization characteristics. The attainments have been intensively compared with several metaheuristic algorithms (MA) including Tree growth Algorithm (TGA), Grey wolf optimizer (GWO), Whale optimization algorithm (WOA), Salp swarm algorithm (SSA), and original Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO), to confirm the superiority of the MMRFO against the compared techniques. The obtained results give a satisfactory agreement between the MMRFO-based model and the experimentally measured data. Finally, the achievements confirmed the effectiveness of the MMRFO over the basic MRFO algorithm and other novel metaheuristic algorithms in identifying PEMFC parameters. © 2024 The Authors"

Therefore, even though counting is an important first strategy for young children, it is vital to support the development of CC with NC strategies from the earliest stages of mathematics education. This study examined the success of an intervention to promote the use of CC and NC strategies and conceptual subitizing (CS). The study was conducted with a sample of N = 1017 Grade 1 students, and investigated whether the achievement gain was affected by the intervention setting: cooperative learning, individual support for low achievers, a combination of the two settings, and a control group. Students in the combined setting had greater achievement gains in CC with NC strategy use and CS than the control group and outperformed those in the other intervention groups in CS. The combined setting also benefitted low achievers in mathematics for CS, but not for CC and strategy use. A combination of cooperative learning and individual support seems to be the best option for improving the CS and CC and NC strategy use of first graders, especially low achievers in mathematics. © The Author(s) 2024."

In order to certify the superiority of these algorithms, standardized comparisons among them and against other physics-based algorithms are necessary. In this work, for Max-Cut problems up to 20,000 nodes, we benchmark QAIA against quantum annealing and other physics-based algorithms. We found that ballistic simulated bifurcation excelled for chimera and small-scale graphs, achieving nearly a 50-fold reduction in time-to-solution compared to quantum annealing. For large-scale graphs, discrete simulated bifurcation achieves the lowest time-to-target and outperforms D-Wave Advantage system when tasked with finding the maximum cut value in pegasus graphs.

To this end, an analytical framework of instrumental orchestrations within a GeoGebra environment was established. Data were collected from Chinese preservice mathematics teachers, including the videotapes of their simulated lessons, GeoGebra files, written documents, self-reflections, online speaking, etc. In the results, three participants’ changes in instrumental orchestrations were presented as main cases. It was found that the three preservice mathematics teachers’ types of instrumental orchestrations did not change, but the frequencies of those increased significantly. The changes in didactical configurations were mainly reflected in the layout of GeoGebra, and the changes in exploitation modes were mainly manifested in the techniques teachers use and the management of mathematics tasks. In addition, it was revealed that theoretical support (instrumental approach), technical support (knowledge about using GeoGebra), and community support (“Same Content Different Designs” activity and communicating and discussing with others) were useful course elements inviting changes in instrumental orchestrations.

Firstly, this scheme utilizes the designed Ball-PB tree structure to partition the dataset into multiple subsets. Considering the efficiency and confidentiality of inner-product queries on the tree, the scheme represents the internal nodes and leaf nodes accordingly and defines a secure inner-product calculation protocol, EncInp.

After 75 years of development, holographic imaging has become a powerful tool for optical wavefront measurement and quantitative phase imaging. The emergence of this technology has given fresh energy to physics, biology, and materials science. Digital holography (DH) possesses the quantitative advantages of wide-field, non-contact, precise, and dynamic measurement capability for complex-waves. DH has unique capabilities for the propagation of optical fields by measuring light scattering with phase information. It offers quantitative visualization of the refractive index and thickness distribution of weak absorption samples, which plays a vital role in the pathophysiology of various diseases and the characterization of various materials. It provides a possibility to bridge the gap between the imaging and scattering disciplines. The propagation of wavefront is described by the complex amplitude. The complex-value in the complex-domain is reconstructed from the intensity-value measurement by camera in the real-domain. Here, we regard the process of holographic recording and reconstruction as a transformation between complex-domain and real-domain, and discuss the mathematics and physical principles of reconstruction. We review the DH in underlying principles, technical approaches, and the breadth of applications. We conclude with emerging challenges and opportunities based on combining holographic imaging with other methodologies that expand the scope and utility of holographic imaging even further.

However, students’ creativity assessment is challenging. Grounded on the paradigm that creativity is a tangible parameter, this study aims to explore students’ creative thinking skill via a reading-based creativity test. The test was developed by considering the creativity indicators defined by Paul Torrance, i.e., fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration. In this creativity test, the reading and the questions were designed to make students integrate their science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) knowledge. Based on the empirical validation, the creativity test had a reliability of 0.897, indicating that the test was reliable to measure students’ creativity. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the test was conducted online to 108 junior high school students in East Java, Indonesia. In general, the students achieved the highest level of creativity in terms of originality that gained average score of 3.63 (with scale 4.00). Meanwhile, they underperformed on the aspects of elaboration having average score of 2.40. There were 93 and 79 students who responded very well on the originality and fluency aspects, respectively. In contrast, respectively over 30% and 50% of students showed a lack of creativity on the aspect of flexibility and elaboration. These creativity assessment data are beneficial for educational stakeholders especially to increase the quality of teaching and learning related to STEAM education. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

However, the existing anonymization techniques often suffer lower execution efficiency and unnecessary information loss when dealing with complex data. Therefore, we propose a dynamic anonymity privacy-preserving model based on hierarchical sequential three-way decisions. Specifically, we first divide the data into multiple granularity spaces by attributes and dynamically process the data in the granularity spaces. Then, in a single granularity space, we construct a generalization hierarchy for the data based on the attributes generalization trees and divide it into the positive, negative and boundary regions based on anonymous parameter. Next, we can acquire the positive and boundary regions by generalization and dynamically update the processed data at the next granularity. After that, we suppress the data in the final negative and boundary regions while releasing the positive region. To further improve data availability, we combine the idea of differential privacy by adding noise data to the final boundary region enabling its release and propose an enhanced anonymity model. Finally, we compare our proposed algorithms with other methods on six datasets. Experimental results show that our method effectively reduces processing costs, improves data usability and protects data privacy. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Therefore, this correlational study aims to assess the relationship between self-regulated learning and academic buoyancy in the context of mathematics learning. Using a sample of 463 secondary school students from FELDA area (southern and east coast area), data were collected from Academic Buoyancy Scale and Self-regulated Learning Questionnaire. Results showed that, overall students’ self-regulated learning was positively and significantly correlated with academic buoyancy (r=.696**). Besides, academic buoyancy was also positively correlated with all three phases of self-regulated learning namely forethought (r=.634**), performance (r=.535**) and reflection (r=.622**) phase. The findings of the study offer insights into the importance of having good selfregulated learning skills to be the protective factor in dealing with daily academic challenges in the mathematics learning setting. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

However, MAR applications are computationally intensive, leading to high energy consumption and latency issues. To address these challenges, this research presents a Hybrid Monte Carlo Tree Search (HMCTS) based task offloading scheme, combining a genetic algorithm with Monte Carlo tree search for efficient task management. The proposed method uses YoloV7 for object recognition and aims to reduce energy consumption, response time, and migration time. Experimental results demonstrate that the HMCTS approach significantly reduces energy consumption to 1290 kJ, response time to 24 ms, and migration time to 0.52 ms, outperforming existing techniques. These improvements highlight the potential of the HMCTS method for enhancing the performance of MAR applications. Proposed hybrid approach aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of task offloading in MAR applications. The HMCTS model dynamically offloads tasks to edge servers, optimizing scheduling time, response time, and energy consumption. © 2024 The Authors"

The framework of expectancy-value theory has been used widely in primary and secondary education and partly in tertiary education to assess the self-beliefs of students in terms of expectancy of success and perceived value of mathematics. Based on this framework, we measured how the intrinsic value, the attainment value, the utility value, and the cost of learning mathematics as well as the expectancy of success when learning mathematics developed during the secondary–tertiary transition of students into STEM fields. Data were collected in a quantitative repeated-measures questionnaire study with two measurement points (measurement point 1: n = 710, measurement point 2: n = 487, listwise: n = 409). We conducted a latent profile analysis to identify the prevalent patterns of mathematics self-beliefs, called profiles, at each of the two measurement points. We studied the relation of these profiles to prior education, achievement at school, and achievement at university. By performing a latent transition analysis, we determined the probabilities of transitioning from the initial profiles to the posterior profiles. Results: Our analysis revealed four distinct prevalent profiles at each measurement point, ranging from highly favorable (i.e., high expectancy, high value, low cost) to highly unfavorable with respect to learning mathematics. The profiles with favorable manifestations remained stable over time, while those with undesirable manifestations deteriorated further. We observed a sharp increase in cost across all profiles. Prior achievement correlated strongly with profile membership. Conclusions: The expenditure of time and energy increased sharply during the secondary–tertiary transition, independently of the students’ initial motivational patterns. The perceived utility of mathematics for potential future careers was shown to be a significant source of motivation. The role of mathematics in future careers should thus be made visible in university teaching. Keeping the detrimental development of initially undesirable motivational profiles in mind, university teachers should create ample opportunities for students to gain a sense of accomplishment. © The Author(s) 2024."

Hepatocyte apoptosis casts extensive impact in regulating chronic HCV infection. We propose a four dimensional deterministic model scheming the role of hepatocyte apoptosis and significance of HCV-specific CTL response in the intermediate stages of chronic HCV infection. Numerical simulation indicates that unregulated behavior of hepatocyte apoptosis triggers hepatocellular carcinoma and prolonged continuation of apoptosis induces liver damages. The system undergoes backward bifurcation and the value of the basic reproduction number R0=0.98<1 shows recurrence of infection. Local sensitivity analysis has been performed to reveal the most sensitive parameters responsible for the progression and mitigation of infection. In order to control of chronic HCV infection through pan-genotypic direct acting antiviral drugs (DAAs), impulsive differential equations are considered to study the effect of perfect drug adherence to both fixed and non-fixed dosing. For possible eradication of the chronic HCV infection, impulsive drug control suggests significant viral load reduction. The analytical results obtained for both non-impulsive and impulsive models are quantified biologically. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

However, the Newcomb–Benford law (NBL), also known as the first-digit law or Benford's law, reveals a completely different fact: the distributions follows a logarithm-type law. This bias in the frequency of occurrence of the leading digits of numbers is evident in everything from the lengths of rivers, the areas of countries, stock prices, and population numbers. Omnipresence of NBL emerges in mathematics (the Fibonacci sequence, the distribution of prime numbers, etc.) and also in the field of physics (i.e. the half-lives of unstable nuclei). From the earliest years, a large bibliography has been developed and applied to many fields such as fraud detection in finances, international trade and election results analysis. Usually, the diagnosis of such works is reduced to a qualitative binary assessment (conformity or non-conformity). The present paper aims to establish a supervised methodology to address existing gaps and enhance the reliability of final decisions. These gaps include uncertainty about the minimum data volume required to validate Benford's Law, the low sensitivity of current metrics (Euclidean distance or Mean Absolute Difference) to detect minor levels of adulteration, and the need to quantify both the level and nature of adulteration. Two new procedures have been established coming from Signal Analysis and Processing theory. The first relates the deconvolution between the empirical leading digit distribution and the Benford one. The second procedure consists of obtaining the generating functions (via Hilbert and Fourier transforms) to increase the contrast between both functions: the empirical under research and Benford's as the reference. Based on calibrated datasets, we are able to quantify the magnitude of accidental errors or malicious fraud adulteration and make the discrimination between both. Finally, as benchmark, fifteen real-world datasets were studied. This study shows that most of datasets are suspicious of Fraud. Notably, in the field of human health, several datasets demonstrate significant fraudulent deviations, defying conventional patterns of fraud and error. This phenomenon has been termed Berserker Fraud. © 2024"

In the dynamics analysis session, Lyapunov exponents, bifurcation theory, and phase diagrams are used to analyze the effects of system parameters, coupling stiffness, and FO on the complex dynamical behaviors such as periodicity, pseudo-periodicity, and chaos oscillations. To suppress chaotic oscillations, a dynamic event-triggered finite-time prescribed performance controller is proposed. The unknown nonlinear functions are approximated through the interval type-3 fuzzy system (IT3FS) with an adaptive law. A novel finite-time prescribed performance function (finite-time PPF) is constructed to establish constrained boundaries for tracking errors. Compared with the existing PPFs, the proposed approach allows for more flexible setting of the convergence boundary before reaching steady-state. Subsequently, the constrained tracking errors are mapped to an unconstrained form using a nonlinear transformation function, whether the error constraint is symmetric or asymmetric. To circumvent the “explosion of complexity” arising from backstepping design process, a tracking differentiator (TD) is utilized. Additionally, to alleviate strain on communication resources, an event-triggered mechanism is devised to update control signals. The trigger threshold of the control signals can be adaptively adjusted based on the values of the Lyapunov function and the dynamic auxiliary variables. This control method guarantees finite-time convergence for all signals of the system. Finally, extensive simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The framework mathematically models various nonlinear behaviors (including mechanical nonlinearity, non-wind-induced aerodynamic nonlinearity, amplitude-dependent flutter complex mode and wind-induced aerodynamic damping, and nonlinear coupling of vertical aerostatic deformation) present in free-vibration wind tunnel tests. The identification of parameters of all concerned nonlinear models in this framework only requires displacement responses from simple free-vibration wind tunnel tests, which makes it convenient for practical engineering applications. Meanwhile, a corresponding numerical solving procedure for nonlinear aeroelastic responses is also developed. The feasibility of the proposed modeling framework is then cross-validated through wind tunnel tests with a novel large-amplitude testing device, and the coupled vertical aerostatic deformation observed under large amplitudes can be well predicted by an asymmetric lift force model in the framework. Then, based on the validated nonlinear aerodynamic force model, a three-dimensional (3D) nonlinear flutter analysis method for full-bridge is established, and the influences of 3D effects on nonlinear flutter are investigated. The results show that ignoring 3D effects will significantly misestimate the nonlinear flutter amplitudes. Finally, based on the results of wind tunnel tests, it is verified that the proposed modeling framework has the ability to predict nonlinear bifurcation behavior (i.e., the final state of vertical and torsional vibrations at a given wind speed depends on the initial conditions) that occurs in 2DOF (two-degree-of-freedom) coupled flutter. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Gender disparities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) affect a country's innovation and ability to tackle global challenges. Therefore, recent national education policies have looked for ways to promote gender equality, particularly in the STEM subjects. One problem is that teaching materials often lack female representation and recognition of female achievements and contributions to STEM subjects, affecting how female students perceive science. The study examines how female students aged 15 to 18 are impacted by gender disparity in their physics teaching materials and what importance they place on female role models. It encompasses 20 group interviews with female students (n = 80) in Switzerland, which were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results show that, aside from Marie Curie, female scientists are largely unknown to female students, contributing to the perception of physics as a male domain. Female role models are crucial for fostering interest, motivation, and self-esteem in STEM subjects. However, internalized gender stereotypes and fears of negative reactions from male peers counter the demand for greater visibility of female scientists. Despite these challenges, most female students advocate for more female role models in STEM to inspire future generations of female students to pursue a STEM career and foster positive social change. © 2024"

The Adomian decomposition method (ADM) and ADM-Pade approximation technique have been implemented to solve the governing equation. Environmental or climate changes, along with the propagation of air or water waves, can lead to uncertainties or ambiguities in initial or boundary conditions, as well as in parameter associated with the Coriolis effect. To address these uncertainties, this work aims to find the approximate fuzzy solution to the said physical problem by applying a double parametric approach with the help of ADM. To validate the obtained solution, comparisons are made between the fuzzy solutions and existing precise (crisp) solutions in specific cases. Furthermore, in another scenario involving the fuzzy solution, the ADM-Pade approach is employed. This implementation yields an approximate solution that exhibits higher accuracy and closely resembles a solitary wave solution, demonstrating a rapid convergence rate. The analysis of special cases shows a direct relationship between wave height and the Coriolis parameter and an inverse relationship between wavelength and the Coriolis parameter.

More specifically, it remains unclear whether deficits are restricted to visuospatial content or are more general and whether they could explain arithmetical impairment. Methods: Fifteen 5- to 12-year-old children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and 23 age-matched healthy controls performed a non-symbolic magnitude comparison task. Depending on the trial, participants had to compare stimuli with high or low visuospatial load (visuospatial stimuli or temporal sequence of visual stimuli). The participants also completed a battery of arithmetic skills (ZAREKI-R) and a battery of global cognitive functioning (WISC-V or WPPSI-IV), from which working memory and visuospatial indices were derived. Results: Children with 22q11.2DS responded as fast as healthy controls did but received fewer correct responses, irrespective of visuospatial load. In addition, their performance in the non-symbolic magnitude comparison task did not correlate with the ZAREKI total score, while the working memory index did. Conclusion: Children with 22q11.2DS might suffer from a global magnitude representation deficit rather than a specific deficit due to visuospatial load. However, this deficit alone does not seem to be related to arithmetic achievement. Working memory might be a better concern of interest in favoring arithmetic skills in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials, NCT04373226.

Analog computing with electromagnetic waves presents an intriguing opportunity to solve calculus equations with unparalleled speed, while facing an inevitable tradeoff in computing density and equation reconfigurability. Here, we propose a reconfigurable metamaterial processing unit (MPU) that solves arbitrary linear calculus equations at a very fast speed. Subwavelength kernels based on inverse-designed pixel metamaterials are used to perform calculus operations on time-domain signals. In addition, feedback mechanisms and reconfigurable components are used to formulate and solve calculus equations with different orders and coefficients. A prototype of this MPU with a compact planar size of 0.93λ0×0.93λ0 (λ0 is the free-space wavelength) is constructed and evaluated in microwave frequencies. Experimental results demonstrate the MPU’s ability to successfully solve arbitrary linear calculus equations.

Primary source readings and discussion frameworks can tangibly link data analysis to questions of values within data science, computing ethics, or statistics courses. The particular cases of Sir Francis Galton and Sir Ronald Fisher—both statisticians and eugenicists—provide a rich collection of easily accessible digitized primary source material as well as a vast number of related popular and technical publications. Galton and Fisher figured centrally in the development of statistics as it is currently practiced (a substantial proportion of the technical content of introductory statistics courses were introduced by these men). However, the familiar tools of correlation and hypothesis testing were developed to analyze human data, often in service to the cause of eugenics. This article critically describes how we embedded problematic primary sources from Galton and Fisher into our courses and the discussions that ensued.

For some tasks, it is more realistic in practice to search for a model architecture. In this paper, we introduce the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm which has achieved great success in classical neural architecture search to find good variational quantum circuits for two real-world tasks of ground state energy estimations and multimodal fusion. We adapt the Monte Carlo Tree Search to the quantum scenario by considering more sophisticated classifiers within the tree nodes to partition the search space into several subregions based on the model performance. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method has the ability to recognize good models from the vast search space in both tasks. More importantly, the discovered variational quantum circuits demonstrate their advantages in fusing multimodal features under the comprehensive consideration of parameter number and performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

Bifurcation analysis allows us to identify causes for backward bifurcation, thereby helping to design a strategy to avoid such phenomena for disease eradication. In this study, we perform an in-depth bifurcation analysis of a malaria model incorporating cross-border mobility between two countries to explore mobility's role in backward bifurcation. Our analysis reveals that cross-border mobility can be a primary driving force for backward bifurcation in malaria dynamics. This novel result with cross-border mobility bringing backward bifurcation advances the traditional idea of disease-induced death being the primary driver of backward bifurcation. Using the malaria case in Nepal with cross-border mobility between Nepal–India, we validated analytical results by numerical simulations. Our model predicts that the disease-free equilibrium exists only if cross-border mobility or infection abroad are absent and malaria eradication is possible in Nepal. Otherwise, there is the coexistence of three endemic equilibria with a lower and higher stable epidemic level. Results on the bifurcation of our model may be helpful to control dynamics in order to maintain the malaria epidemic at a low level if it cannot be eradicated due to the entry of cases through cross-border mobility. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Methods: Data were collected following class cancellations mandated by the Ministry of Education due to an outbreak of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in April 2022. A national parent organization developed self-report survey questionnaire, “Impact of the Pandemic-related School Closures/Class Cancellations” (IPRSCCC), assessed parents’ perceived impact of school cancellations on their child/children’ and on their adaptation. The online survey was available between May 4 and May 9, 2022, in 20 districts throughout Taiwan. Results: A total of 2126 parents representing 2592 children responded. Total scores on the IPRSCCC were significantly higher for parents of children whose classes were cancelled (n = 891) compared with parents whose children continued in-person classes (n = 1053). Parents perceived the class cancellations of the child/children disrupted daily routine, learning loss and impacted academic motivation. They also reported emotional stress and no time for rest, which were associated with parental burnout. However for these parents, there were no significant differences in scores between parents living in low and high socioeconomic areas. Only the subscale score for disrupted daily routine was significantly higher for fathers, and emotional stress was significantly higher for parents with two, or ≥ 3 children. When academic impacts were examined using national examination scores for 12th grade students, the percent of students with scores of ≤ 6 in English, Chinese, and mathematics was higher in 2022 than in 2020. Conclusions: Higher IPRSCCC scores for parents of children whose classes were cancelled provides additional evidence of the impact of disruptions of in-person classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Examination scores confirmed class cancellations impacted academic performance. © The Author(s) 2024."

If quantum algorithms are applied to perform these iterative operations, the rank-based attacks may be more threatening to multi-layer UOV, including Rainbow. In this paper, we propose a quantum rectangular MinRank attack called the Q-rMinRank attack, the first quantum approach to key recovery attacks on multi-layer UOV signatures. Our attack is a general model applicable to multi-layer UOV signature schemes, and in this paper, we provide examples of its application to Rainbow and the Korean TTA standard, HiMQ. We design two quantum oracle circuits to find the kernel in consideration of the depth-width trade-off of quantum circuits. One is to reduce the width of the quantum circuits using qubits as a minimum, and the other is to reduce the depth using parallelization instead of using a lot of qubits. By designing quantum circuits to find kernels with fewer quantum resources and complexity by adding mathematical techniques, we achieve quadratic speedup for the MinRank attack to recover the private keys of multi-layer UOV signatures. We also estimate quantum resources for the designed quantum circuits and analyze quantum complexity based on them. The width-optimized circuit recovers the private keys of Rainbow parameter set V with only 1089 logical qubits. The depth-optimized circuit recovers the private keys of Rainbow parameter set V with a quantum complexity of 2174, which is lower than the complexity of 2221 recovering the secret key of AES-192, which provides the same security level as parameter set III. © The Author(s) 2024."

Here, based on the DFT barrier of methylene-H abstraction by nitro group (HONO elimination) and the continuous reaction model, an experimentally comparable half-life of BDNPF is reported by transition state theory simulation. Rather than the HONO elimination-addition reactions, HONO bimolecular decompositions are preferred, where the energetically preferred pathway involves formation of N2O3, and generation of N2O4 and HNO catalyzed by HONO. Interestingly, newly reported transition state bifurcations lower the barriers and accelerate HONO decomposition, which also leads to the rate constant of generating HNO consistent with experiments. Moreover, HNO undertakes hydrogen transferred bimolecular pathway and HONO-catalyzed pathway to decompose into N2O and H2O.

Firstly, the torsional stiffness model of the coupling considering the influence of excess is constructed by using finite element and response surface theory, and it is verified that the model can make up for the shortcoming of losing high-frequency vibration information. Secondly, the sensitivity of the coupling torsional stiffness eigenvalues to the structure-excess parameter is explored using the Sobol’ method. Thirdly, the effects of structure-excess parameters on the vibration stability of the coupling were observed using bifurcation diagrams. By comparing the vibration characteristics of the coupling under different amounts of excess, it is found that the vibration state of the coupling tends to be chaotic, accompanied by unstable phenomena such as resonance, and the increase in excess helps to control the torsional angle of the coupling. At the same time, in the low excess state, the middle shaft thickness changes so that the coupling resonance region shows a concentration of characteristics, and the sensitivity of the vibration state of the coupling to the change of the inclination angle in the middle taper area is neglected. In the high excess condition, the change of the middle shaft thickness will lead to scattered degradation in the resonance region of the coupling, and the change of the inclination angle will lead to intermittent chaotic vibration of the coupling, causing unstable vibration of the coupling. The research results of this paper can not only make up for the loss of high-frequency vibration information of the coupling, but also control the vibration amplitude and vibration state of the coupling, so as to reduce the probability of damage to the coupling laminations. © 2024"

The system involves complex impact processes, including contact, deformation, recovery, and disengagement. To address the technical challenges posed by the system discontinuity at the moment of impact, we establish a mapping relation between impact events to solve the system response. Considering that the non-smooth moment of such systems exists only at the moment of contact with the impact surface, we chose to select the impact surface as a Poincaré cross-section. Two independent mappings were established to describe the transition of the oscillator from leaving the obstacle to the next contact with the obstacle, and from contacting the obstacle to leaving the obstacle. These two consecutive mappings were integrated into the plane to form a unified mapping. This method was employed to investigate the response probability density function of the system for autonomous and non-autonomous systems, respectively. The effectiveness of the methodology was validated by the use of Monte Carlo simulations, in addition to the discovery of the stochastic P-bifurcation phenomenon. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Based on this method, entire phase diagrams in the parameter space can be obtained by bifurcation tracking and continuation at low computational costs.

However, uncovering valuable insights from big data is like locating a needle in a haystack, and it is difficult for teachers to use educational big data on their own. This study aimed to understand changes in student participation rates during classes and teachers’ teaching styles by analyzing educational big data. In the analysis, data from 120 students and two mathematics class teachers at a public junior high school in Japan were used. We applied the pruned exact linear time (PELT) algorithm to automatically identify significant changes in student participation during class. Based on the information obtained, we analyzed the interaction logs of teachers’ e-book readers and clarified the relationship between student participation rates and teacher behavior patterns. Change point detection using the PELT algorithm showed a high F1-score of 0.7929, indicating good overall performance. We also investigated whether there was a relationship between class differences and teachers’ actions and found a statistically significant difference. The results provide clues for improving student learning engagement and teachers’ teaching styles, and they are expected to improve the quality of education by automatically identifying notable cases from educational big data.

First-principles calculations demonstrate significant compact of material type and elemental doping on interfacial compatibility between silicon oxycarbide and various electrolytes. By proposing several novel descriptors including interfacial adhesion and formation energies of frozen system with low computation cost, the amounts of demanded trainings data are significantly reduced. Gradient-boosted regression tree model shows low mean absolute errors of 0.09 and high R2 value of 0.99 for the prediction of interface formation energy, demonstrating ultrahigh accuracy and reliability of the algorithm.

To investigate this matter, we examined the performance of 127 third- and fourth-grade children who read aloud, in Hebrew, numbers with 2–5 digits. We found several key observations. First, we observed a substantial variation among the 3rd graders—7% and 59% errors in the top and bottom deciles, respectively. Second, the task difficulty stemmed from syntactic processing: Most errors were distortions of the number’s syntax, as opposed to digit substitutions or transpositions, and the main factor affecting a specific number’s difficulty was not its magnitude, as is commonly assumed, but rather its syntactic structure. Third, number reading performance was not predicted by a school-like task that assessed syntactic-conceptual knowledge of the decimal system structure, but rather by knowledge of specific syntactic-verbal rules, suggesting that the syntactic-verbal knowledge is separate from the syntactic-conceptual knowledge. Last, there was a double dissociation between 4-digit numbers and 5-digit numbers, which in Hebrew have completely different syntactic structures: Half of the children showed a significant advantage in one number length compared to the other, with equal numbers of children preferring either length. This indicates that the different syntactic-verbal rules are learned relatively independently of each other, with little or no generalization from one rule to another. In light of these findings, we propose that schools should specifically teach number reading, with focus on specific syntactic-verbal rules. © The Author(s) 2024."

The model assumes that the production output of the public firm is influenced by the past output levels of the private firms. The output levels of the private firms are affected by the past production outputs of both the public firm and their private competitors. The study identifies two equilibrium states within the nonlinear system: a positive equilibrium and a boundary equilibrium. Through a stability analysis, it is established that the boundary equilibrium is a saddle point. In the absence of time delays, the stability region for the positive equilibrium is determined. The research explores various specific delay scenarios, finding conditions under which the positive equilibrium is asymptotic stability. Additionally, the occurrence of flip and Neimark–Sacker bifurcations are examined.

Recent research has provided a lot of progress concerning the reconstruction of such networks from data as well as insight into their graph theoretical properties. However, methods and tools to quantify structural properties of networks or differences between them are still very limited. For example, for phylogenetic trees, it is common to use balance indices to draw conclusions concerning the underlying evolutionary model, and more than twenty such indices have been proposed and are used for different purposes. One of the most frequently used balance index for trees is the so-called total cophenetic index, which has several mathematically and biologically desirable properties. For networks, on the other hand, balance indices are to-date still scarce. In this contribution, we introduce the weighted total cophenetic index as a generalization of the total cophenetic index for trees to make it applicable to general phylogenetic networks. As we shall see, this index can be determined efficiently and behaves in a mathematical sound way, i.e., it satisfies so-called locality and recursiveness conditions. In addition, we analyze its extremal properties and, in particular, we investigate its maxima and minima as well as the structure of networks that achieve these values within the space of so-called level-1 networks. We finally briefly compare this novel index to the two other network balance indices available so-far. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Current approaches often struggle with session initiation, real-time data processing, and personalized learning experiences. To tackle these issues, the study proposes a manifold learning data analytics model (MLDAM). This innovative method leverages classifier tree learning to distinguish between trivial and non-trivial aspects of student learning experiences and session data. MLDAM integrates multi-dimensional data extraction, classification learning, and impact evaluation to enhance the effectiveness of online English language teaching. The model analyzes data from 176,009 English phrases across 36 online teaching sessions, focusing on improving session accessibility, student comprehension, and suggestion accuracy. Using an iterative training process based on student performance and feedback, it continuously extracts and processes multiple types of data to refine teaching strategies. Results show notable improvements: a 14.74% increase in classification accuracy, an 8.73% increase in data extraction ratio, an 11.84% reduction in feature discard, a 10.57% decrease in initialization time, and a 13.17% reduction in classification time. These metrics demonstrate MLDAM’s ability to efficiently process and analyze session data, enabling real-time adjustments during lessons. The model optimizes data utilization, making learning more responsive and adaptable. It enhances the precision of impact evaluations, facilitating targeted course adjustments and personalized learning experiences.

However, for complex data sets, there might exist data points from different classes in the same local tree. In this article, we use pairwise constraint information to resolve this issue and propose a semi-supervised local density peaks and graph cut based clustering algorithm (SLDPC). In particular, SLDPC proposes intra-cluster conflict resolution and inter-cluster conflict resolution steps to split the local trees which are inconsistent with the provided pairwise constraint information. Theoretically, we show that the two steps will finish in a finite number of operations and the split local trees will be consistent with the pairwise constraint information. Subsequently, root node redirection and noise filtering steps are designed to avoid the local trees becoming too fragmented. Finally, we exploit the E2CP algorithm to further improve the similarity matrix between local trees using the pairwise constraint information, and the spectral clustering algorithm is adopted to obtain the clustering result. Experiments on multiple widely used synthetic and real-world data sets show that SLDPC is superior to LDP-SC and several other semi-supervised prominent clustering algorithms for most of the cases. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The influence of roadway shape on the evolution of static pressure was explored, and the role of pulverized coal in the process of static pressure dynamic disaster was clarified. The results indicated that the static pressure showed a fluctuating downward trend during the outburst process. When gas outburst, the middle and front parts of the roadway in the straight section roadway were the most serious areas of static pressure disasters in the three shapes of roadways. The duration and range of high static pressure disaster in L-shaped roadway were larger than those in T-shaped and straight roadways in turn. When CGO, the most serious area of static pressure disaster in L-shaped and T-shaped roadways moved backward to the middle of the straight section roadway, and there was a rebound phenomenon in the process of static pressure fluctuation decline, which showed the pulse characteristics of CGO. During the outburst, the static pressure dynamic disaster hazard of L-shaped roadway was higher than that of T-shaped roadway, and the static pressure at the bifurcation structure decayed faster than that at the turning structure, which indicated that T-shaped roadway was more conducive to the release of static pressure in roadway, thus reduced the risk of static pressure disaster. When gas outburst, the static pressure attenuation of the fluid in the roadway before and after the turning and bifurcation structure was greater than that of CGO. The peak static pressure and impulse of the fluid during gas outburst were 2 times and 4–5 times that of CGO respectively. The presence of pulverized coal reduced the attenuation of static pressure and the hazard of dynamic disaster, prolonged the release time of energy, and led to the change of the maximum static pressure disaster area. © The Author(s) 2024."

To investigate the pattern dynamics, we first give the occurrence conditions of the Turing bifurcation. It is found that there is no Turing bifurcation when predator-taxis disappears, while the Turing bifurcation occurs as predator-taxis is presented. Next, we establish the amplitude equation by virtue of weakly nonlinear analysis. Our theoretical result suggests the Lotka-Volterra model admits the supercritical or subcritical Turing bifurcation. In this manner, we can determine the stability of the bifurcating solution. Finally, some numerical simulation results verify the validity of the theoretical analysis. The stripe pattern, the mixed patterns, and wave patterns are performed. Interestingly, the stable stripe patterns will be broken and become wave patterns when the predator-taxis parameter is far from the Turing bifurcation critical point. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

That is, they need to assess students' learning outcomes accurately. Intervention studies that aimed at fostering (pre-service) teachers' assessment competencies during the assessment process show only limited effects on assessment accuracy. Adapting support measures to individual assessment processes has the potential to increase the effects. However, developing adaptive support requires a concise understanding of how assessment processes are related to individual learners’ dispositions (e.g., knowledge, interest) on the one hand and the accuracy of their assessments on the other. Aims: We aimed to characterize the relationships between pre-service teachers’ dispositions, assessment process, and assessment accuracy to establish a basis for adaptive support during the assessment process. Sample: We analysed 65 mathematics pre-service teachers’ assessment processes in a digital simulation of a task-based assessment situation. Methods: Pre-service teachers' assessment processes were measured by recording their log data in a digital simulation. Patterns of process indicators were interpreted as modes of cognitive engagement. Process indicators included participants' selections of mathematical tasks and their interpretations of simulated students’ task solutions. Results: We found pronounced individual differences in pre-service teachers' assessment processes, reflecting a passive, active, or constructive mode of engagement. Engagement modes were related to participants’ individual interest in student assessment. Moreover, engagement modes predicted differences in assessment accuracy above and beyond cognitive dispositions. Conclusions: Log data from a digital simulation help unravel the link between teachers' dispositions and accuracy in assessment situations. The results provide a basis for developing adaptive support for pre-service mathematics teachers’ assessment competencies. © 2024 The Authors"

To justify correctness properties of the safety-critical control algorithms for their physical models, differential dynamic logic ([Formula presented]) provides deductive specification and verification techniques implemented in the theorem prover [Formula presented]. The logic [Formula presented] is useful for proving, e.g., that all runs of a hybrid dynamical system α satisfy safety property φ (i.e., [Formula presented]), or that there is a run of the hybrid dynamical system α ultimately reaching the desired goal φ (i.e., [Formula presented]). Logical combinations of [Formula presented]'s operators naturally represent safety, liveness, stability and other properties. Variations of [Formula presented] serve additional purposes. Differential refinement logic ([Formula presented]) adds an operator α≤β expressing that hybrid system α refines hybrid system β, which is useful, e.g., for relating concrete system implementations α to their abstract verification models β. Just like [Formula presented], [Formula presented] is a logic closed under all operators, which opens up systematic ways of simultaneously relating systems and their properties, of reducing system properties to system relations or, vice versa, reducing system relations to system properties.

In this regard, airway segmentation plays a critical role in the production of the outline of the entire airway tree to enable estimation of disease extent and severity. Furthermore, the segmentation of a complete airway tree is challenging as the intensity, scale/size and shape of airway segments and their walls change across generations. The existing classical techniques either provide an undersegmented or oversegmented airway tree, and manual intervention is required for optimal airway tree segmentation. The recent development of deep learning methods provides a fully automatic way of segmenting airway trees; however, these methods usually require high GPU memory usage and are difficult to implement in low computational resource environments. Therefore, in this study, we propose a data-centric deep learning technique with big interpolated data, Interpolation-Split, to boost the segmentation performance of the airway tree. The proposed technique utilises interpolation and image split to improve data usefulness and quality. Then, an ensemble learning strategy is implemented to aggregate the segmented airway segments at different scales. In terms of average segmentation performance (dice similarity coefficient, DSC), our method (A) achieves 90.55%, 89.52%, and 85.80%; (B) outperforms the baseline models by 2.89%, 3.86%, and 3.87% on average; and (C) produces maximum segmentation performance gain by 14.11%, 9.28%, and 12.70% for individual cases when (1) nnU-Net with instant normalisation and leaky ReLU; (2) nnU-Net with batch normalisation and ReLU; and (3) modified dilated U-Net are used respectively. Our proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art airway segmentation approaches. Furthermore, our proposed technique has low RAM and GPU memory usage, and it is GPU memory-efficient and highly flexible, enabling it to be deployed on any 2D deep learning model. © The Author(s) 2024."

It is widely used in real scenarios and provides important support for big data mining and analysis. Most existing matching methods take the single-connected graph as the matching graph, which has a high computational cost. Simultaneously, the construction and matching complexity of its index on multi-connected temporal subgraph matching is high. To solve the above problems, we propose a new temporal subgraph matching problem for multi-connected temporal graphs and proposes the corresponding efficient filtering-selecting-matching three-stage multi-connected temporal subgraph matching method. In the filtering stage, a vertex-based filter is proposed to generate a candidate temporal subgraph set. In the select phase, a set of temporal subgraphs satisfying the vertex mapping is found. In the matching stage, the single-filter temporal subgraph matching method and temporal subgraph matching based on the temporal information tree index method are proposed to solve the problems that the edges of multi-connected temporal subgraphs cannot be mapped and the single graph matching efficiency is low, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the matching accuracy, and the corresponding index size is reduced. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

In discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science, they have attained a lot of attention from both the structural and complexity perspectives. Nonetheless, disconnected graphs were usually omitted from the considerations with the explanation that it is sufficient to understand coverings of the connected components of the target graph by components of the source one. However, different (but equivalent) versions of the definition of covers of connected graphs generalize to non-equivalent definitions for disconnected graphs. The aim of this paper is to summarize this issue and to compare three different approaches to covers of disconnected graphs: (1) locally bijective homomorphisms, (2) globally surjective locally bijective homomorphisms (which we call surjective covers), and (3) locally bijective homomorphisms which cover every vertex the same number of times (which we call equitable covers). The standpoint of our comparison is the complexity of deciding if an input graph covers a fixed target graph. We show that both surjective and equitable covers satisfy what certainly is a natural and welcome property: covering a disconnected graph is polynomial-time decidable if such it is for every connected component of the graph, and it is NP-complete if it is NP-complete for at least one of its components. We further argue that the third variant, equitable covers, is the most natural one, namely when considering covers of colored graphs. Moreover, the complexity of surjective and equitable covers differ from the fixed parameter complexity point of view. In line with the current trends in topological graph theory, as well as its applications in mathematical physics, we consider graphs in a very general sense: our graphs may contain loops, multiple edges and also semi-edges. Moreover, both vertices and edges may be colored, in which case the covering projection must respect the colors. We conclude the paper by a complete characterization of the complexity of covering 2-vertex colored graphs, and show that poly-time/NP-completeness dichotomy holds true for this case. We actually aim for a stronger dichotomy. All our polynomial-time algorithms work for arbitrary input graphs, while the NP-completeness theorems hold true even in the case of simple input graphs. © 2024"

This is particularly the case in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education, which is a uniquely demanding and challenging field. This study examined the role of emotional regulation (ER) skills in STEM teachers’ stress, well-being, and burnout. The sample included 165 STEM teachers in middle and high schools who completed standard online questionnaires on ER, stress, well-being, and burnout. They were also asked to comment on three videos depicting authentic mathematical and pedagogical situations. The results indicated that contrary to popular belief, seniority was not linked with levels of stress, difficulties in ER, lower levels of well-being, or higher levels of burnout. A structural equation model and bootstrapping analysis showed teachers’ levels of stress predicted their well-being, and this link between stress and well-being was mediated by teachers’ level of difficulty in ER. The study highlights the importance of STEM teachers’ well-being and suggests the need to reduce stress and burnout by providing tools for teachers to regulate their emotions in the classroom. © The Author(s) 2024."

Despite the significant momentum recently gained by the FL paradigm, most of the existing approaches in the field neglect another key pillar for the trustworthiness of AI systems, namely explainability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for FL of fuzzy regression trees (FRTs), which are generally acknowledged as highly interpretable by-design models. The proposed FL procedure is designed for the scenario of horizontally partitioned data and is based on the transmission of aggregated statistics from the clients to a central server for the tree induction procedure. It is shown that the proposed approach faithfully approximates the ideal case in which the tree induction algorithm is applied on the union of all local datasets, while still ensuring privacy preservation. Furthermore, the FL approach brings benefits, in terms of generalization capability, compared to the local learning setting in which each participant learns its own FRT based only on the private, local, dataset. The adoption of linear models in the leaf nodes ensures a competitive level of performance, as assessed by an extensive experimental campaign on benchmark datasets. The analysis of the results covers both the aspects of accuracy and interpretability of FRT. Finally, we discuss the application of the proposed federated FRT to the task of Quality of Experience forecasting in an automotive case-study. © 2024 The Author(s)"

They are now a major news source worldwide, leading to the online proliferation of Fake News (FNs). These FNs are alarming because they fundamentally reshape public opinion, which may cause customers to leave these online platforms, threatening the reputations of several organizations and industries. This rapid dissemination of FNs makes it imperative for automated systems to detect them, encouraging many researchers to propose various systems to classify news articles and detect FNs automatically. In this paper, a Fake News Detection (FND) methodology is presented based on an effective IBAVO-AO algorithm, which stands for hybridization of African Vultures Optimization (AVO) and Aquila Optimization (AO) algorithms, with an extreme gradient boosting Tree (Xgb-Tree) classifier. The suggested methodology involves three main phases: Initially, the unstructured FNs dataset is analyzed, and the essential features are extracted by tokenizing, encoding, and padding the input news words into a sequence of integers utilizing the GLOVE approach. Then, the extracted features are filtered using the effective Relief algorithm to select only the appropriate ones. Finally, the recovered features are used to classify the news items using the suggested IBAVO-AO algorithm based on the Xgb-Tree classifier. Hence, the suggested methodology is distinguished from prior models in that it performs automatic data pre-processing, optimization, and classification tasks. The proposed methodology is carried out on the ISOT-FNs dataset, containing more than 44 thousand multiple news articles divided into truthful and fake. We validated the proposed methodology’s reliability by examining numerous evaluation metrics involving accuracy, fitness values, the number of selected features, Kappa, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Specificity, Sensitivity, ROC_AUC, and MCC. Then, the proposed methodology is compared against the most common meta-heuristic optimization algorithms utilizing the ISOT-FNs. The experimental results reveal that the suggested methodology achieved optimal classification accuracy and F1-score and successfully categorized more than 92.5% of news articles compared to its peers. This study will assist researchers in expanding their understanding of meta-heuristic optimization algorithms applications for FND. Graphical Abstract: (Figure presented.) © The Author(s) 2024."

However, little research concerns the characterization of faculty’s reflections. Before professional development programs can effectively incorporate reflective writings as a tool for pedagogical improvement, it is necessary to first understand the current state of faculty’s reflections. To accomplish this goal, 98 physics and astronomy instructors were recruited from a teaching-focused professional development workshop and were asked to write a reflection on a self-identified challenging teaching experience. A combination of a priori coding to analyze the content and depth of the reflections, as well as in vivo coding to better capture instructors’ thinking were utilized. The majority of instructors wrote low-level reflections, wherein connections were not made between an instructors’ actions and the observed outcomes or the described experience was not centered on students’ outcomes or educational research literature. Approximately half of the instructors contemplated their own growth and the relationships with their students. However, only a small minority of instructors considered larger societal, cultural, or ethical factors. Plans created by instructors to address future, similar situations heavily relied on the instructors themselves, regardless of the depth of their reflections, and few planned to seek out knowledge from other resources such as peers or the education literature. This study indicates that instructors may not engage in the types of reflection that are considered to promote meaningful instructional change. Trends in the instructors’ plans show that ongoing support is necessary for them to effectively reflect and grow as practitioners. Overall, this work provides valuable insight into the poorly understood nature of faculty’s reflections and showcases the need for more research to fully characterize reflections across STEM disciplines and to better inform professional development. © The Author(s) 2024."

Persian physicians have played an undeniable role in the advancement of medicine worldwide and their books have been taught as medical textbooks in the East and the West for years. In the Islamic Golden Age (9th to 12th century AD), Abu-Sahl al-Masihi (960-1010 AD), was one of the great Persian scholars contemporary to Avicenna and Al-Biruni. He wrote several valuable works on medicine, philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy in Arabic. The two books titled Al-Mia fil-Tibb (Book of the Hundred [on Medicine]) and Ezhar al-Hekmat Allah Ta’ala fi Khalgh al-Ensan (Manifestations of God’s Wisdom in the Creation of Mankind) also known as Tashrih Badan al-Ensan (Human Anatomy) are among his important works in medicine. Particularly, in Tashrih Badan al-Ensan, Abu-Sahl detailed the structure and function of each organ within the human body. On heart anatomy, he presented interesting, and even innovative views. Despite the significance of his views on medicine among physicians of the Islamic era, his works have failed to be translated into Latin or other languages for unknown reasons, leaving him veiled in academic spheres. This paper aims to describe Abu-Sahl al-Masihi's opinions on heart anatomy. © 2024 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

The randomized controlled study adopted a purposive sampling procedure to select three schools for the Deaf and Deaf learners (DLs) in Oyo State. A random sampling procedure was employed to select 60 DLs who were assigned to two experimental groups REBT (n = 25; male = 10; female = 15), RT (n = 17; male = 8; female = 9), and a control group (n = 20; male = 11; female = 9). The Mathematics Anxiety Scale (MAS) was used to screen the participants. The data gathered were analysed using the analysis of variance and descriptive charts. The findings revealed the efficacy of the two therapeutic interventions in reducing MA among DLs. The estimated mean difference between the treatment and control groups showed the following: REBT (15.66), RT (11.63), and control group (9.99).

To this end, using data from High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, this study utilized the multi-group analysis under the framework of structural equation modeling to examine gender differences in the reciprocal relationship between mathematics self-efficacy and mathematics achievement. The results showed that there were statistically significant differences between male students and female students in the reciprocal relationship between mathematics self-efficacy and mathematics achievement; the impact of prior mathematics achievement on later mathematics achievement was stronger than the impact of prior mathematics self-efficacy on later mathematics self-efficacy.

Research taking a network approach may provide deeper insights into the formation and benefits of mentorship for undergraduate students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Utilizing Developmental Mentor Network Theory and ego-centric social network analysis, this pre-registered study evaluates how the characteristics of mentees and mentors relate to both the content of support and structure of mentor networks in a large sample of White and Hispanic/Latino(a) STEM undergraduates across 12 universities. Results: Results were nuanced but showed that perceived psychological similarity with their mentor(s) predicted both dyadic and network average levels of mentor support (i.e., psychosocial, career, role modeling) and relational satisfaction. Furthermore, results point to homophily and engagement in undergraduate research effects on mentor network structures. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of using a network approach to deepen our understanding of the factors (e.g., psychological similarity) that may influence the formation and maintenance of robust and diverse supportive mentoring networks. © The Author(s) 2024."

The Boussinesq model examines wave propagation in shallow water, which is derived from the fluid dynamics of a dynamical system. The UREE approach allows us to derive a range of distinct solutions, such as single, periodic, dark, and rational wave solutions. Furthermore, we present the bifurcation, chaotic, and sensitivity analysis of the proposed model. We use planar dynamical system theory to analyze the structure and characteristics of the system’s phase portraits. The current study depends on a dynamic structure that has novel and unexplored results for this model. In addition, we display the behaviors of associated physical models in 3-dimensional, density, and 2-dimensional graphical structures.

Yet, regular use of high-quality active learning is not the norm in many STEM departments. Using results of a national survey, we identified 16 departments where multiple instructors reported using high levels of active learning in their introductory chemistry, mathematics, or physics courses. We conducted interviews with 27 instructors in these 16 departments to better understand the characteristics of such departments. Results: Using grounded theory methodology, we developed a model that highlights relevant characteristics of departments with high use of active learning instruction in their introductory courses. According to this model, there are four main, interconnected characteristics of such departments: motivated people, knowledge about active learning, opportunities, and cultures and structures that support active learning. These departments have one or more people who are motivated to promote the use of active learning. These motivated people have knowledge about active learning as well as access to opportunities to promote the use of active learning. Finally, these departments have cultures and structures that support the use of active learning. In these departments, there is a positive feedback loop that works iteratively over time, where motivated people shape cultures/structures and these cultures/structures in turn increase the number and level of commitment of the motivated people. A second positive feedback loop was found between the positive outcome of using active learning instruction and the strengthening of cultures/structures supportive of active learning. Conclusions: According to the model, there are two main take-away messages for those interested in promoting the use of active learning. The first is that all four components of the model are important. A weak or missing component may limit the desired outcome. The second is that desired outcomes are obtained and strengthened over time through two positive feedback loops. Thus, there is a temporal aspect to change. In all of the departments that were part of our study, the changes took at minimum several years to enact. While our model was developed using only high-use of active learning departments and future work is needed to develop the model into a full change theory, our results do suggest that change efforts may be made more effective by increasing the robustness of the four components and the connections between them. © The Author(s) 2024."

An efficient and accurate RFID system can significantly improve the management efficiency and resource utilization of the training room, thereby improving teaching quality and reducing management costs. Although RFID technology has many advantages, there are still some problems in practical applications, such as label collision and recognition of unknown labels. These issues not only affect the performance of the system but may also cause interference with actual teaching and management. This study proposes a grouping-based bit arbitration query tree algorithm and anti-collision technology to solve label collisions and reduce label recognition time in the technology. A new unknown label recognition algorithm is also proposed to improve the recognition efficiency and accuracy of identifying new unknown labels. Related experiments have shown that the recognition accuracy of the algorithm designed this time is 95.86%. Compared with other algorithms, the number of idle time slots is the smallest. When the number of queries is 1000, the algorithm has 1842 queries, and the communication complexity is the best. When the number of unknown tags is 10,000, the actual accuracy rate is 95.642%. Compared with traditional recognition algorithms, the new unknown label recognition algorithm has a smaller frame length in the same label proportion and good recognition performance. On a theoretical level, the research content on RFID technology helps to improve and develop the basic theories of the Internet of Things and intelligent recognition technology and provides solutions and application technologies for equipment management and IoT applications in training rooms. On a practical level, the research results can provide specific guidance for the management of training rooms, help solve equipment management and safety maintenance problems in practical applications, and improve the management efficiency of training rooms. © The Author(s) 2024."

Focusing on women aged 35–50, we examined the effectiveness of Tension-free Vaginal Tape (TVT) surgery and Vaginal Erbium Laser (VEL) treatment for over 15 years. The TVT group consisted of 102 patients who underwent surgery using either the Advantage Fit mid-urethral sling system (Boston Scientific Co., MA, USA) or the GYNECARE TVT retropubic system (Ethicon Inc., NJ, USA). The VEL group included 113 patients treated with a non-ablative Erbium: YAG laser (FotonaSmooth™ XS; Fotona d.o.o., Ljubljana, Slovenia), and there were 112 patients in the control group. We constructed a network diagram analyzing the correlations between health, demographic factors, treatment methods, and patient outcomes. By calculating the shortest path using heuristic functions, we identified significant correlations and treatment effects. This approach supports patient decision making by choosing between TVT and VEL treatments based on individual objectives. Our findings provide new insights into SUI treatment, highlighting the value of a data-driven personalized approach for clinical decision-making. This interdisciplinary study bridges the gap between mathematics and medicine, demonstrating the importance of a data-centric approach in clinical decisions. © The Author(s) 2024."

This study examined how changing career plans within STEM fields was associated with psychological indicators of career readiness. We conducted a large online survey of undergraduate students (N = 1,727) across 42 courses covering every major STEM discipline at a large U.S. research-intensive public university. Students reported about their career plans, whether plans had changed, motivation for those career plans, and satisfaction with and certainty of persisting with those plans. A trained team of coders classified whether students reported having STEM career plans at the time of the survey and at the beginning of college. Results: Students who said they had changed career plans within STEM fields during college also reported lower motivation for their new career plans, satisfaction with those plans, and certainty of persisting in them, compared to students who retained consistent STEM career plans. With few exceptions, these associations held across students’ gender, race, year in school, and STEM field of study. Within-STEM career plan changes were very common, reported by 55% of fourth-year STEM students. Women reported changing career plans within STEM fields more often than men. Implications: Results suggest that changing career plans within STEM is an important phenomenon to consider in preparing a qualified and diverse STEM workforce. Students who change career plans within STEM fields may need additional supports for their career motivation and satisfaction compared to students who do not change plans. © The Author(s) 2024."

Automatically constructing such a graphs, however, remains an unresolved challenge within knowledge representation. To tackle this challenge, we propose CtxKG, a method specifically aimed at extracting knowledge graphs in a context of limited resources in which the only input is a set of unstructured text documents. CtxKG is based on OpenIE (a relationship triple extraction method) and BERT (a language model) and contains four stages: the extraction of relationship triples directly from text; the identification of synonyms across triples; the merging of similar entities; and the building of bridges between knowledge graphs of different documents. Our method distinguishes itself from those in the current literature (i) through its use of the parse tree to avoid the overlapping entities produced by base implementations of OpenIE; and (ii) through its bridges, which create a connected network of graphs, overcoming a limitation similar methods have of one isolated graph per document. We compare our method to two others by generating graphs for movie articles from Wikipedia and contrasting them with benchmark graphs built from the OMDb movie database. Our results suggest that our method is able to improve multiple aspects of knowledge graph construction. They also highlight the critical role that triple identification and named-entity recognition have in improving the quality of automatically generated graphs, suggesting future paths for investigation. Finally, we apply CtxKG to build BlabKG, a knowledge graph for the Blue Amazon, and discuss possible improvements. © 2024 Chinese Academy of Sciences."

This growing body of research has identified contextual factors (e.g., classroom layout, departmental norms) as primary influencers of STEM instructors’ decision to implement EBIPs in their courses. However, models of influences on instructional practices indicate that context is only one type of factor to consider. Other factors fall at the individual level such as instructors’ past teaching experience and their views on learning. Few studies have been able to explore in depth the role of these individual factors on the adoption of EBIPs since it is challenging to control for contextual features when studying current instructors. Moreover, most studies exploring adoption of EBIPs do not take into account the distinctive features of each EBIP and the influence these features may have on the decision to adopt the EBIP. Rather, studies typically explore barriers and drivers to the implementation of EBIPs in general. In this study, we address these gaps in the literature by conducting an in-depth exploration of individual factors and EBIPs’ features that influence nine future STEM instructors’ decisions to incorporate a selected set of EBIPs in their teaching. Results: We had hypothesized that the future instructors would have different reasoning to support their decisions to adopt or not Peer Instruction and the 5E Model as the two EBIPs have distinctive features. However, our results demonstrate that instructors based their decisions on similar factors. In particular, we found that the main drivers of their decisions were (1) the compatibility of the EBIP with their past experiences as students and instructors as well as teaching values and (2) experiences provided in the pedagogical course they were enrolled in. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that when considering the adoption of EBIPs, there is a need to look beyond solely contextual influences on instructor’s decisions to innovate in their courses and explore individual factors. Moreover, professional development programs should leverage their participants past experiences as students and instructors and provide an opportunity for instructors to experience new EBIPs as learners and instructors. © The Author(s) 2024."

This online learning involved 30 prospective mathematics teachers through video conferences. An exploratory case study was conducted on 9 mathematics teacher candidates with the highest exam scores. Data were collected from the results of 4 mathematical critical thinking questions. The data were analyzed and described based on a predetermined framework. The results show various epistemological obstacles in critical thinking, namely difficulty in proving the relationship between two concepts, generalizing the relationship, finding multiple alternative solutions, and solving problems. The epistemological obstacles found can be the focus of lecturers in creating more structured online learning. Online learning needs to be well-planned in terms of the use of learning resources, learning media, and integration with technology.

According to our study, eigenvalues are utilized in chemistry to express a chemical compound’s numerous physical properties as well as its energy form. It is important to get a comprehensive understanding of the interrelationship underlying mathematics and chemistry. The anti-bonding phase is correlated with positive eigenvalues, whereas the bonding level is connected with negative eigenvalues. Additionally, the non-bonded level corresponds to eigenvalues of zero. This study focuses on the analysis of various structures of anticancer drugs, specifically examining their characteristic polynomials, eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix, matching number and nullity. Consequently, the selected structures of the aforementioned anticancer drugs exhibit stability since they are composed of closed-shell molecules, characterized by a nullity value of zero. © The Author(s) 2024."

Factorial research design was adopted for the study involving 100 students from 2 co-educational secondary schools drawn through multistage sampling procedure. Mathematics Achievement Test was the instrument used for data collection. The reliability of the instrument was established using Kudder Richardson (KR20) formula and a reliability coefficient of 0.92 was obtained. Descriptive statistics of mean and standard deviation were used to answer the research questions and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was employed to test the hypotheses at 0.05 level of significance. The findings of the study revealed that the muddiest point formative assessment technique proved to be more effective in improving students’ academic achievement in Mathematics than the think-pair-share technique. The findings also showed that the mean achievement scores of male and female students in Mathematics are not statistically significant. The muddiest point technique should be employed regularly by teachers for classroom assessment of the students since it is more effective in improving students’ academic achievement in Mathematics. © 2024 City University of New York.

A successful educational process will be effective if the training provided to students of the transport university is of an acceptable quality, which will lead to a high demand for a specialist. When participating in targeted training programs, the learning process can be optimized and structured within the educational framework, thereby placing emphasis on acquiring the necessary knowledge for future professional endeavors. The objective of the article was to examine how the minor program in the Mathematics discipline for students in targeted programs enhances their professional motivation. We propose to consider the characteristics of training in targeted programs by examining the training of students in the specialty 23.05.04 ""Electric power supply of railways"" at the Samara State University of Railway Transport. We believe that one way to organize the mathematical training of students in targeted programs is to use professionally oriented tasks. As the objective of the study pertains to the issues of specialized university education in the field of mathematics, the paper presents a task that is geared towards professionals for students enrolled in the targeted programs of this particular field. Furthermore, this approach to the study of mathematics yields a comprehensive understanding of one's professional pursuits, implying that the integration of the educational process is essential in the preparation of a railway transport specialist.

The dissociation constant is an empirically determined parameter and cannot be used directly to investigate in silico models of biochemical networks. Here, we develop and present an algorithm to define, compute and assess the relevance of the probable dissociation constant for every reaction of a biochemical network. The reactants and reactions of this network are modelled by a stoichiometry number matrix. The algorithm computes the null space and then serially generates subspaces by combinatorially summing the spanning vectors that are non-trivial and unique. This is done until the terms of each row either monotonically diverge or form an alternating sequence whose terms can be partitioned into subsets with almost the same number of oppositely signed terms. For a selected null space-generated subspace the algorithm utilizes several statistical and mathematical descriptors to select and bin terms from each row into distinct outcome-specific subsets. The terms of each subset are summed, mapped to the real-valued open interval 0,∞ and used to populate a reaction-specific outcome vector. The p1-norm for this vector is then the probable dissociation constant for this reaction. These steps are continued until every reaction of a modelled network is unambiguously annotated. The assertions presented are complemented by computational studies of a biochemical network for aerobic glycolysis. The fundamental premise of this work is that every row of a null space-generated subspace is a valid reaction and can therefore, be modelled as a reaction-specific sequence vector with a dimension that corresponds to the cardinality of the subspace after excluding all trivial- and redundant-vectors. A major finding of this study is that the row-wise sum or the sum of the terms contained in each reaction-specific sequence vector is mapped unambiguously to a positive real number. This means that the probable dissociation constants, for all reactions, can be directly computed from the stoichiometry number matrix and are suitable indicators of outcome for every reaction of the modelled biochemical network. Additionally, we find that the unambiguous annotation for a biochemical network will require a minimum number of iterations and will determine computational complexity. © The Author(s) 2024."

However, the influence of career awareness on STEM career interests is an area that requires further discussion. Evidently, Chinese adolescents have limited awareness and interest in STEM careers in the context of the Chinese cultural milieu, which can potentially constrain their future career trajectories. This study explored the influence of career awareness on the STEM career interests of Chinese high school students, examining the mediating roles of self-efficacy and outcome expectations for STEM courses in this relationship. Additionally, it analyzes the impact of gender on the average levels and interrelations of these variables. A sample of high school students from both eastern and western regions of China (N = 2542) was selected, and data was analyzed using a structural equation modeling approach. Results: The findings indicate that while STEM career awareness impacts various types of STEM career interests, minor differences exist in these effects. Specifically, the influence of STEM career awareness on analytical STEM career interests is entirely mediated by self-efficacy and outcome expectations in STEM courses. However, for life-survival and life-healthy STEM career interests, this mediation is only partial, with respective effects accounting for 39% and 45%. Notably, significant mean-level differences exist between male and female students in STEM career interests and self-efficacy in STEM courses, yet the relationships among these variables remain consistent across genders. Conclusions: This study underscores the pivotal influence of career awareness in molding STEM career interests, shedding light on the mediating functions of self-efficacy and outcome expectations within STEM courses. Through a gender-based analysis, it offers valuable insights into the differing inclinations of male and female high school students in the STEM realm, while also revealing consistent patterns in the relationships among these variables across genders. These findings underscore the necessity for heightened efforts to bolster STEM career awareness and fortify self-efficacy and outcome expectations within STEM courses, particularly in domains characterized by notable gender disparities, aiming to foster equitable advancement within the STEM disciplines. © The Author(s) 2024."

The optimization mathematics model based on Gibbs free energy minimization was established to predict the thermodynamic feasibility of the proposed methanation. To solve the proposed model, the convenient method was implemented by using the Gibbs module in Aspen Plus software. Effects of operation parameters on the methanation performance were revealed to identify the optimized conditions. To reduce the solid carbon concentration, it was found that the optimized conditions of temperature, pressure and stoichiometric number were 650 °C, 30 bar and 3.0, respectively. Moreover, it was discovered that 10 mol% of BFG or BOFG could be mixed into COG to obtain the maximum methane yield. In addition, it was testified that there were the good agreements between calculated results and industrial and published data, which indicated that the proposed methanation was thermodynamically feasible. Therefore, the simple and easy method was developed to evaluate the methanation operating conditions from the aspect of thermodynamic equilibrium, which provided the basic process conditions of byproduct gases methanation to enhance the steel plant efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. © The Author(s) 2024."

They are a source of paradigm shifts in science, mathematics, and engineering. In realistic environments, RT/RM dynamics are often caused by variable accelerations. This work employs the group theory to systematically approach RT/RM dynamics with accelerations varying as power law in time and in space, through the direct link of the governing equations to the momentum model. We identify characteristics of RT dynamics and RM dynamics and RT-to-RM transitions, and investigate symmetries, invariant forms, scaling relations, correlations, fluctuation, and spectra of scale-invariant RT mixing and RM mixing. For accelerations varying in time and in space, we discover special self-similarity classes of RT/RM mixing, and explore attributes of their point and interval sub-classes. Depending upon the accelerations, the scale-invariant RT dynamics can be ballistic, quasi-Kolmogorov, steady flex, and quasi-diffusive; it can also belong to the associated super- and sub-intervals; the scale-invariant RM dynamics is sub-diffusive. For any acceleration, RT/RM mixing retains memory of the deterministic (initial and flow) conditions. These characteristics significantly impact the understanding of RT/RM relevant processes in nature, open perspectives unexplored before for better control of RT/RM instabilities in technology, and advance modeling capabilities of RT/RM dynamics in fluids, plasmas, and materials. © Division of Plasma Physics, Association of Asia Pacific Physical Societies 2024."

The results showed that the ability of most students to make a prediction based on the Covid-19 graph was at a multi-structural level of 35.14%. This level was characterized by students making predictions based on the trends of the pandemic graph patterns, but they tended to overlook the overall patterns.

Grade outcomes in these courses are often disparate across student populations, which, in turn, has implications for student retention. This study positions such disparities as a manifestation of systemic inequities along the dimensions of sex, race/ethnicity, income, and first-generation status and investigates the extent to which they are similar across peer institutions. Results: We examined grade outcomes in a selected set of early STEM courses across six large, public, research-intensive universities in the United States over ten years. In this sample of more than 200,000 STEM course enrollments, we find that course grade benefits increase significantly with the number of systemic advantages students possess at all six institutions. The observed trends in academic outcomes versus advantage are strikingly similar across universities despite the fact that we did not control for differences in grading practices, contexts, and instructor and student populations. The findings are concerning given that these courses are often students’ first post-secondary STEM experiences. Conclusions: STEM course grades are typically lower than those in other disciplines; students taking them often pay grade penalties. The systemic advantages some student groups experience are correlated with significant reductions in these grade penalties at all six institutions. The consistency of these findings across institutions and courses supports the claim that inequities in STEM education are a systemic problem, driven by factors that go beyond specific courses or individual institutions. Our work provides a basis for the exploration of contexts where inequities are exacerbated or reduced and can be used to advocate for structural change within STEM education. To cultivate more equitable learning environments, we must reckon with how pervasive structural barriers in STEM courses negatively shape the experiences of marginalized students. © The Author(s) 2024."

By exhibiting that the system possesses non-negative and bounded global outcomes, it is shown that the approach is both mathematically and biologically practicable. The required conditions are derived, guaranteeing the eradication of the infection. Sensitivity analysis and bifurcation of the submodel are also investigated with system parameters. Furthermore, existence and uniqueness results are established, and the configuration is tested for the existence of an ergodic stationary distribution. For discovering the system’s long-term behavior, a deterministic-probabilistic technique for modeling is designed and operated in MATLAB. By employing an extensive review, we hope that the previously mentioned approach improves and leads to mitigating the two diseases and their co-infections by examining a variety of behavioral trends, such as transitions to unpredictable procedures. In addition, the piecewise differential strategies are being outlined as having promising potential for scholars in a range of contexts because they empower them to include particular characteristics across multiple time frame phases. Such formulas can be strengthened via classical technique, power-law, exponential decay, generalized Mittag–Leffler kernels, probability density functions and random procedures. Furthermore, we get an accurate description of the probability density function encircling a quasi-equilibrium point if the effect of TB and COVID-19 minimizes the propagation of the codynamics. Consequently, scholars can obtain better outcomes when analyzing facts using random perturbations by implementing these strategies for challenging issues. Random perturbations in TB and COVID-19 co-infection are crucial in controlling the spread of an epidemic whenever the suggested circulation is steady and the amount of infection eliminated is closely correlated with the random perturbation level. © The Author(s) 2024."

We draw on the social identity perspective to examine the dynamic inter and intragroup processes entailed in these experiences. In this paper, we report a reflexive thematic analysis of 219 responses to a free-text question on bullying and harassment embedded in a national survey of 40 STEM departments from across the United Kingdom. Most were women (53%) at an early, pre-lectureship career stage. Main findings: Our analysis shows who is the perpetrator and who is the victim is not arbitrary, and neither is the form that it takes; majority group members draw on discourses that warrant the exclusion of minority group members (e.g., women are not smart; incompatibility with religious identity). In this ‘othering’, minority group members learn that one is not regarded as a bona fide STEM academic ingroup member and accordingly are constrained in being able to claim and act on that identity. Thus, it is not just the acts themselves that are problematic, but the ways in which being denied a shared STEM academic identity is consequential for a range of putative benefits and leads to a range of strategies that all confer costs. Conclusions/potential implications: The solution must rest with senior STEM academics and with institutions. First, we need to challenge discourses and practices that narrowly define the boundaries and content of STEM academic identity. Second, all members of a community need to perceive an alignment between the purported values of an organisation for diversity, inclusion, and respect and how that organisation responds when those principles are violated. Formal processes of remedy need to recognise the dynamics entailed in status differences and remove the onus of complaint from isolated, low status individuals. In addition, there is a need to recognise the ways in which perpetrators are embedded in networks of support both within and without the university; and the importance, therefore, of widening the scope of evidence gathering and intervention. © The Author(s) 2024."

This method consists of two main parts. The first part is the proposed incomplete data weighted classification tree algorithm. In the first part, an incomplete data weighted classification tree is proposed, and the incomplete data set is classified using this tree. The data classified in the first part serves as the basis for the second step of the query. The second part proposes a skyline query algorithm for multidimensional incomplete data. The concept of optimal virtual points has been recently introduced, effectively reducing the number of comparisons of a large amount of data, thereby improving the query efficiency for incomplete data.

Attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme is considered a powerful encryption technique that offers flexible and fine-grained access control capabilities. Further, the multi-user collaborative access ABE scheme additionally supports users to acquire access authorization through collaborative works. However, the existing multi-user collaborative access ABE schemes do not consider the different weights of collaboration users. Therefore, using these schemes for weighted multi-user collaborative access results in redundant attributes, which inevitably reduces the efficiency of the ABE scheme. This paper proposes a revocable and verifiable weighted attribute-based encryption with collaborative access scheme (RVWABE-CA), which can provide efficient weighted multi-user collaborative access, user revocation, and data integrity verification, as the fundamental cornerstone for establishing a robust framework to facilitate secure sharing of electronic health records in a public cloud environment. In detail, this scheme employs a novel weighted access tree to eliminate redundant attributes, utilizes encryption version information to control user revocation, and establishes Merkle Hash Tree for data integrity verification. We prove that our scheme is resistant against chosen plaintext attack. The experimental results demonstrate that our scheme has significant computational efficiency advantages compared to related works, without increasing storage or communication overhead. Therefore, the RVWABE-CA scheme can provide an efficient and flexible weighted collaborative access control and user revocation mechanism as well as data integrity verification for electronic health record systems. © The Author(s) 2024."

The stochastic Burgers’ equation plays an important role in the fields of applied mathematics such as fluid dynamics, gas dynamics, traffic flow, and nonlinear acoustics. This study is presented the existence, approximate, and exact stochastic solitary wave results. The existence of results is shown by the help of Schauder fixed point theorem. For the approximate results the proposed stochastic finite difference scheme is constructed. The analysis of the proposed scheme is analyzed by presented the consistency and stability of scheme. The consistency is checked under the mean square sense while the stability condition is gained by the help of Von-Neumann criteria. Meanwhile, the stochastic exact solutions are constructed by using the generalized exponential rational function method. These exact stochastic solutions are obtained in the form of hyperbolic, trigonometric and exponential functions. Mainly, the comparison of both numerical and exact solutions are analyzed via simulations. The unique physical problems are constructed from the newly constructed soliton solutions to compare the numerical results with exact solutions under the presence of randomness.

Enumerating the numbers of mismatches, being indicators of mutation, has been central to pertinent algorithms. Specific amino acids possess quantifiable characteristics that enable the conversion from “words” (strings of letters denoting amino acids or bases) to “waves” (strings of quantitative values representing the physico-chemical properties) or to matrices (coordinates representing the positions in a comprehensive property space). The application of such numerical representations to evolutionary analysis takes into account not only the occurrence of mutations but also their properties as influences that drive speciation, because selective pressures favor certain mutations over others, and this predilection is represented in the characteristics of the incorporated amino acids (it is not born out solely by the mismatches). Besides being more discriminating sources for tree-generating algorithms than match/mismatch, the number strings can be examined for overall similarity with average mutual information, autocorrelation, and fractal dimension. Bivariate wavelet analysis aids in distinguishing hypermutable versus conserved domains of the protein. The matrix depiction is readily subjected to comparisons of distances, and it allows the generation of heat maps or graphs. This analysis preserves the accepted taxa order where tree construction with standard approaches yields conflicting results (for the protein S100A6). It also aids hypothesis generation about the origin of mitochondrial proteins. These analytical algorithms have been automated in R and are applicable to various processes that are describable in matrix format. © 2024"

Tree-LSTM could improve the parallel speed of LSTM, and incorporate relevant information from dependency or syntax trees. Tree-LSTM can update gate and memory vectors from the multiple sub-units. Learning edge features can strengthen the expression ability of graph neural networks. However, the original Child-Sum Tree-LSTMs ignores edge features during aggregating the sub-nodes hidden states. To enhance node representation, we propose an interaction mechanism that can alternately updating nodes and edges vectors, thus the model can learn the richer nodes vectors. The interaction mechanism attaches the node embedding to its connected link at the first stage. Next, it superimposes the updated edge into the parent node once more. Repeat the above steps from bottom to top. We present five strategies during the alternant renewal process. Meanwhile, we adopt one constituent parser and one dependency parser to produce the diversified formats, and compare their performances in the experiment result. The proposed model achieves better performance than baseline methods on the BioNLP'09 and MLEE corpuses. The experimental results show that the simple event results are almost identical for each parser. But for complex events, Stanford Parser is better than MaltParser because of more frequent interactive behaviors.

There are millions of users on these networks, and they generate a great deal of interaction among them. Network sampling is often used to study and measure OSNs, which produce a small, accessible network with a limited number of edges and nodes. In this paper, two algorithms are proposed to sample OSNs. The first algorithm finds several spanning trees with the highest number of nodes that satisfy a given degree constraint from randomly chosen root nodes; edges and nodes of computed spanning trees are ranked based on how often they appear in them. Finally, a fraction of the highly ranked nodes and edges are considered in the sampled network. Second, a partial spanning tree algorithm is proposed in place of a full spanning tree algorithm to improve the performance of the first algorithm.

In this research work, the modified Sardar sub-equation approach is employed to find the soliton solutions of (1+1)-dimensional time-fractional coupled nonlinear Schrödinger model with Beta fractional derivative. These models are fundamental in real-world applications such as control systems, processing of signals, and fiber optic networks. By using this strategy, we are able to obtain various unique optical solutions, including combo, dark, bright, periodic, singular, and rational wave solutions. In addition, We address the sensitivity analysis of the proposed model to investigate the truth that it is extremely sensitive. These studies are novel and have not been performed before in relation to the nonlinear dynamic features of these solutions. We show these behaviors in 2-D, contour 3-D structures across the associated physical characteristics. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach offers useful results for producing solutions of nonlinear fractional models in application of mathematics and wave propagation in fiber optics. © The Author(s) 2024."

The study also considers student-level (e.g., mathematics self-efficacy, gender, race/ethnicity) and school-level (e.g., school location, proportion of underrepresented students) demographics to provide a comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to mathematics achievement gaps. Methods: A two-level cross-sectional multilevel modeling approach was employed to analyze the variance in mathematics achievement, partitioning it into within- and between-school components. This approach allowed for an examination of association between mathematics self-efficacy and achievement gaps while considering various student and school characteristics. The rationale behind this methodology lies in its ability to capture the hierarchical nature of educational data and provide a nuanced understanding of the factors associated with mathematics achievement. Results: The analysis of the NAEP data revealed substantial variability in mathematics achievement across schools in the United States at all grade levels. Furthermore, mathematics self-efficacy emerged as a robust predictor of students' mathematics achievement, exhibiting significant effect sizes for Grades 4, 8, and 12. Remarkably, when students' mathematics self-efficacy was held constant, the mathematics achievement gaps among different student subgroups by gender, race/ethnicity, ELL, IEP, NSLP status narrowed, highlighting the importance of self-efficacy in addressing these disparities. The study also identified the presence of significant school contextual effects, further emphasizing the role of the educational environment in shaping mathematics achievement. Conclusions: This study underscores the critical role of mathematics self-efficacy in influencing mathematics achievement gaps among students. By acknowledging the association between self-efficacy beliefs and mathematics achievement, policymakers and educators can develop targeted interventions to enhance students' confidence and motivation in mathematics, ultimately promoting equitable educational outcomes. The findings also emphasize the significance of school-level factors, calling for comprehensive approaches that consider both individual and contextual factors in narrowing achievement gaps. The implications of adopting a self-efficacy perspective to address mathematics achievement gaps extend to educational policy, curriculum development, and instructional practices, ultimately fostering more inclusive and effective mathematics education for all students. © The Author(s) 2024."

First, stratification variables that achieve a high between and low within strata variance can improve the efficiency of a survey design. Second, stratification allows one to, explicitly or implicitly, control for sample sizes across subpopulations. It ensures that some parts of a population are in the sample in predetermined proportions. In this study, we determine through simulation which stratification scheme is best for PISA in Germany. For this, we consider the constraints imposed by the international sampling design, the available information about schools, and specific national characteristics of the German educational system. We examine seven different stratification designs selected based on scenarios used in past LSAs in Germany and theoretical considerations for future implementations. The chosen scenarios were compared with two reference scenarios: (1) an unstratified design and (2) a synthetic optimal stratification design. The simulation study reveals that the stratification design currently applied in PISA produces satisfactory results regarding sampling precision. The present stratification design is based on Germany's federal states and school types. However, this approach leads to small strata, which has been problematic for estimating sampling variance in previous cycles. Therefore, alternative stratification scenarios were considered and, in addition to overcoming the small-strata problem, also led to smaller standard errors for estimates of student mean performance in mathematics, science, and reading. As a result of this study, we recommend considering three different stratification designs for Germany in future cycles of PISA. These recommendations aim to: (1) improve the sampling efficiency while keeping the sample size constant, (2) follow a sound methodological approach, and (3) make conservative and cautious changes while maintaining a reflection of the structure of the German federal school system with different school types. These suggestions include a reinvented stratification of grouped German federal states and designs with school types as explicit stratifiers and federal states as implicit stratifiers. © The Author(s) 2024."

The algorithm draws on the randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD), and operates under the assumption that methods for rapidly applying A and A∗ to vectors are available. The algorithm uses graph coloring algorithms to analyze the hierarchical tree that defines the rank structure to generate a tailored probability distribution from which to draw the random test matrices. The matrix is then applied to the test matrices, and in a final step the matrix itself is reconstructed by the observed input–output pairs. The method presented is an evolution of the “peeling algorithm” of Lin et al. (2011). For the case of uniform trees, the new method substantially reduces the pre-factor of the original peeling algorithm. More significantly, the new technique leads to dramatic acceleration for many non-uniform trees since it constructs test matrices that are optimized for a given tree. The algorithm is particularly effective for kernel matrices involving a set of points restricted to a lower dimensional object than the ambient space, such as a boundary integral equation defined on a surface in three dimensions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

There is little research to explore the inner relationships between common syndromes, such as depression and burnout. Network analysis (NA) was a novel approach to quantified the correlations between mental variables from the perspective of mathematics. This study was to investigate the interactions between burnout and depression symptoms through NA among ICU nurses. Method: A cross-sectional study with a total of 616 Chinese nurses in ICU were carried out by convenience sampling from December 19, 2022 to January19, 2023 via online survey. Burnout symptoms were measured by Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS) (Chinese version), and depressive symptoms were assessed by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). NA was applied to build interactions between burnout and depression symptoms. We identified central and bridge symptoms by R package qgraph in the network model. R package bootnet was used to examined the stability of network structure. Results: The prevalence of burnout and depressive symptoms were 48.2% and 64.1%, respectively. Within depression-burnout network, PHQ4(Fatigue)-MBI2(Used up) and PHQ4(Fatigue)-MBI5(Breakdown) showed stronger associations. MBI2(Used up) had the strongest expected influence central symptoms, followed by MBI4(Stressed) and MBI7 (Less enthusiastic). For bridge symptoms. PHQ4(Fatigue), MBI5(Breakdown) and MBI2(Used up) weighed highest. Both correlation stability coefficients of central and bridge symptoms in the network structure were 0.68, showing a high excellent level of stability. Conclusion: The symptom of PHQ4(Fatigue) was the bridge to connect the emotion exhaustion and depression. Targeting this symptom will be effective to detect mental disorders and relieve mental syndromes of ICU nurses at the late stage of COVID-19 pandemic. © The Author(s) 2024."

This project's aim is to replicate the design of a previous study by expanding further into exploring the gender stereotypes’ relationships for two traditionally gendered polarised areas of study: Engineering and Nursing/Midwifery and assessing participants’ earlier experiences in their secondary education. Survey participants were Engineering and Nursing/Midwifery students (N=161) of a university in Ireland. Results came positive for stereotypical biases in favour to men in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), and specifically for Mathematics. Stereotypes emerged stronger among the female participants. While comparing the two genders within each of the two study areas, significant differences emerge among the female Nursing/Midwifery and female Engineering participants. Female Engineering participants appear with stronger preference, attitude and importance towards STEM than their Nursing/Midwifery counterparts. Nevertheless, Mathematics is an indicator subject for success in higher education and the need to strengthen critical thinking, evidenced based practice and quality of quantitative research in female dominated areas such as Nursing/Midwifery has been recognised. In addition to identified stereotypes, differences in respondents’ views/elements of their interaction with STEM were associated with the type of secondary school they attended. Further research is recommended on traits that could contribute to the formation of gender biased stereotypes in single and mixed gender education systems with an aim to reverse them. © 2024"

While digital tools have gained access to pedagogical spheres, physical activity has been overlooked, as pupils often engage in activities that require minimal bodily movement. In this article, we discuss pupils’ experiences with learning through an augmented reality (AR)-based game application and explain how the application supports embodied learning. Digital tools, including gaming, can supplement traditional activities, motivate children to become physically active and enhance their learning experiences. Integrating technology and physical activity can create a more varied, meaningful, and dynamic school day, positively supporting pupils’ learning processes. The AR game associated with this study facilitated physical activity and learning experiences through a mobile device application. The empirical material for the study includes interviews with pupils participating in an AR game in mathematics. The findings show that participating in an AR game promoted embodied learning and positively impacted pupils’ motivation, engagement and learning processes. More specifically, AR facilitated learners’ engagement in the learning process by fostering their active involvement through physical and social collaboration and by enhancing the pupils’ joy of learning. Additionally, the pupils expressed that they enjoyed the application’s variations and the experiences that followed working collaboratively with the tasks. Moreover, they commonly found the physical and collaborative components of the AR game exciting and academically motivating. Studies on AR games and technology focusing on the opportunities and pedagogical foundations for their use in education are relevant in these precarious times. Indeed, more knowledge is needed on the ways creative and flexible learning processes that transpire within a technological learning environment influence embodied learning, knowledge that is essential for designing teaching and learning in the technical future. © The Author(s) 2024."

However, there remains a relative dearth of investigation into the factors that contribute to the success of STEM education programs integrating communal goals. In the present study, we sought to explore the roles of two constructs that prioritize the interests of others, namely empathy and citizenship, in promoting STEM learning perseverance within the context of a STEM-based community service learning (CSL) program. Specifically, we proposed that empathy would be associated with STEM learning perseverance through its relationship with citizenship, within a sample of 275 secondary school students from Hong Kong who participated in the said program. Results: Using structural equation modeling (SEM), the results revealed that empathy is significantly and positively associated with STEM learning perseverance, both directly and indirectly, through citizenship. The results held even after controlling for the demographic variables of school membership, gender, and age. Conclusions: This research highlights the association between understanding the needs of the community (empathy) and students' desire for community involvement (citizenship), which subsequently influences their perseverance in STEM learning.

However, due to the differences in human characteristics and the strength of protective measures, different people have different symptoms in air pollution and viral infection environments. In this paper, an SI1I2P dynamic model of respiratory diseases infected by virus under air pollution is established by introducing air pollutant concentration compartment. Qualitative research shows that there are seven equilibria in the system, the daily average emission and clearance rate of pollutants are the key parameters affecting the existence and stability of equilibria. In this paper, by using Sotomayor's theorem and center manifold theory, it is proved that the system undergoes saddle–node bifurcation or Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation of co-dimension 3 at the boundary equilibrium, and exhibits saddle–node bifurcation at the endemic equilibrium. Numerical simulation results show that wearing masks in haze weather can not only reduce the number of allergic patients, but also reduce the number of viral patients. In addition, reducing the daily average emission of air pollution and increasing its clearance rate can also reduce the number of allergic patients.

However, it is a challenge to enable the thick-panel forms of such crease patterns to bifurcate uniquely and reliably into desired modes. Here, thick-panel theory combined with cuts is applied to a stacked origami tube with multiple bifurcation paths. The thick-panel form corresponding to the stacked origami tube is constructed, which can bifurcate exactly between two desired modes without falling into other bifurcation paths. Then, kinematic analysis is carried out, and the results reveal that the thick-panel origami tube is kinematically equivalent to its zero-thickness form with one degree-of-freedom (DOF). In addition, a reconfigurable physical prototype of the thick-panel origami tube is produced, which achieves reliable bifurcation control through a single actuator. Such thick-panel origami tubes with controllable reconfigurability have great potential engineering applications in the fields of morphing systems such as mechanical metamaterials, morphing wings, and deployable structures. © 2024 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

A good solving process will produce an excellent solving ability. The existing problem-solving stages cannot be used in solving problems with the Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) category. The aims of this research are 1). to know students' problem-solving process in solving HOTS category questions; 2). To design the stages of problem-solving that can be used to solve HOTS category questions. Twenty-four students who took the differential calculus course in mathematics education at one of Indonesia's private universities made up the study group. The solving process is divided into high, medium, and low. The descriptive and qualitative research method describes the Polya stages' problem-solving approach. Researchers used four sets of problem-solving by making nine indicators. Based on the analysis results, it can be concluded that several indicators of the problem-solving stages have not been appropriately implemented, including I4, I8, and I9. In addition, the steps at the Polya problem-solving stage of devising a plan and looking back must be improved. Based on the findings above, research recommendations design the stages of problem-solving consisting of 6 steps.

Quantum computing quantum Monte Carlo (QC-QMC) is a QMC with a trial state prepared in quantum circuit, which is employed to obtain the ground state with higher accuracy than QMC alone. We propose an algorithm combining QC-QMC with a hybrid tensor network to extend the applicability of QC-QMC beyond a single quantum device size. In a two-layer quantum-quantum tree tensor, our algorithm for the larger trial wave function can be executed than preparable wave function in a device. Our algorithm is evaluated on the Heisenberg chain model, graphite-based Hubbard model, hydrogen plane model, and MonoArylBiImidazole using full configuration interaction QMC. Our algorithm can achieve energy accuracy (specifically, variance) several orders of magnitude higher than QMC, and the hybrid tensor version of QMC gives the same energy accuracy as QC-QMC when the system is appropriately decomposed. Moreover, we develop a pseudo-Hadamard test technique that enables efficient overlap calculations between a trial wave function and an orthonormal basis state. In a real device experiment by using the technique, we obtained almost the same accuracy as the statevector simulator, indicating the noise robustness of our algorithm. These results suggests that the present approach will pave the way to electronic structure calculation for large systems with high accuracy on current quantum devices. © The Author(s) 2024."

When different industrial control systems merge with the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, they become vulnerable to cyber-attacks in critical infrastructure situations requiring communication technologies. Conventional machine learning techniques used for network anomaly detection are ineffective due to the substantial amount of network traffic within important Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). In this manuscript, Cyberattack Identification Through Ensemble Deep Learning in an IoT environment is proposed. Initially, the input network traffic data are taken from the IoT-23 dataset. Then the network traffic data are preprocessed using Z-Score normalization to reduce any irrelevant or erroneous data from the input dataset. Then the relevant features are selected using the Gorilla Troops Optimization (GTO) algorithm. Afterwards, the selected features are fed into the ensemble classification model based on Random Space (RS), Random Tree (RT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN). Among the several ensembling techniques, GCNN can achieve better performance. Python is used to accomplish the suggested technique. The performance of the proposed GCNN method provides 12.09%, 4.34%, and 3.21% higher accuracy than the other models like RS, RT and XGBoost respectively. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

This degradation results in significant alterations to both the appearance and material properties of PLMs, but the precise mechanism underlying this deterioration remains a mystery. To this end, the present study focused on ancient PLMs from Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, China. The objective of present study was to isolate, culture and identify the microorganisms typically found in these manuscripts and to use them to biodegrade the carriers of PLMs. Detailed observations of the biodegradation behavior of these microorganisms on the carriers of PLMs were carried out, together with characterizations of the hierarchical structure and mechanical properties of the leaf fiber cell walls. This comprehensive analysis provided insights into the deterioration mechanisms of the carriers of PLMs. The study revealed the presence of the common fungus Aspergillus niger on ancient PLMs. Aspergillus niger can secrete cellulase, lipase, and acidic substances after colonizing on the carriers of PLMs. These substances sequentially damage the carrier's epidermal cells, mesophyll cells, and leaf fibers, leading to the separation of different tissue structures. At the molecular level, the lipids on the surface of the leaves were degraded initially, and sequential depolymerization of hemicellulose, amorphous cellulose, and crystalline cellulose occurred. Additionally, this study firstly applied nanoindentation technology in the research of PLMs. The mechanical properties of the cell walls underwent notable alterations due to the modifications in chemical and crystalline structure of the carriers of PLMs upon the biodegradation of Aspergillus niger. Specifically, the hardness and elastic modulus of leaf fiber cell walls showed an initial increasing and then decreasing trend, consistent with the trend of cellulose crystallinity, which also provided a new reference for assessing the degree of deterioration of PLMs. © The Author(s) 2024."

Similar materials use cement and Plaster as binders and quartz sand as aggregate. The sensitivity of similar indicators of similar materials to control factors was analyzed through range statistics. Multiple regression analysis was used to establish the quantitative relationship between each control factor and similar indicators. Finally, the optimal matching scheme was refined through the combination of fuzzy mathematics and analytic hierarchy process. The results show that the physical and mechanical property indicators of similar materials with different proportions have a wide distribution range, and under certain similar conditions, they can meet the requirements of rock model tests with different properties. The aggregate-binder ratio is a direct indicator of material density, elastic modulus, and compressive strength. The main controlling factors, material density, elastic modulus, and compressive strength all increase with the decrease in aggregate-binder ratio. The cement-plaster ratio is the main control factor of material water absorption, and the water absorption gradually decreases with the increase of the cement-plaster ratio. The formula obtained through linear analysis can better represent the changing trend and distribution characteristics of various parameters of similar materials with the aggregate-binder ratio and cement-plaster ratio, and initially optimize the proportioning scheme of similar materials.

The guiding question is the cognitive potential of the tasks with regard to the general mathematical competences, the basic ideas involved, and the digital tools used. Fourteen Abitur tasks with 203 work assignments were considered from the task pool of the Institute for Educational Quality Improvement (IQB), in which exemplary Abitur tasks are publicly available as orientation within the framework of the Central Abitur. Specifically, tasks in the domain of calculus from the years 2020 and 2021 were included in the study. A coding manual based on the COACTIV manual was developed for the analysis and supplemented with criteria regarding the use of digital media. The coding manual can also be used in the future as an instrument for task and quality development processes in upper secondary education. As a result of the study, there was a generally low level of cognitive potential in all general mathematical competencies examined, e.g. in argumentation, problem solving, modelling, and communication (i.e., text writing). Moreover, the tasks addressed “Grundvorstellungen” only to a very limited extent. There were hardly any differences between the tasks with different digital tools (computer algebra (CAS) and scientific calculator), which means that the potentials of CAS were rarely used.

Algorithms to learn directed acyclic graphs from system data are powerful, but they often result in too many possible causal structures that cannot be properly evaluated. Results: An approach to this problem proposed here is to initially restrict the system to a target variable with its two major drivers. Subsequently, testable causal structures are obtained from rules to infer directed acyclic graphs and expert knowledge. The proposed approach, which is essentially based on correlation and regression, was applied to understand drivers of a toxic algal bloom in the Odra River in summer 2022.

This is presumably explained by the effect of family SES on cognitive and socioemotional abilities associated with academic achievement. Metacognition which refers to knowledge and regulation skills involving reflexivity about one's own cognitive processes is one of these abilities. However, most of the studies investigating the association between metacognition and academic achievement have focused on school-aged students and studies with younger students are only emerging. Meanwhile, the association between family SES and metacognition abilities has surprisingly received little attention regardless of participants’ age. The aim of this study was to explore the associations between family SES, metacognition, language and mathematical abilities in preschoolers aged 5 to 6. We provide the first evidence that the effect of family SES on preschoolers’ language and mathematical abilities is mediated by the effect of family SES on their metacognitive abilities.

In this study, a singer identification application, which consists of Turkish singers and works for the Turkish language, is proposed in order to find a solution to this problem. Mel-spectrogram and octave-based spectral contrast values are extracted from the songs, and these values are combined into a hybrid feature vector. Thus, problem-specific situations such as determining the differences in the voices of the singers and reducing the effects of the year and album differences on the result are discussed. As a result of the tests and systematic evaluations, it has been shown that a certain level of success has been achieved in the determination of the singer who sings the song, and that the song is in a stable structure against the changes in the singing style and song structure. The results were analyzed in a database of 9 singers and 180 songs.

Given the high level of expectations for professional development, it is crucial to identify the characteristics of effective teacher professional development. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review of professional development interventions for mathematics teachers. We sought to identify the characteristics of interventions with positive and statistically significant effects on students’ mathematics achievement. Our review includes 12 professional development interventions which included elements of structured pedagogy intervention (i.e., teacher training, on-site teacher support, and resources for teachers and students), in addition to initial professional development and follow-up workshops. Utilizing technology has proved to be beneficial for student learning, but less so for teacher learning. The results of the reviewed studies indicate that changes in instruction can be implemented incrementally, beginning with less complex interventions and progressing to those that are more complex and demanding. Furthermore, we conclude that professional development interventions that seek to improve student learning outcomes in mathematics should include on-site teacher support, mentoring and feedback, teacher-focused resources, and classroom learning materials. © 2024 City University of New York.

In recent studies, it has been found that Asian students use combined learning strategies, primarily including metacognitive strategies, rather than rote memorization. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is only one prior study including South Korea in investigations of the relationship between learning strategies and mathematics achievement in PISA 2012. In that study, students were classified into groups using specific learning strategies, and their mathematics achievements were compared. There are two research gaps: (1) previous studies insufficiently explored how students use learning strategies in the South Korean education system, and (2) there is little research applying the nominal response model (NRM) to explore the association between learning strategy use and mathematics achievement in PISA 2012. Thus, the present study explores to what extent the NRM fits the data compared to the generalized partial credit model (GPCM). We created a learning strategy score from the NRM for South Korean students in PISA 2012 (N = 3,310). Then, using correlation analysis and quadratic regression analysis, we identified linear and nonlinear relations between learning strategy scores from the NRM and mathematics achievement. The findings indicated that (1) NRM was a better fit for creating learning strategy scores than GPCM, (2) the average correlation coefficient between the learning strategy score and mathematics achievement was 0.18 (p <.05), and (3) for the curvilinear relationship between the learning strategy score and mathematics achievement, the standardized quadratic coefficient was − 0.090 (p <.001). Overall, the NRM represents an appropriate model for explaining the relationship between learning strategy and mathematical achievement. Additionally, high-performing South Korean students tend to primarily use metacognitive strategies with memorization. The negative quadratic coefficient captured the limited effect of the primary use of metacognitive strategies with memorization. The implications for the South Korean education system are discussed. © The Author(s) 2024."

It is therefore important to understand the factors influencing students’ persistence in STEM fields, and what STEM belonging means from the voices of socio-demographically diverse students, in order to ensure equity among students in STEM fields and to increase their belonging to this field, which has not been clearly defined in the literature, and there is a lack of agreement about the definition of belonging itself. For this purpose, the perspectives of students in England are brought together in this study in an attempt to better understand the concept of STEM belonging within a broader context of integration. Result: The inductive thematic analysis with the voices of socio-demographically diverse 313 A-level, undergraduate and postgraduate Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry students showed that compared to male students, it was mostly female, non-binary, non-White, and first-generation students who defined STEM belonging as ‘Feeling safe and comfortable in the STEM community and settings’. This theme was defined by the participants as the group/community/learning environment in which the individual belongs, the interaction with the people in the field, and the comfort that this participation/interaction creates. Students stressed the importance of creating a supportive and welcoming STEM environment so that individuals can feel at home, as well as a safe and comfortable STEM environment for people of all identities, genders, ethnicities, and backgrounds. Based on the participants’ responses, this study also conceptualised the concept of STEM belonging as having four phases: the ‘adaptation phase’, the ‘integration phase’, the ‘continuum phase’, and the ‘transition phase’. These four phases which comprise the STEM belonging concept are consecutive and interconnected. Conclusion: The study concluded that all human beings are connected in a relational way (either strong or weak) and that the concept of STEM belonging develops as a result of interactions with ‘self’ and ‘others’ who have a shared passion and an interest in STEM fields. Although individuals have intrinsic motivation and individual prompts in STEM fields (i.e. resilience, beliefs in their capacity/ability and curiosity, etc.), social determinants (i.e. receiving adequate support from members of the STEM community, social capital and social cohesion, etc.) also play a significant role in influencing individual’s sense of STEM belonging. © The Author(s) 2024."

Accurately evaluating the health level of the ecological environment helps to develop reasonable strategies for ecological environment restoration and resource management. This paper constructed a comprehensive evaluation index system based on the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) framework and evaluated the ecological health of eleven administrative regions in the Wei River Basin (WRB), northwest China in 1980, 2000, and 2020 using an evaluation model established by fuzzy mathematics. Further, obstacle degrees were used to quantify the contribution of pressure, state, and response modules, as well as individual indicators to ecological health. Results: The comprehensive evaluation system constructed based on the PSR framework could effectively reflect the ecological health conditions of different regions in the WRB. During the study period, the ecological health went through a process of first deterioration and then improvement. By 2020, the ecological health of seven administrative regions reached healthy levels. The state module was the main obstacle module of the PSR framework to the ecological health of the most regions. The population density (P1), patch density of construction land (S5), comprehensive elasticity index (S8), soil erosion index (R1), and per capital GDP (R3) were the most crucial individual indicators affecting the ecological health. For different cities, the main obstacle factors varied. In economically developed cities, the limiting effect of P1 was more significant, while in economically underdeveloped cities, the limiting effect of R3 was stronger. Conclusions: In response to the special natural environment and socio-economic conditions of arid and semi-arid areas in the WRB, an ecological health evaluation index system suitable for the characteristics of the basin was constructed. The results indicated that, to improve the levels of urban ecological health, it is necessary to restore the natural ecological environment and control population size while accelerating economic construction. Our results can provide scientific support for the ecological health evaluation and protection of the WRB and even the arid and semi-arid areas in northwest China. © The Author(s) 2024."

Significant progress has been made in code recommendation for static languages in recent years, but it remains challenging for dynamic languages like Python as accurately determining data flows before runtime is difficult. This limitation hinders data flow analysis, affecting the performance of code recommendation methods that rely on code analysis. In this study, a graph-based Python recommendation approach (GraphPyRec) is proposed by converting source code into a graph representation that captures both semantic and dynamic information. Nodes represent semantic information, with unique rules defined for various code statements. Edges depict control flow and data flow, utilizing a child-sibling-like process and a dedicated algorithm for data transfer extraction. Alongside the graph, a bag of words is created to include essential names, and a pre-trained BERT model transforms it into vectors. These vectors are integrated into a Gated Graph Neural Network (GGNN) process of the code recommendation model, enhancing its effectiveness and accuracy. To validate the proposed method, we crawled over a million lines of code from GitHub. Experimental results show that GraphPyRec outperforms existing mainstream Python code recommendation methods, achieving Top-1, 5, and 10 accuracy rates of 68.52%, 88.92%, and 94.05%, respectively, along with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.772. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Results: Analyzing 142 peer-reviewed articles, we ascertain shared definitions and concepts in patient and public involvement and public engagement, identifying key differences and similarities. Conclusion: The literature we review supports the notion that, in terms of origins, there are two distinct traditions, one based in science communication and one based in what we describe as public involvement in shared decision-making.

However, sequencers may produce low-quality bases, leading to ambiguous bases, ‘N’s. PCR duplicates introduced in library preparation are conventionally removed in genomics studies, and several deduplication tools have been developed for this purpose. Two identical reads may appear different due to ambiguous bases and the existing tools cannot address ‘N’s correctly or efficiently. Results: Here we proposed and implemented TrieDedup, which uses the trie (prefix tree) data structure to compare and store sequences. TrieDedup can handle ambiguous base ‘N’s, and efficiently deduplicate at the level of raw sequences. We also reduced its memory usage by approximately 20% by implementing restrictedDict in Python. We benchmarked the performance of the algorithm and showed that TrieDedup can deduplicate reads up to 270-fold faster than pairwise comparison at a cost of 32-fold higher memory usage. Conclusions: The TrieDedup algorithm may facilitate PCR deduplication, barcode or UMI assignment, and repertoire diversity analysis of large-scale high-throughput sequencing datasets with its ultra-fast algorithm that can account for ambiguous bases due to sequencing errors. © The Author(s) 2024."

This would explain the high HbS gene frequency observed in certain regions hyperendemic for malaria, so-called “malaria hypothesis”. This in silico study was conducted to examine the feasibility of the hypothesis under more realistic initial conditions, where a mutant gene with heterozygous advantage against malaria (e.g., HbS) was introduced in a group of Neolithic hunter-gatherers who decided to start agriculture nearby water where malaria killed a proportion of population. The tribe population size, number of children born to each woman in each generation, mortality from malaria and sickle cell disease, the protection factor provided by the gene carriers against malaria, the probability of mating between the members of the parent and offspring populations, population growth, and increased fertility in women heterozygous for HbS, were also considered. For effectively confer protection against malaria within the shortest possible period, the mutation needs to be happened in a small population. For a large population, the process would take around 100 generations (~ 2500 years) or more to provide an effective protection. Even then, the probability that the new gene could survive and propagate to future generations is about 35%. Conventional population genetics equations with differential or difference equations, give totally incorrect estimates of the gene frequency in small populations; discrete mathematics should be used, instead. After introduction of the advantageous mutation, the gene frequency increased until a steady state value. This value is far less than the gene frequency reported in certain tribes of Africa. It seems that the malaria hypothesis, per se, could not explain such a high observed gene frequency, unless HbS is associated with lower mortality from other causes too. © The Author(s) 2024."

Mathematical connections, one of the essential and hot topics advocated in mathematics education, have been emphasized in national curriculum reforms in various countries. However, little is known about the connection networks represented in school textbooks; even less has been done to compare textbooks from different countries. In this study, we propose an innovative method for examining how connections are represented in two popular U.S. (the UCSMP series) and Chinese (the PEP-A series) high school textbook problems involving quadratic relations. By using social network analysis, we identified 1129 connections, characterized connection networks into dense, moderate, and sparse digraphs, identified influential, prominent, and dual concepts and representations, and evaluated the strength between typical and reverse connections. The results revealed that the Chinese series presented a denser network of balanced between-concept connections but limited within-concept connections. The U.S. series exhibited more within-concept connections but emphasized typical connections, thus validating the potential of this innovative method. From this study, we suggest that our novel method provides a theoretical contribution to textbook analysis and connection analysis, which has rich implications for practice, for example, examining the network of connections students construct as a way to assess and to promote their conceptual understanding, and our approach opens the possibility of adopting new and efficient analytical tools from social network analysis in mathematics education research. © The Author(s) 2024."

How these issues relate to math anxiety is also explored. The above is examined on a sample of university students in the selected education institution (HEI) N =297 in the Czech Republic in 2022. Subsequently, a series of semi-structured interviews were conducted with the students in 2023. It was found that by improving work-related skills for a future career, math anxiety increases. A crucial finding is up to 47 % of the perceived importance of competencies for future job performance can be explained by understanding the importance of mathematics for their acquisition. The findings of this study have the potential to contribute to the improvement of mathematics education and the development of a more skilled and capable workforce, which can ultimately lead to greater economic growth and social progress.

For example, cells exposed to different concentrations of drugs, such as cells located near the vessels in contrast to those residing far from the vasculature, can undergo a different evolutionary path. However, classical representations of cell lineage trees do not account for this spatial component of emerging cancer clones. Here, we propose routines to trace spatial and temporal clonal evolution in computer simulations of the tumor evolution models. Results: The LinG3D (Lineage Graphs in 3D) is an open-source collection of routines (in MATLAB, Python, and R) that enables spatio-temporal visualization of clonal evolution in a two-dimensional tumor slice from computer simulations of the tumor evolution models. These routines draw traces of tumor clones in both time and space, and may include a projection of a selected microenvironmental factor, such as the drug or oxygen distribution within the tumor, if such a microenvironmental factor is used in the tumor evolution model. The utility of LinG3D has been demonstrated through examples of simulated tumors with different number of clones and, additionally, in experimental colony growth assay. Conclusions: This routine package extends the classical lineage trees, that show cellular clone relationships in time, by adding the space component to show the locations of cellular clones within the 2D tumor tissue patch from computer simulations of tumor evolution models. © The Author(s) 2024."

The studies of ABSA mainly focus on the attention-based approaches and the graph neural network approaches based on dependency trees. However, the attention-based methods usually face difficulties in capturing long-distance syntactic dependencies. Additionally, existing approaches using graph neural networks have not made sufficient exploit the syntactic dependencies among aspects and opinions. In this paper, we propose a novel Syntactic Dependency Graph Convolutional Network (SD-GCN) model for ABSA. We employ the Biaffine Attention to model the sentence syntactic dependencies and build syntactic dependency graphs from aspects and emotional words. This allows our SD-GCN to learn both the semantic relationships of aspects and the overall semantic meaning. According to these graphs, the long-distance syntactic dependency relationships are captured by GCNs, which facilitates SD-GCN to capture the syntactic dependencies between aspects and viewpoints more comprehensively, and consequently yields enhanced aspect features. We conduct extensive experiments on four aspect-level sentiment datasets. The experimental results show that our SD-GCN outperforms other methodologies. Moreover, ablation experiments and visualization of attention further substantiate the effectiveness of SD-GCN. © The Author(s) 2024."

The presence of defects theoretically enriches the structure of the CFT, but at the same time, it makes it more challenging to study, especially in dimensions higher than two. Here, we demonstrate that the recently-developed theoretical scheme, fuzzy (non-commutative) sphere regularization, provides a powerful lens through which one can dissect the defect of 3D CFTs in a transparent way. As a notable example, we study the magnetic line defect of 3D Ising CFT and clearly demonstrate that it flows to a conformal defect fixed point. We have identified 6 low-lying defect primary operators, including the displacement operator, and accurately extract their scaling dimensions through the state-operator correspondence. Moreover, we also compute one-point bulk correlators and two-point bulk-defect correlators, which show great agreement with predictions of defect conformal symmetry, and from which we extract various bulk-defect operator product expansion coefficients.

Survey data were collected in five schools across one U.S. urban school district at two time points (spring 2018 [n = 197] and spring 2019 [n = 210]). Based on extant research regarding psychological response patterns to racialized school stress, we investigated the existence of an identity negotiation pattern in which students were motivated to resist negative stereotypes about Black people by achieving well in mathematics. We conducted a latent profile analysis combining students’ self-beliefs across five indicators: racial centrality, racial public regard, mathematics attainment value, mathematics mastery experiences, and resistance motivation. Three distinct racial-mathematical identity profiles emerged: (1) Mathematics Devalued/Ambivalent, (2) Moderately Math Attained, and (3) Resistors. We found associations between profile membership and students’ gender, negative math emotions, and their receipt of cultural and critical mathematics instruction. We also found an association between the identity profiles and school type (academically selective “magnet” schools vs. open-enrollment neighborhood schools), but not in the direction that might be assumed. Moreover, we found that certain school environment factors (i.e., racial stereotyping and cultural and critical mathematics instruction) were significantly different in racially diverse magnet schools than in the neighborhood schools. Overall, our data reveal the existence of a highly motivated Resistor profile among Black students, that is predicted by cultural and critical mathematics instruction but underrepresented within this district’s selective magnet schools. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2024."

Energy efficiency, as a determinant of carbon neutrality, was selected as an indicator for analysis because it records particularly unfavorable indicators in the region under observation. The research was carried out on a sample of seven Balkan countries and their surrounding areas. An initial qualitative analysis was followed by a quantitative analysis based on a combination of statistical methods and soft computing. Six indicators were selected for the analysis covering a period of 30 years (1990–2020). Results: A significant obstacle to the green transition and the region’s transition to a circular economy and carbon neutrality is energy efficiency and energy related pollution—the reliance of most countries on coal-fired thermal power plants for electricity generation. The research results showed the following: (a) the degree of economic development and membership in the European Union are not significantly related to the level of energy efficiency; (b) most of the sampled countries are in the initial stages of introducing activities to achieve carbon neutrality; and (c) only Slovenia has documented consistent indicators and evident advancements in its efforts to achieve carbon neutrality. Based on the research findings, proposals for improvements were made in the direction of policymaking and in a methodological sense. Conclusions: The implementation of circularity and carbon neutrality as a long-term goal of the European Union is not necessarily related to the level of economic development, nor can its trajectory be exclusively ascertained by means of data processing and monitoring. A more precise understanding of a carbon-neutral future can be achieved through the incorporation of qualitative data to a greater extent, a realistic evaluation of historical facts and their repercussions, as well as projections of the effects that reality and global developments after 2022 will have on each country. © The Author(s) 2024."

As overwhelming experimental measurements of KM are difficult and time-consuming, prediction of the KM values from machine and deep learning models would increase the pace of the enzymes kinetics studies. Existing machine and deep learning models are limited to the specific enzymes, i.e., a minority of enzymes or wildtype enzymes. Here, we used a deep learning framework PaddlePaddle to implement a machine and deep learning approach (GraphKM) for KM prediction of wildtype and mutant enzymes. GraphKM is composed by graph neural networks (GNN), fully connected layers and gradient boosting framework. We represented the substrates through molecular graph and the enzymes through a pretrained transformer-based language model to construct the model inputs. We compared the difference of the model results made by the different GNN (GIN, GAT, GCN, and GAT-GCN). The GAT-GCN-based model generally outperformed. To evaluate the prediction performance of the GraphKM and other reported KM prediction models, we collected an independent KM dataset (HXKm) from literatures. © The Author(s) 2024."

We make a case for an “integrated inter- and transdisciplinarity” that overcomes the typical additive nature of current interdisciplinary work and better captures the inherent complexity of public health and other public policy problems. We propose systems science and systems thinking approaches as a useful meta-theoretical, self-reflecting approach for such integration to take place. Enabled by systems thinking, the praxis of “integrated inter- and transdisciplinarity” allows for an understanding of public health crises in a human-centred socio-ecological perspective. This grounds more holistic policy responses, which by mobilising the whole of government and whole of society, put individuals, groups, governments and society at large in critical dialogue to co-produce and co-design interventions that address crises in all their physical, social, psychological, economic and political dimensions. © The Author(s) 2024."

Although these stencils provide direct impressions of the artists’ hands, the characterization of their biological profile (i.e., biological sex and age) is very challenging. Previous studies have attempted this analysis with traditional morphometrics (TM), whereas little research has been undertaken using Geometric Morphometrics (GM), a method widely used in other disciplines but only tentatively employed in rock art studies. However, the large variation in relative finger position in archaeological hands poses the question of whether these representations can be examined through GM, or, in contrast, if this creates an unmanageable error in the results. To address this issue, a 2D hand scans sample of 70 living individuals (F = 35; M = 35) has been collected in three standardized positions (n = 210) and digitized with 32 2D conventional landmarks. Results show that the intra-individual distance (mean Procrustes distance between Pos. 1–2 = 0.132; 2–3 = 0.191; 1–3 = 0.292) is larger than the inter-individual distance (mean in 1 = 0.122; 2 = 0.142; 3 = 0.165). Finally, it has been demonstrated that the relative finger positions, as well as the inclusion of all hand parts in the analysis, have an overshadowing effect on other variables potentially involved in the morphometric variability of the hand, such as biological sex. © The Author(s) 2024."

Individual differences across spatial tasks have been strongly linked to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) interest and success. Several variables have been proposed to explain individual differences in spatial ability, including affective factors such as one’s confidence and anxiety. However, research is lacking on whether affective variables such as confidence and anxiety relate to individual differences in both a mental rotation task (MRT) and a perspective-taking and spatial orientation task (PTSOT). Using a sample of 100 college students completing introductory STEM courses, the present study investigated the effects of self-reported spatial confidence, spatial anxiety, and general anxiety on MRT and PTSOT. Spatial confidence, after controlling for effects of general anxiety and biological sex, was significantly related to performance on both the MRT and PTSOT. Spatial anxiety, after controlling for effects of general anxiety and biological sex, was not related to either PTSOT or MRT scores. Together these findings suggest some affective factors, but not others, contribute to spatial ability performance to a degree that merits advanced investigation in future studies. © The Author(s) 2024."

Here, we ground these ideas in formal terms by systematically studying mobility patterns in the scientific knowledge landscape. We use low-dimensional embedding techniques to create a knowledge space made up of 1.5 million articles from the fields of physics, computer science, and mathematics. By analyzing the publication histories of individual researchers, we discover patterns of scientific mobility that closely resemble physical mobility. In aggregate, the trajectories form mobility flows that can be described by a gravity model, with jumps more likely to occur in areas of high density and less likely to occur over longer distances. We identify two types of researchers from their individual mobility patterns: interdisciplinary explorers who pioneer new fields, and exploiters who are more likely to stay within their specific areas of expertise. Our results suggest that spatial mobility analysis is a valuable tool for understanding the evolution of science. © The Author(s) 2024."

Caenorhabditis elegans is commonly used in embryonic research due to its consistent cell lineage from fertilized egg to adulthood. Biologists use 4D confocal imaging to observe gene expression dynamics at the single-cell level. However, on one hand, the observed tree-shaped time-series datasets have characteristics such as non-pairwise data points between different individuals. On the other hand, the influence of cell type heterogeneity should also be considered during clustering, aiming to obtain more biologically significant clustering results. Results: A biclustering model is proposed for tree-shaped single-cell gene expression data of Caenorhabditis elegans. Detailedly, a tree-shaped piecewise polynomial function is first employed to fit non-pairwise gene expression time series data. Then, four factors are considered in the objective function, including Pearson correlation coefficients capturing gene correlations, p-values from the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test measuring the similarity between cells, as well as gene expression size and bicluster overlapping size. After that, Genetic Algorithm is utilized to optimize the function. Conclusion: The results on the small-scale dataset analysis validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our model and are superior to existing classical biclustering models. Besides, gene enrichment analysis is employed to assess the results on the complete real dataset analysis, confirming that the discovered biclustering results hold significant biological relevance. © The Author(s) 2024."

The current study focused on two ontogenetically early emerging cognitive skills that may be important predictors of later math skills (i.e., geometry and numeracy): children's understanding of abstract relations between objects and quantities as evidenced by their patterning skills and the approximate number system (ANS). Children's patterning skills, the ANS, numeracy, geometry, nonverbal intelligence (IQ), and executive functioning (EF) skills were assessed at age 4 years, and their numeracy and geometry knowledge was assessed again a year later at age 5 (N = 113). Above and beyond children's initial knowledge in numeracy and geometry, as well as IQ and EF, patterning skills and the ANS at age 4 uniquely predicted children's geometry knowledge at age 5, but only age 4 patterning uniquely predicted age 5 numeracy. Thus, although patterning and the ANS are related, they differentially explain variation in later geometry and numeracy knowledge. Results are discussed in terms of implications for early mathematics theory and research. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Compared with the classical version of this method, the modified version can execute its procedures pure symbolically without the need to assign any system parameters even for some complicated nonlinear oscillators. This means that the relations between amplitude of limit cycles and system parameters can be derived analytically from the proposed method. Meanwhile, the analytical expression of characteristic quantity of limit cycles can be also obtained. Via these analytical expressions, the evolutional process of limit cycles can be studied quantitatively in amplitude domain. It demonstrates the entire live period of each limit cycle from its generation to bifurcation to destination. To show the feasibility of the proposed method, a complicated oscillator named generalized Duffing–Harmonic–Rayleigh–Liénard oscillator is investigated in this paper. First, the two analytical expressions mentioned above are derived and the global evolution of its limit cycles are analyzed quantitatively. Second, the critical value of homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcation parameters are also predicted via this two analytical expressions. Moreover, the analytical approximate solutions of both limit cycles and homo-heteroclinic orbits are calculated. To prove the accuracy, all the above results obtained via the proposed methods are confirmed by the Runge–Kutta method, which show a good accordance. Therefore, the proposed method can be considered as an effective modification for a classical perturbation method. It provides another feasible and reliable analytical quantitative method for analyzing global dynamics of strongly nonlinear oscillators. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The uniformity of flow distribution showed a trend of firstly increasing and then remaining unchanged with the increase of Re (4 ∼ 680).

However, other research indicates that positive perceptions of experts in these fields might not necessarily lead to students’ pursuit of STEM careers. Self-concept, defined as one’s perceived abilities in specific academic domains, likely plays a moderating role in the relationship between perceptions and career aspirations according to the motivational theory of role modelling. Moreover, students’ perceptions of STEM professionals might be sourced from STEM-related media and school experiences. Therefore, through running a moderated mediation model, this study examined whether and how the influences of media consumption and school STEM learning opportunities on career aspirations would be mediated by perceptions of STEM professionals, and whether the mediation effect would be conditional on students’ self-concept. Methods: Data were collected through an online survey of 608 primary and secondary school students from Hong Kong, and were analysed using structural equation modelling. Results: Results revealed that the students’ positive perceptions of STEM professionals were positively associated with their career aspirations, and mediated the links from media consumption and school opportunities to career aspirations. In addition, this mediated pathway depended on STEM self-concept, such that perceptions of STEM professionals were only linked with STEM career aspirations for adolescents with average or high levels of self-concept. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest the need to pay attention to the STEM perceptions and self-concept interaction while designing and implementing learning activities to connect a diversity of students with STEM careers. It is not only important to foster students’ self-concept, but also to enrich their knowledge of diverse occupations, so as to help diversify their perceptions that being professionals in these fields is desirable and attainable, and to eventually inspire more student engagement and participation in STEM. © 2024, The Author(s)."

Attackers typically obfuscate strings of PHP-based malicious webshells and encrypt communication traffic to bypass security devices. In this case, the opcode sequences of the PHP-based malicious webshells become excessively long and contain many irrelevant features, which affect the efficacy of the detection method. This study proposes a new PHP-based malicious webshell detection method. The proposed method introduces three simplification strategies for the three main types of nodes in the abstract syntax trees of PHP scripts to reduce the length and noise of opcode sequences of PHP-based malicious webshells. An explicit duration recurrent network (EDRN), a recurrent neural network based on an extended hidden semi-Markov model, is used to detect malicious webshells. Word2vec is adopted to convert the opcode sequences of the PHP scripts into vectors that serve as the input for the EDRN. Experiments were conducted using public datasets collected from GitHub. The experimental results indicated that EDRN outperformed popular recurrent neural networks. The proposed method demonstrated superior performance compared with several state-of-the-art approaches and mainstream tools, achieving an accuracy of 0.993, an F1 score of 0.990, and a recall rate of 0.991. When only 20% of the datasets were used for training, the proposed method achieved accuracy, recall, and F1 scores of 0.985, 0.983, and 0.980, respectively, significantly outperforming existing approaches. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Accordingly, risk analysis is indispensable for the risk prevention and control of LIBs. Nevertheless, it is difficult to establish a physics-informed risk analysis model due to the complex material characteristics and aging mechanisms of LIBs. Meanwhile, the data-driven approach requires historical information of LIBs and does not merely rely on knowledge of the internal mechanisms of LIBs. This study proposes a method integrating the physics-informed Bayesian network (BN) (i.e., mapping from fault tree) and data-driven BN (i.e., learning from data) to conduct risk analysis of LIBs. First, we establish physics-informed and data-driven BNs. Subsequently, we bridge physics-informed and data-driven BNs to establish a Bayesian network for risk analysis of LIB accidents. Second, we set up safety barriers in the system, including detectors, emergency response, and firefighting facilities. Third, we evaluate the performance of safety barriers. We validate the proposed model using data from LIBs in air transportation. The results indicate that safety barriers can reduce the accidental risk of LIBs. Eventually, we propose suggestions for the risk control of LIBs in air transportation. This study is supposed to provide theoretical basis for the risk prevention and control of LIB accidents. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

We consider bidirectional couplings of two designs: (i) diffusion type with feedback and (ii) bidirectional type without feedback. Assuming that the number of lasers is sufficiently large, we propose integro-differential models for spatially distributed variables with periodic boundary conditions. The critical value of the coupling coefficient is determined at which the stationary state of laser generation spontaneously becomes unstable due to the presence of a delay in the coupling lines. Bifurcations of asymptotically infinite dimension are described. For both types of coupling, we obtain the same two-dimensional complex partial differential equation of the Ginzburg–Landau type (with the difference only in the coefficients) for the slowly varying amplitude of the fundamental harmonic. Using the simplest homogeneous solution of such a quasi-normal form, the oscillations of laser radiation in chains, which can be anti-phase or in-phase depending on the time delay and the design of the couplings, are analytically described. © 2024"

Experiments were conducted on two- and three-coupled beams under electrostatic actuation to verify the capability of the model to predict the mechanical response of coupled beam arrays. The fabricated device, comprising polysilicon-coupled microbeams, is produced using the Multi-User MEMS Processes, followed by an experimental investigation. Numerical results were found in good agreement with their experimental counterparts. The developed model was used to demonstrate the possible adjustment of the electrostatic actuation to enhance the sensitivity of the dynamic response of the coupled MEMS resonator to mass perturbations. By leveraging the mode localization phenomenon and incorporating a novel differential capacitance sensing mechanism, a notable 84% improvement in sensitivity when switching from two-beam to three-beam system while operating near the second mode in the linear regime. Actuating the MEMS device at higher voltages enabled to achieve higher sensitivity thanks to the activation of nonlinear effects such as bifurcation and softening. We observed the transition from nonlinear to nearly-linear dynamic response of the coupled beams upon the addition of mass and demonstrated how bifurcations that cause a sudden shift to a high-amplitude motion can be utilized in differential capacitance-based mass sensing. Additionally, the suggested detection mechanism allows for overcoming the inherent parasitic capacitance, thereby mitigating low signal-to-noise ratios. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Viewing crack nucleation as a structural stability problem, we analyze how solutions with diffuse damage become unstable and bifurcate towards localized states, representing the smeared version of cracks. We consider gradient damage models with a linear softening response, incorporating distinct softening parameters for the spherical and deviatoric modes. These parameters are employed to adjust the peak pressure and shear stress, resulting in an equivalent cohesive behavior. Through analytical and numerical second-order stability and bifurcation analyses, we characterize the crack nucleation conditions in quasi-static, rate-independent evolutions governed by a local energy minimization principle. We assess the stability of crack development, determining whether it is preceded by a stable phase with diffuse damage or not. Our results quantitatively characterize the classical transition between brittle and cohesive-like behaviors. A fully analytical solution for a one-dimensional problem provides a clear illustration of the complex bifurcation and instability phenomena, underpinning their connection with classical energetic arguments. The stability analysis under multi-axial loading reveals a fundamental non-trivial influence of the loading mode on the critical load for crack nucleation. We show that volumetric-dominated deformation mode can remain stable in the softening regime, thus delaying crack nucleation after the peak stress. This feature depends only on the properties of the local response of the material and is insensitive to structural scale effects. Our findings disclose the subtle interplay among the regularization length, the material's cohesive length-scale, structural size, and the loading mode to determine the crack nucleation conditions and the effective strength of phase-field models of fracture. © 2024 The Authors"

The model is obtained by applying a coupled map lattice (CML) method. First, using linear stability analysis, the existence and stability conditions for fixed points are determined. Second, using the center manifold theorem and the bifurcation theory, the occurrence of flip, Neimark-Sacker, and Turing bifurcations are discussed. It is shown that the patterns obtained are results of Turing, flip, and Neimark-Sacker instabilities. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the theoretical analysis and to reveal complex and rich dynamics of the model, such as times series, maximal Lyapunov exponent, bifurcation diagrams, and phase portraits. Interesting patterns like spiral pattern, polygonal pattern, and the combinations of patterns of spiral waves and stripes are formed. The CML model's results help to understand how a spatially extended, discrete intraguild predation model forms complex patterns. Notably, the continuous reaction–diffusion counterpart of the model under study is incapable of experiencing Turing instability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The suffix tree of a text string T of length n has O(n) nodes and edges, and the string label of each edge is encoded by a pair of positions in T. Thus, even after the tree is built, the input string T needs to be kept stored and random access to T is still needed. The linear-size suffix tries (LSTs), proposed by Crochemore et al. [Linear-size suffix tries, TCS 638:171-178, 2016], are a “stand-alone” alternative to the suffix trees. Namely, the LST of an input text string T of length n occupies O(n) total space, and supports pattern matching and other tasks with the same efficiency as the suffix tree without the need to store the input text string T. Crochemore et al. proposed an offline algorithm which transforms the suffix tree of T into the LST of T in O(nlog⁡σ) time and O(n) space, where σ is the alphabet size. In this paper, we present two types of online algorithms which “directly” construct the LST, from right to left, and from left to right, without constructing the suffix tree as an intermediate structure. Both algorithms construct the LST incrementally when a new symbol is read, and do not access the previously read symbols. Both of the right-to-left construction algorithm and the left-to-right construction algorithm work in O(nlog⁡σ) time and O(n) space. The main feature of our algorithms is that the input text string does not need to be stored. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Plasma consists of cold dust grains, along with isothermal electrons and positive ions for balance. Fluid equations simplify through reductive perturbation, yielding the modified Korteweg–de Vries equation for analyzing weak dust-acoustic solitons. Applying this method to a specific scenario involving negatively charged dust grains and protons with all electrons bound to the dust grains shows support for rarefactive supersonic solitons, contrasting with typical compressive ion-acoustic solitons. Introducing streaming reveals a subtle soliton amplitude decrease. Using the Generalized exp(-S(φ)) expansion method effectively derives various soliton solutions, including kink, anti-kink, singular, hyperbolic functions, and diverse solitary waves. Furthermore, the equation's dynamic behaviors are explored through equilibrium point bifurcations. Employing a Galilean transformation, the model is transformed into a planar dynamical system, and qualitative inspection is performed. Phase portraits depict bifurcation outcomes.

Understanding the preferences of medical and journalism students for the way in which health risks are communicated and their understanding of words used to describe risk is an important first step to inform interdisciplinary learning. Methods: Medical and journalism students (n = 203) completed an online survey where they were given qualitative descriptors of risk such as ‘a chance’, ‘probably’ and ‘unlikely’, and asked to assign a number that represents what the word means to them. Different formats of communicating risk (percentages, natural frequency and visual aids) were provided and students were asked to select and explain their preference. A thematic analysis of reasons was conducted. Numeracy and perceived mathematics ability were measured. Results: Numbers assigned to the descriptor ‘A chance’ had the highest variability for medical students. Numbers assigned to the descriptor ‘Probably’ had the highest variability for journalism students. Using visual aids was the most popular format for risk communication for both courses (56% of medical students and 40% of journalism students). Using percentages was twice as popular with journalism students compared to medical students (36% vs. 18%). Perceived mathematics ability was lower in students with a preference for natural frequencies and in journalism students, however performance on an objective numeracy scale was similar for all three formats (percentages, natural frequency and visual aids). Reasons for choosing a preferred format included good communication, eliciting a response, or learning style. Conclusions: Education on health risk communication for medical and journalism students should emphasize the need for qualitative descriptors of risk to be combined with the best available number. Students are already considering their role as future communicators of health risks and open to tailoring the mode of presentation to their audience. Further research is required on the design and evaluation of interdisciplinary workshops in health risk communication for medical and journalism students to maximise the opportunities for future inter-professional working. © 2024, The Author(s)."

The circuit consists of a resistor, an inductor and a nonlinear cubic voltage source. The shunt acts as an electrical analog to the mechanical nonlinear energy sinks (NESs). These mechanical NESs are passive vibration absorbers that typically have a cubic nonlinear stiffness. They have attractive properties such as saturation of the host system's vibration amplitude and strongly modulated response. This increases its operational frequency bandwidth and robustness against variations in the properties of host systems compared to linear vibration absorbers. However, the nonlinear nature may induce isolated responses in the host system that induce high vibration amplitudes. This paper investigates if these attractive properties also occur in the electric nonlinear energy sink shunt. An analytical expression for the frequency response is derived through the complexification-averaging method. Bifurcations in the frequency response reveal the occurrence of a quasi-periodic vibration energy exchange between the host system and the voltage over the electrodes of piezoelectric material. This is the main mechanism behind the amplitude saturation of the host system. Other bifurcations also reveal the existence of isolated responses. The nonlinear shunt is then realized with analog multipliers and a synthetic inductor and its performance in vibration damping is experimentally verified for a cantilever beam. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The moment of that displacement was the nineteenth century, and its broader significance is on particularly striking display in the British context, where the implications of algebraic abstraction were the object of sustained enquiry among mathematicians, logicians, and economists. This article argues that the ascendance of the algebraic equation, and the transformation in the conception of number on which it was premised, were not simply the product of evolutionary pressures internal to mathematics; the Victorian embrace of algebra was also a response to the practical and cognitive demands of Victorian economic life, which was increasingly reliant on attenuated exchange relations and merely nominal forms of ownership. This was an economy organized around the global extension of trade and characterized by the exponential growth of financial intermediation, of what Walter Bagehot called “number abstracted from reference.” Victorian economic practices thus modeled an abstraction that helped to justify the abstractions of mathematics, and that mathematics in turn was used by economic theorists to argue for the necessity and objectivity of their models. This mutually sustaining dialogue is particularly visible in the writings of William Stanley Jevons, who applied the principles of algebra to philosophy and economic theory so as to reconceive the logic of cognitive and social life in terms of equations. This logic, for which he was merely a spokesman, continues to shape our faith in the special value of abstract, theoretical knowledge. © 2023 Universidad de Antioquia."

Currently, visual sensing approaches typically involve a single static camera, resulting in a restricted and occluded field of view. In our work, we develop an active vision system using multiple cameras to dynamically capture multi-source RGB-D data. An integrated human sensing strategy based on a hierarchically connected tree structure is proposed to fuse localized visual information. Constituting the tree model are the nodes representing keypoints and the edges representing keyparts, which are consistently interconnected to preserve the structural constraints during multi-source fusion. Utilizing RGB-D data and HRNet, the 3D positions of keypoints are analytically estimated, and their presence is inferred through a sliding widow of confidence scores. Subsequently, the point clouds of reliable keyparts are extracted by drawing occlusion-resistant masks, enabling fine registration between data clouds and cylindrical model following the hierarchical order. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances keypart recognition recall from 69.20% to 90.10%, compared to employing a single static camera. Furthermore, in overcoming challenges related to localized and occluded perception, the robotic arm's obstacle avoidance capabilities are effectively improved. © 2024 The Authors"

To thoroughly investigate the impact of various human errors among seafarers on accidents, this paper aims to examine the relationships between seafarer competencies and maritime accidents using a data-driven approach from the perspective of bridge resource management (BRM). Through analysis of historical maritime accident reports, the dataset of seafarer competencies associated with maritime accidents is established. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method is employed to identify the critical seafarer competencies for accident prevention. Then, a data-driven Bayesian Network (BN) model, based on a Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) method, is constructed to reveal the relationship between seafarer competencies and accident types, which are validated by sensitivity analysis and case study. The results indicate that the key seafarer competencies for all maritime accidents are ‘Maneuvers’, ‘Amend/maintain ship course’, ‘Decision making’, ‘Cognitive capacity’, ‘Information’, ‘Procedure operations’, ‘Situational awareness’ and ‘Communication’. Moreover, the study underscores the importance of leveraging lessons learned from past accidents to mitigate risks and ensure safe maritime operations. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamics between seafarer competencies and accident types, unveiling the joint impact of different seafarer competencies on maritime accidents. This perspective offers valuable insights for maritime authorities in strengthening maritime safety regulations. © 2024 The Authors"

Generally, Sarawak is blessed with abundant green energy resources; however, constructive green energy integration methods were absent. Proper green energy integration is necessary due to its intermittent properties and geographical dispersion. Therefore, the paper proposes a novel methodology using Geographical Information System tools incorporating geographical databases, fuzzy logic operations and Traveling Salesman Problem-Binary Integer Programming algorithms to integrate green energies focusing on optimal power line routing design. The methodology begins with clustering the green energies based on geographical divisions. Then, it considers three influential factors (distance, elevation difference, and average ground flash density) and transforms them into matrix data for each cluster. Fuzzy logic operations optimize the trade-off among these factors and form fuzzy values. Following this, the Traveling Salesman Problem-Binary Integer Programming formulation creates pairs of green energy, distance vectors, equality constraints, and binary bounds. The optimization process constructs and eliminates multiple subtours to generate an optimal single loop with minimal value, representing the optimal power line routing design. Rigorous analyses, comparison, and validation demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms ordinary Traveling Salesman Problem-Binary Integer Programming, ranking top 1 across all clusters. Further evaluation against the state-of-the-art fuzzy Traveling Salesman Problem algorithms reveals that the proposed model secures the lowest fuzzy values with extremely low computation times across all clusters. Furthermore, the paper presents an innovative way to consider the ground flash density factor in green energy integration. The comprehensive algorithms and coding provided are valuable assets for researchers and investors to explore and conduct in-depth research on this prospect. Finally, this paper provides valuable directions for regional development, especially in harnessing and integrating green energies to boost economic and state infrastructure. © 2024"

Since crack propagation is characterized by a free boundary value problem (the geometry of the crack is not known beforehand, but part of the solution), approximations of the underlying sharp-interface problem based on phase-field models are often considered. Focusing on a rate-independent setting, these models are defined by a unidirectional gradient-flow of an energy functional. Since this energy functional is non-convex, the evolution of the variables such as the displacement field and the phase-field variable might be discontinuous in time leading to so-called brutal crack growth. For this reason, solution concepts have to be carefully chosen in order to predict discontinuities that are physically reasonable. One such concept is that of Balanced Viscosity solutions (BV solutions). This concept predicts physically sound energy trajectories that do not jump across energy barriers. The paper deals with a time-adaptive finite element phase-field model for rate-independent fracture which converges to BV solutions. The model is motivated by constraining the pseudo-velocity of the crack tip. The resulting constrained minimization problem is solved by the augmented Lagrangian method. Numerical examples highlight the predictive capabilities of the model and furthermore show the efficiency and the robustness of the final algorithm. © 2024 The Authors"

The cylinder's surface is uniformly heated and exhibits slipperiness, with the Navier slip condition incorporated into the model to account for wall slippage. Assuming the film thickness is significantly smaller than the cylinder radius, a nonlinear equation is derived to describe the thin film's evolution. The study focuses on the combined effects of rotation, exothermic chemical reactions, thermocapillary force, and wall slippage on system stability and dynamics. The present model uncovers that both slip and thermal effects amplify the Rayleigh–Plateau (RP) instability due to rotation. However, an exothermic reaction mitigates this instability. Through bifurcation analysis using weakly nonlinear stability, both supercritical and subcritical zones are found to be influenced by rotation and exothermic chemical reactions. Numerical simulations of the evolution equation are conducted to support these findings. © 2024"

Presently, Ethereum utilizes the LSM-tree-based storage engine that not only falls short of meeting Ethereum's read performance requirements but also presents additional mismatches. In this paper, we propose the single-level ordered log structure database (SolsDB), which fully utilizes state data features to satisfy the workload requirements of Ethereum block synchronization process and suggest novel interactions to deliver state data features to the storage engine. The write feature of state data is utilized to store state data in blocks and the file is globally ordered, which avoids write amplification caused by compaction. By delivering the read feature, the Parser module is crafted to parse the query key, enabling direct file location without the need for level-by-level querying, thus addressing the issue of read amplification.

This research proposes a Filippov incompatible insect technique (IIT) model with a threshold policy control for suppressing mosquito population. The model implements biological and chemical control strategies only when wild mosquito density surpasses an economic threshold. The biological strategy involves releasing Wolbachia-infected male mosquitoes, offering advantages such as a shortened lifespan and disease blocking. Simultaneously, moderate insecticide and larvicide spraying serve as a chemical approach to expedite the control process. The model provides economic advantages by minimizing control costs and environmental benefits through the integration of biological strategies, thus reducing reliance on chemicals. By employing Filippov's convex method, we identify necessary conditions for the existence of sliding segments and determine the dynamics of the switching line. Theoretical analysis reveals the model's long-term dynamics, including sliding bifurcations, pseudo-equilibria, and their stability. The model exhibits boundary equilibrium bifurcations and transcritical bifurcations in both free and controlled systems. Varying threshold values significantly impact the control outcomes effectiveness. The main findings demonstrate that integrated strategies efficiently decrease the population density of wild mosquitoes. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Furthermore, sensitivity analysis for the basic reproduction number R0 is performed and an optimal control problem is further formulated by incorporating TB prevention and education propaganda, timely treatment and enhancing therapy efficacy.

Despite the extensive experimental studies, the complex nonlinear mixing nature of PFCs continues to present significant challenges in solving and investigating their complete dynamics, which is difficult to achieve by existing computational approaches. In this paper, the entire solution space within a representative PFC induced by a 1:2 internal resonance is elucidated by conducting continuation computations and numerical long-time integrations. The proposed continuation approach is achieved by integrating our developed semi-analytical residue-regulating homotopy method (RRHM) with a pseudo arc-length continuation technique. In this solution space, we unearth wide-range nonlinear evolutions including overlapping intervals between the periodic and quasi-periodic branches, abundant multivalued sub-intervals, cyclic-fold (CF) bifurcations, and torus-doubling (TD) routes to chaos. In addition, multiple coexistences of a chaotic attractor and a periodic orbit, a chaotic attractor and a quasi-periodic orbit, as well as a periodic orbit and three quasi-periodic orbits are identified. Furthermore, we meticulously dissect and distinguish non-smooth variations in PFC morphology, which manifest as multiple jumps in comb spacing as the excitation frequency is swept across. This study could serve as a general guide for a comprehensive exploration of PFC dynamics and can offer insights to inform and inspire related experimental studies. © 2024"

The viscoelastic system is described by a second-order equation that governs the mechanical motion coupled to a first-order equation that governs the time evolution of the viscoelastic forces. The viscoelastic force evolves at a much slower rate than the elastic oscillations in the system. This adds additional time scales and degrees of freedom to the system compared to its viscous counterparts. The focus of this study is on the system's behavior under harmonic loading, which is expected to show both regular and chaotic dynamics for certain combinations of forcing frequency and amplitude. While the presence of chaos in this system has already been demonstrated, we shall concentrate only on the periodic solutions. The presence of the intrawell and interwell periodic oscillations is revealed using the Harmonic Balance method. The study also looks at the influence of parameter changes on the system's behavior through bifurcation diagrams, which enable us to identify optimal system parameters for maximum energy dissipation. Lastly, we formulate an equivalent viscous system using an energy-based approach. We observe that a naive viscous model fails to capture the behavior accurately depending on the system and excitation parameters, as well as the type of excitation. This underscores the necessity to study the full-scale viscoelastic system. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

This method progressively constructs a search tree by gathering samples throughout its execution. Predominantly applied within the realm of gaming, MCTS has exhibited exceptional achievements. Additionally, it has displayed promising outcomes when employed to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. MCTS has been adapted for distributed-memory parallel platforms. The primary challenges associated with distributed-memory parallel MCTS are the substantial communication overhead and the necessity to balance the computational load among various processes. In this work, we introduce a novel distributed-memory parallel MCTS algorithm with partial backpropagations, referred to as Parallel Partial-Backpropagation MCTS (PPB-MCTS). Our design approach aims to significantly reduce the communication overhead while maintaining, or even slightly improving, the performance in the context of combinatorial optimization problems. To address the communication overhead challenge, we propose a strategy involving transmitting an additional backpropagation message. This strategy avoids attaching an information table to the communication messages exchanged by the processes, thus reducing the communication overhead. Furthermore, this approach contributes to enhancing the decision-making accuracy during the selection phase. The load balancing issue is also effectively addressed by implementing a shared transposition table among the parallel processes. Furthermore, we introduce two primary methods for managing duplicate states within distributed-memory parallel MCTS, drawing upon techniques utilized in addressing duplicate states within sequential MCTS. Duplicate states can transform the conventional search tree into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). To evaluate the performance of our proposed parallel algorithm, we conduct an extensive series of experiments on solving instances of the Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) and the Weighted Set-Cover Problem (WSCP). These problems are recognized for their complexity and classified as NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems with considerable relevance within industrial applications. The experiments are performed on a cluster of computers with many cores. The empirical results highlight the enhanced scalability of our algorithm compared to that of the existing distributed-memory parallel MCTS algorithms. As the number of processes increases, our algorithm demonstrates increased rollout efficiency while maintaining an improved load balance across processes. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Children's math anxiety is negatively related to their math achievement, suggesting that math anxiety puts their math learning at risk. Several theoretical accounts have been proposed that help to explain this association between math anxiety and achievement. In the current study, we aimed to test predictions of two prominent theories, namely the disruption account and the reduced competency account, using a comprehensive and unifying approach. A sample of 6- to 8-year-olds (N = 163) answered a math anxiety questionnaire, solved a spatial task (mental rotation), and solved several arithmetic problems. After each arithmetic problem, they were asked how they solved the problem. Strategies were then classified into counting and higher-level mental strategies (including decomposition and retrieval), with higher-level strategies loading strongly on working memory resources. Analyses revealed a negative, albeit small, association between children's math anxiety and accuracy in solving arithmetic problems. In line with the disruption account, children's frequency of using higher-level mental strategies mediated this relation between math anxiety and arithmetic performance. Moreover, our results support the reduced competency account given that arithmetic performance was related to math anxiety, whereas mental rotation was only indirectly related to math anxiety. Overall, our findings corroborate both accounts, lending further support to the notion that these accounts might not be mutually exclusive. Our findings imply that interventions might be most effective when focusing on emotion regulation strategies and improving mathematical and spatial performance. © 2024 The Author(s)"

We adopt the (arguably) weakest possible model of such a device: a deterministic memoryless automaton (DMA), i.e., a deterministic automaton with a single state. As expected, such a weak machine is incapable of exploring many graphs without marking nodes. Hence we allow the agent to use identical movable pebbles that can be dropped on nodes or picked from them. It turns out that this marking capability significantly enhances the exploration power of the agent. Our goal is to study how the availability of pebbles impacts the class of graphs that a DMA can explore. We first concentrate on finite graphs and show that any finite tree can be explored by a DMA without pebbles but there exist (small) finite graphs that cannot be explored by a DMA without pebbles. Then we turn attention to infinite graphs and fully characterize the class of infinite trees that can be explored by a DMA without pebbles. We also define a large class of infinite trees that can be explored by a DMA with finitely many pebbles. It turns out that many of these trees cannot be explored by a DMA without pebbles. On the other hand, we show a large class of infinite trees that cannot be explored by a DMA with finitely many pebbles. Thus, availability of pebbles yields a strict hierarchy of difficulty of exploration of infinite graphs by a DMA, and this hierarchy is strict even for the class of infinite trees: some trees can be explored without pebbles, some trees can be explored with finitely many pebbles but not without pebbles, and some trees require infinitely many pebbles. Finally, we consider exploration by a DMA with infinitely many pebbles. It turns out that all infinite trees can be explored by a DMA with infinitely many pebbles. By contrast, we construct infinite graphs that cannot be explored by any DMA, even with infinitely many pebbles. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Amid the surging interest in renewable energy, offshore wind-farms have emerged as a promising solution. To ensure their efficient and effective operation, it becomes imperative to systematically identify and mitigate potential risks. This study addresses the critical need to systematically prioritize risk reduction strategies for offshore wind farms, a problem that has not been comprehensively explored in the literature. A multi-criteria analysis has been adopted to simultaneously evaluate the contradictory criteria in the evaluation process. The novelty of this study lies in its integration of spherical fuzzy sets with multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques to handle uncertainties and evaluate contradictory criteria simultaneously. As a result of all this analysis, the most critical risks for offshore wind-farms and risk mitigation strategies that can be adopted within the determined risks have been revealed. The main findings reveal that turbine underperformance, disruption of habitats, and grid connection issues are the most critical risks.

The proposed work focuses on curtailing peak power demand of residential consumers through shifting the appliances connection time. The load scheduling is modeled as an optimization problem and solved using whale optimization algorithm and fuzzy logic. This is followed by reviewing the required size of the rooftop solar photovoltaic system for various types of residential consumers in a community using self-consumption and self-sufficiency-based indices. The proposed optimization algorithm effectively reduces the peak power drawn by 27 % and the peak-to-average ratio by 30.69 % on average in the residential community. Further, the rooftop PV size assessed substantiates that the energy drawn from the grid is nearly zero, attaining energy independence. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

We have developed an integrated demand response method for multiple rooms, consisting of an optimization layer and a control layer, to maintain thermal comfort and save energy and costs. For the optimization layer, we apply fuzzy logic to adjust indoor temperature setpoints to respond to dynamic heat prices and propose an optimal heat supply method to find optimal heat supply schemes. For the control layer, a multi-objective model predictive control (MPC) has been developed to manage indoor thermal conditions across multiple rooms. To test and verify the integrated demand response method, we build a multi-room simulation model using the CARNOT Toolbox. The results show that adopting different indoor temperature setpoints during working and nonworking hours, combined with the MPC method, has an energy-saving potential of 9.1 % compared to maintaining a constant indoor temperature using DH alone. Adjusting temperature setpoints using fuzzy logic utilizes the building's heat storage capacity to increase energy flexibility, reaching 16.0 % savings in energy and reducing 12.6 % heating costs. © 2024 The Authors"

Here, we present S3DFT, a library that circumvents this by using point-to-point communication – albeit at a higher arithmetic complexity. This approach exploits three variants of Cannon's algorithm with adaptations for block tensor-matrix multiplications. We demonstrate S3DFT's efficient use of hardware resources, and its scaling using up to 16,464 cores of the JUWELS Cluster. However, in a comparison with well-established 3D FFT libraries, its parallel efficiency and performance were found to fall behind. A detailed analysis identifies the cause in two of its component algorithms, which scale poorly owing to how their communication patterns are mapped in subsets of the fat tree topology. This result exposes a potential drawback of running block-wise parallel algorithms on systems with fat tree networks caused by increased communication latencies along specific directions of the mesh of processing elements. © 2024 The Author(s)"

One promising evidence-based technique that is thought to increase long-term memory is spaced retrieval practice, or repeated testing over time. The beneficial effect of spacing has repeatedly been demonstrated in the laboratory as well as in undergraduate mathematics courses, but its generalizability across diverse STEM courses is unknown. We investigated the effect of spaced retrieval practice in nine introductory STEM courses. Retrieval practice opportunities were embedded in bi-weekly quizzes, either massed on a single quiz or spaced over multiple quizzes. Student performance on practice opportunities and a criterial test at the end of each course were examined as a function of massed or spaced practice. We also conducted a single-paper meta-analysis on criterial test scores to assess the generalizability of the effectiveness of spaced retrieval practice across introductory STEM courses. Results: Significant positive effects of spacing on the criterial test were found in only two courses (Calculus I for Engineers and Chemistry for Health Professionals), although small positive effect sizes were observed in two other courses (General Chemistry and Diversity of Life). Meta-analyses revealed a significant spacing effect when all courses were included, but not when calculus was excluded. The generalizability of the spacing effect across STEM courses therefore remains unclear. Conclusions: Although we could not clearly determine the generalizability of the benefits of spacing in STEM courses, our findings indicate that spaced retrieval practice could be a low-cost method of improving student performance in at least some STEM courses. More work is needed to determine when, how, and for whom spaced retrieval practice is most beneficial. The effect of spacing in classroom settings may depend on some design features such as the nature of retrieval practice activities (multiple-choice versus short answer) and/or feedback settings, as well as student actions (e.g., whether they look at feedback or study outside of practice opportunities). The evidence is promising, and further pragmatic research is encouraged. © The Author(s) 2024."

For the case when the weight function is conservative, i.e., when every cycle has non-negative total weight, the complexity of the SHORTEST ODD PATH problem had been open for 20 years, and was recently shown to be NP-hard. We give a polynomial-time algorithm for the special case when the weight function is conservative and the set E− of negative-weight edges forms a single tree. Our algorithm exploits the strong connection between SHORTEST ODD PATH and the problem of finding two internally vertex-disjoint paths between two terminals in an undirected edge-weighted graph. It also relies on solving an intermediary problem variant called SHORTEST PARITY-CONSTRAINED ODD PATH where for certain edges we have parity constraints on their position along the path. Also, we exhibit two FPT algorithms for solving SHORTEST ODD PATH. The first FPT algorithm is parameterized by |E−|, the number of negative edges, or more generally, by the maximum size of a matching in the subgraph of G spanned by E−, when the weight function is conservative. Our second FPT algorithm is parameterized by the treewidth of G, and the algorithm does not rely on conservativeness. © 2024 The Authors"

This underlines the need for better understanding of the transmission dynamics and proposing an optimal intervention strategy to control the disease. In this article, a deterministic mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of gonorrhoea as an antibiotic resistant disease in a population with an imperfect vaccination is proposed and analysed. The model incorporates the classes of vaccinated individuals and individuals equipped with self protection interventions to reduce antibiotic resistant cases. The threshold parameter R0, the basic reproduction number, for the analysis of the model is calculated. In the given setting, the model exhibits a backward bifurcation for R0<1. However, if the efficacy of the vaccine is 100% without a waning effect, the model is shown to be without a backward bifurcation and the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable whenever R0<1. The global sensitivity analysis of the model to variations in parameter values is also performed to determine the most influential parameters on the disease transmission. Moreover, the optimal control analysis of the full model is presented and the optimal intervention strategies are proposed. The proposed intervention strategies are shown to be able to control the disease within a relatively shorter period of time. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical analysis of the model. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

This intuitive assumption has been challenged recently (Fussmann & Blasius, 2005). Having considered the prey–predator system as a paradigm of nonlinear population dynamics, it has been shown that in fact both the bifurcation structure and the structure of the phase space can be rather different even when the component functions are apparently close to each other. However, these observations have so far been largely limited to nonspatial systems described by ODEs. In this paper, our main interest is to investigate whether such structural sensitivity occurs in spatially explicit models of population dynamics, in particular those that are described by PDEs. We consider a prey–predator model described by a system of two nonlinear reaction–diffusion–advection equations where the predation term is parameterized by three different yet numerically close functions. Using some analytical tools along with numerical simulations, we show that the properties of spatiotemporal dynamics are rather different between the three cases, so that patterns observed for one parameterization may not occur for the other two ones. © 2024 The Authors"

Roof falls may cause life-threatening and non-fatal injuries to miners and impede mining and transportation operations. As a result, a reliable roof fall prediction model is essential to tackle such challenges. Different parameters that substantially impact roof falls are ill-defined and intangible, making this an uncertain and challenging research issue. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health assembled a national database of roof performance from 37 coal mines to explore the factors contributing to roof falls. Data acquired for 37 mines is limited due to several restrictions, which increased the likelihood of incompleteness. Fuzzy logic is a technique for coping with ambiguity, incompleteness, and uncertainty. Therefore, In this paper, the fuzzy inference method is presented, which employs a genetic algorithm to create fuzzy rules based on 109 records of roof fall data and pattern search to refine the membership functions of parameters. The performance of the deployed model is evaluated using statistical measures such as the Root-Mean-Square Error , Mean-Absolute-Error, and coefficient of determination (R2). Based on these criteria, the suggested model outperforms the existing models to precisely predict roof fall rates using fewer fuzzy rules. © 2023, The Author(s)."

However, differences in parents’ beliefs can influence their behavior during parent–child interactions. We examined how parental beliefs about the fixedness of children's math and reading abilities shape their interactions with their 4- and 5-year-old children during an educational activity. Parental beliefs about children's abilities were manipulated using “articles” indicating that academic ability is fixed in one domain (e.g., math) but malleable in another (e.g., reading). We then investigated differences in parental unconstructive (performance-oriented and controlling) and constructive (mastery-oriented and autonomy-supportive) involvement across conditions. We also examined whether parent behavior differed depending on the type of educational material parents were told the activity tapped into. The results showed that parents who were induced to have a fixed mindset about reading took full control of the reading activity more often than those who were induced to have a growth mindset about reading, but not math. Parents did not differ in constructive involvement between mindset induction conditions in either domain. We also found that parent autonomy behavior in math differed depending on parents’ general theory of intelligence beliefs. Overall, we found some evidence that parents’ beliefs about the malleability of their children's ability in a specific domain affected their behaviors in that domain. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Methods: A qualitative-quantitative method was used. Firstly, interdisciplinary subjects demanded by medical graduates and senior medical students were defined by qualitative study. In the second stage, questionnaire was developed which based on the findings of qualitative stage, experts’ opinion and reviewing of the national general guide of professional ethics for medical practitioners. Questionnaire consisted of demographic, occupational and thirteen interdisciplinary items. These items consisted of social determinants of health, social and economic consequences of disease, social prescribing, physicians’ social responsibility, role of gender, racial, ethnic, social and economic issues in approach to patients, role of logic and mathematics in clinical decision-making, philosophy of medicine, maintaining work-life balance, self-anger management, national laws of medicine, religious law in medical practice, health system structure, and teamwork principles. Level and importance of knowledge and self-assessed educational needs were asked about each item. In the third stage, a national online survey was conducted. SPSS 25 was used for statistics. Results: By content analysis of data in qualitative stage, 36 sub-themes and 7 themes were extracted. In the quantitative part, 3580 subjects from 41 medical universities across Iran participated in this study. 2896 (80.9%) were medical graduates and 684 (19.1%) were senior medical students. Overall, knowledge about interdisciplinary items was low to intermediate, while high to very high knowledge ranged from maximally 38.7% about socioeconomic consequences of disease to minimally 17.2% about social prescribing. Participants gave the most importance to the having knowledge about self-anger management (88.3%), maintaining work-life balance (87.2%) and social determinants of health (85.8%), respectively. However, national laws of medicine (77.6%), maintaining work-life balance (75.4%) and self-anger management (74%) were the first top three educational demands by participants. Conclusion: This study revealed a low to moderate level of knowledge about interdisciplinary topics among both graduated medical physicians and senior medical students.

This framework is commonly employed to explain the behavior of optical solitons in nonlinear media. The applications of MSSEM allows us to acquire the precise analytical solutions, which incorporate a diverse array of optical soliton solutions. We discuss the dynamical structure of the solitons, bifurcation and chaos theory to develop the multiple soliton solutions, including rational, hyperbolic, exponential, and trigonometric functions and depending on the principle of balancing equation. Moreover, by using bifurcation and chaos theory, we examine the governing model with and without the perturbation term and provide the three-dimensional, two-dimensional, and density profiles to improve the clarity of obtained results. The different aspects of the solutions are evident in our visual representations. These solutions are applicable to a wide range of domains, including fluid physics, oceanography, physics, engineering, and nonlinear optics. © 2024 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University"

While methods and optimizations exist for efficient inequality join in batch processing, little attention has been given to its streaming version, particularly to large-scale data-intensive applications that run on Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPSs). Designing an inequality join in streaming and distributed settings is not an easy task: (i) indexes have to be employed to efficiently support inequality-based comparisons, but the continuous stream of data imposes continuous insertions, updates, and deletions of elements in the indexes—hence a huge overhead for the DSPSs; (ii) oftentimes real data is skewed, which makes indexing even more challenging. To address these challenges, we propose the Stream-Aware inequality join (STA), an indexing method that can reduce redundancy and index update overhead. STA builds a separate in-memory index structure for hotkeys, i.e., the most frequently used keys, which are automatically identified with an efficient data sketch. On the other hand, the cold keys are treated using a linked set of index structures. In this way, STA avoids many superfluous index updates for frequent items. Finally, we implement four state-of-the-art inequality join solutions for a widely employed DSPS (Apache Storm) and compare their performance with STA on four real-world data sets and a synthetic one. The results of our experimental evaluation reveal that our stream-aware approach outperforms existing solutions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Although data-driven technology has facilitated the planning process successfully, the implementation mechanism of UUS planning remains obscure, potentially undermining the spatial performance. To address this gap, this study employs fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to analyze the causality of UUS development. Three primary models of UUS development-separate, interconnected, and integrated models-are categorized. Causal conditions and outcomes along with their quantitative metrics are proposed. Subsequently, 30 Chinese cases are analyzed using fsQCA to assess the necessity and sufficiency of UUS development. Three distinct causal paths are identified, namely strong economic strength, robust policy support, and advanced construction technology, which play critical roles in integrated development, while weak economic strength and inadequate policy support lead to separate development. The study underscores the importance of implementing UUS development models and provides valuable insights for UUS planning management. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

One of these recent algorithms that is now believed to be promising metaheuristic algorithm is the White Shark Optimizer (WSO). Although it has produced a number of encouraging results, it has some certain downsides like other metaheuristic algorithms (MAs). Dropping into the local minimum optima and local solution zones, the uneven distribution of exploration and exploitation abilities, and the slow rate of convergence are some of these downsides. To fight those, two efficient mechanisms, i.e., Enhanced Solution Quality (ESQ) and Orthogonal Learning (OL), have been applied to develop an enhanced version of WSO called EWSO. The effectiveness of EWSO has been comprehensively evaluated using the IEEE CEC’2022 test suite. For further verification and achieving the principle of generality, the proposed algorithm has been used to provide good solutions for three engineering design issues (i.e., Gear train, Vertical deflection of an I beam, and the piston lever), for further applicability it has also been employed to solve two combinatorial optimization problems (i.e., bin packing problem (BPP) and quadratic assignment problems (QAP)). This effectiveness has been evaluated compared to the most recent and common metaheuristics, i.e., Kepler Optimization Algorithm (KOA), Seagull Optimization Algorithm (SOA), Spider Wasp Optimizer (SWO), and some well-known metaheuristic algorithms such as; Sine cosine Algorithm (SCA), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), and Trees Social Relations Optimization (TSR), in addition to the original SWO. The experimental results and statistical measures confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm (EWSO) in tackling real-world issues. It is able to overcome the previous drawbacks by providing the global optimum and preventing premature convergence through an increase in population diversity. © 2023 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS)"

Any vertex in this tree is called degree preserving if it has the same degree in the graph and in the tree. Building upon this concept, the Degree Preserving Spanning Tree Problem (DPSTP) asks for a spanning tree of G with as many degree preserving vertices as possible. DPSTP is very much intertwined with the most important application for it, so far, i.e., the online monitoring of arc flows in a water distribution network, what serves us as an additional motivation for our investigation. We show that degree preserving vertices correspond to a stable set of a properly defined DPSTP conflict graph. This, in turn, allows us to use valid inequalities for the Stable Set Polytope (SSP) and thus strengthen the DPSTP formulations previously suggested in the literature. In doing so, the Branch-and-cut and Benders Decomposition algorithms suggested for these formulations are greatly enhanced. Additionally, as a further contribution, we also introduce a new and very challenging set of DPSTP test instances, given by graphs that closely resemble water distribution networks. For these instances, the new algorithms very clearly outperform all previous DPSTP algorithms. They not only run faster than their competitors but are also less dependent on good initial DPSTP primal bounds. For previous DPSTP test sets, the new algorithms lag behind the best existing algorithm for them, which is based on Lagrangian relaxation. However, as compared to additional DPSTP previous algorithms that do not benefit from SSP inequalities, the new ones come much closer to the Lagrangian relaxation one. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Nevertheless, little has been reported on their practical applications in industries. This gap is largely due to restrictive assumptions of the maintenance policies. Two of the main assumptions are that maintenance is conducted on typical components and that the reliability of an item under maintenance is known (where the item can be a component or a system composed of multiple components). These assumptions do not often hold in the real world: maintenance is often performed on a collection of components such as an integrated circuit plate and the reliability of each individual component may not be known. To reduce these gaps, this paper develops a new maintenance policy for a collection of components and an approximate method to estimate the reliability of this collection based on the failure data collected from the field. The maintenance policy considers that a system is composed of three subsystems with different levels of maintenance effectiveness (i.e, minimal, imperfect, and perfect). The approximate estimate of the reliability of each subsystem is derived based on the failure data that are time between failures of the system but not those of the components that cause the system to fail. An algorithm for simulating the superposition of generalised renewal processes is then proposed. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the proposed approximation method. © 2024"

As an example, these paths could correspond to stops on a public transport network, and a query of interest is to retrieve paths that share at least k consecutive stops. While topological relations among spatial objects have received extensive attention, the efficient processing of these relations in the context of trajectory paths, considering both time and space efficiency, remains a relatively less explored domain. Taking inspiration from pattern matching implementations, the TRGST data structure is constructed on the foundation of the Generalized Suffix Tree. Its purpose is to provide a compact representation of a set of paths and to efficiently handle topological relation queries by leveraging the pattern search capabilities inherent in this structure. The paper provides a detailed account of the structure and algorithms of TRGST, followed by a performance analysis utilizing both real and synthetic data. The results underscore the remarkable scalability of the TRGST in terms of both query time and space utilization. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The production firm sells its products through hybrid channels and increases sales by using online and offline advertisements. A characteristic relation between online, offline, and buy-online-pick-up-in-store selling is found in the development of a dual-channel advertisement driven demand. The study first develops a crisp model that is extended into a fuzzy model to include the imprecise nature of the demand. The optimal values of the decision variables are derived using a classical optimization approach. The global optimality of the solutions are validated using Hessian matrix. Numerical analysis is performed to validate the models and their applications. Sensitivity analysis of the key parameters is performed.

With this background, a novel approach is presented for fostering excellence in physicians, aligning with the contemporary demands of our era. Methods: Self-administered questionnaire was used to facilitate the collection of data on medical advanced mathematics course offerings, distribution of teaching hours of each major and the perception of the course teaching system in 11 medical universities in China. The distribution of course offerings in each major was analyzed, and one-sample t-test was conducted on the perspectives of course offerings, content settings (theoretical & practical), educational objectives, teaching reforms, and Synthetical Sensation (SS) of the curriculum system and educational model. Results: The study included various specialties such as clinical medicine, pharmacy, public health, health management, and life sciences, all of which offered advanced mathematics course. The content of medical mathematics textbooks was designed to meet the practical needs of relevant professions, and encompass online laboratory classes and social practice. However, a noticeable misalignment was observed between the content of medical mathematics courses and the realistic requirements of professions (t = -3.614~-3.018, P < 0.05). The perceived difference in the completeness of curriculum systems was not significantly apparent. There was a difference in the perception of the effectiveness of teaching reforms (t = -4.485, P < 0.05), and there was a difference in the perception of the synthesis of the educational model in all cases (t = -5.067, P < 0.05). Conclusion: There are localized differences in curricula, and the number of course hours is basically reasonable; course content needs to be updated; the implementation of course objectives is not in place; the curriculum system can meet the needs of talent training; the innovation of the education model needs to be put into practice; and there are obvious differences in the comprehensive cognition of the teaching system and the education model.

Gridder-HO, the software designed to generate high-order curvilinear mesh efficiently and rapidly, has been developed. Gridder-HO supports the elevation of meshes to P2 (quadratic-order) or P3 (cubic-order). It features a layered architecture and utilizes the concurrent hash table and the Alternating Digital Tree (ADT) data structure, supporting thread-level parallelism to convert straight-edge mesh into high-order curvilinear mesh seamlessly. Gridder-HO utilizes the projection method based on a thread pool to precisely preserve geometry, and employs a novel localized RBF method with ADT for volume node interpolation to untangle the mesh, which aims to achieve a satisfactory balance between efficiency and accuracy. Validated through CFD simulations using the GPU-accelerated Python Flux Reconstruction (PyFR) solver, the practicality of Gridder-HO is demonstrated across various Reynolds numbers in typical cases such as sphere, cylinder, and SD7003 airfoil. These results confirm the high-order curvilinear meshes generated by Gridder-HO meet the high-order requirements of emerging computational methods.

The research simplifies a flexible beam with macro fiber composite (MFC) piezoelectric patches using a lumped-parameter approach and derives the dynamic equations of the system using the Lagrange equations. The incremental harmonic balance method (IHBM) is then employed to solve these equations, simulating the nonlinear dynamics involved in the harvested voltage. Key findings include the initial discovery of multiple voltage islands which are voltage jumps that improve energy conversion efficiency, confirmed by experimental data validating the IHBM simulations. The study reveals that these phenomena are due to the enhanced nonlinearities of the system, particularly the geometric nonlinearity caused by the spring k1 and the nonlinear magnetic force between magnets. Adjusting k1 allows the observation of multiple voltage islands, and increasing d0 results in a broad-frequency constant voltage, offering new insights.

This is primarily attributed to the accumulation of runtime errors, commonly referred to as aging-related bugs (ARBs). ARBP aims to detect and address ARBs before software release, optimizing testing resource allocation. However, ARBP's effectiveness relies heavily on dataset quality. Prior research often relied on manually designed metrics that lack semantic features, resulting in low prediction accuracy. Some studies construct models to learn semantic features from source code, but typically focus on token-level features from abstract Syntax Trees, neglecting critical topological and functional connections. In this paper, we introduce the SGT model, an ARBP method based on Graph-Transformer. This model efficiently extracts semantic information and logical structures from source code, capturing data dependencies and program dependencies. We also propose sub-graph sampling based on node degree to reduce structural complexity and apply random oversampling to address class imbalance. Experiments on three projects demonstrate notable improvements. For instance, SGT achieved F1 scores of 0.726 and 0.706 on Linux and MySQL, respectively. Compared to ALW, SGT shows a 12.3% and 6.8% improvement on Linux and MySQL. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

This study examines the relationship between the continued employment of married women with STEM or STEM-related majors in relevant occupations and their spouses having the same field of occupation/major, as well as the difference in this association when considering the presence of children. This study analyzed a sample comprising 147,467 married college-educated women aged 25–55 years. The analysis was restricted to women with a STEM or STEM-related major and a spouse who was college-educated and employed. All the data were drawn from the 2015–2019 waves of data released by the American Community Survey (ACS). The results reveal that spousal occupational similarity is positively associated with married women’s retention in STEM and STEM-related (healthcare) occupations. Moreover, the presence of children is a moderator variable in the relationship between women’s employment in STEM or STEM-related occupations and their spouses’ having STEM or STEM-related occupations.

In any case, inoculation has consistently been controversial, with differing opinions and viewpoints. This has compelled some individuals to decide against receiving the vaccine. These divergent viewpoints have had a trivial impact on the epidemic's dynamics and the disease's development. In response to vaccinated individuals still falling ill, many countries have implemented booster vaccines to protect further. In this specific investigation, a mathematical model composed of seven compartments is employed to examine the effectiveness of a booster dose in preventing and treating the transmission of COVID-19. The principles of mathematics are employed to analyse and investigate the dynamics of the disease. Using a qualitative prototype analysis, we acquired valuable insights into its effectiveness. One essential aspect is the basic reproduction number, a critical determinant of the disease's spread. This calculation is determined by studying the system's equilibrium and evaluating its stability. Furthermore, we examined the balance from a local and global viewpoint, considering the possibility of bifurcation and the model's reproductive number sensitivity index. Through numerical simulations, we have visually illustrated the analytical findings outlined in this research paper and presented a thorough examination of the efficacy of booster shots as a preventive and therapeutic measure in the spread dynamics of COVID-19. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Our investigation delves into morphological, optical properties, and sensing capabilities, aiming to optimize their use as efficient gas sensors. Morphological analysis revealed the development of unique surfaces with distinct characteristics compared to untreated sample, yielding substantially rougher yet flat surfaces, corroborated by Minkowski Functionals analysis. Fractal mathematics exploration emphasized that despite increased roughness, HF/ethanol-treated surfaces exhibit flatter attributes compared to untreated Si sample. Optical approaches established a correlation between increased porosity and elevated localized states and defects, influencing the Urbach energy value. This contributed to a reduction in steepness values, attributed to heightened dislocations and structural disturbances, while the transconductance parameter decreases. Simultaneously, porosity enhances the strength of electron‒phonon interaction. The porous silicon thin films were further tested as effective gas sensors for CO2 and O2 vapors at room temperature, displaying notable changes in electrical resistance with varying concentrations.

This paper presents a hybrid forecast methodology, the Saliency-Rough Fuzzy Utility Pattern recognition ensemble, in light of space-air-ground multi-source-heterogeneous input data. A parallel learning architecture is established and identifies the critical components with higher yields to enhance efficiency. Accordingly, more reasonable quantitative and qualitative evaluations can be carried out concurrently. Potential imprecise and uncertain data scenes are handled in quantitative assessments, both the failure hazard path sets and survival function likelihood boxes are incorporated in the designed relative path-Fussell Vesely Saliency (rp-FVS) model; and in qualitative analyses, the underlying perilous components can be distinguished via a combination of the variable precision-rough model. The rp-FVS-based fuzzy inference logic configures all membership functions identically according to components’ impacts. These two parts are integrated into the rough-fuzzy Utility Measure to discover concealed component-vulnerability interconnection patterns.

More specifically, we investigated changes in elementary school students’ physiological arousal during an arithmetic task and associations between these changes and students’ mindset, performance on the task, and math grades. We used a person-oriented approach to analyze the tonic electrodermal activity of 86 fourth graders, recorded while they were working on an arithmetic task. With model-based clustering of students’ on-task electrodermal activity, we identified three groups of students with differing temporal dynamics of physiological arousal during the task: Increasing Arousal, Decreasing Arousal and Decreasing and Increasing Arousal. The Decreasing Arousal profile contained more students classified as holding a Fixed Mindset Tendency than would be expected if physiological profile membership and mindset tendency were independent. The Increasing Arousal profile performed better on the task than the Decreasing Arousal profile. No association was found with math grades.

During the production process, the precise measurement of the dimensional parameters of annular forgings is of paramount importance to ensure their quality and safety. However, owing to the influence of the measurement environment, the manufacturing process of annular forgings can introduce varying degrees of noise, resulting in inaccurate dimensional measurements. Therefore, researching methods for three-dimensional point cloud data to eliminate noise in annular forging point clouds is of significant importance for improving the accuracy of forging measurements. This paper presents a denoising approach for three-dimensional point cloud data of annular forgings based on Grassmann manifold and density clustering (GDAD). First, within the Grassmann manifold, the core points for density clustering are determined using density parameters. Second, density clustering is performed within the Grassmann manifold, with the Cauchy distance replacing the Euclidean distance to reduce the impact of noise and outliers on the analysis results. Finally, a search tree model was constructed to filter out incorrect point cloud clusters. The fusion of clustering results and the search tree model achieved denoising of point cloud data. Simulation experiments on annular forgings demonstrate that GDAD effectively eliminates edge noise in annular forgings and performs well in denoising point-cloud models with varying levels of noise intensity. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd."

However, the nonlinear dynamics of the buckling click mechanism of the flapping robot with bistability still unclear. In this paper, a novel flapping robot model with the click mechanism proposed based on the bistability of snap-through buckling. The nonlinear governing equations of the flight robot are obtained by using the Euler–Lagrange equation. The nonlinear potential energy, moment of the elastic force, equilibrium bifurcation, as well as equilibrium stability are investigated to show the bistable characteristics. The transitional and persistent sets of bifurcation regions in the parameter plane and the corresponding phase portraits are obtained with single and double well behaviors. Then, the periodic response of the free flight are defined by the analytical solution of three kinds of elliptical functions, as well as the amplitude frequency responses are investigated by numerical integration. Based on the topological equivalent, the chaotic thresholds of the homo-clinic and heteroclinic orbits for the chaotic vibration of the perturbed robot system are derived. Finally, the prototype of nonlinear flapping robot is manufactured and the experimental system is setup. The nonlinear static moment of force curves, periodic response and dynamic flight vibration of dipteran robot system are carried out.

Researchers have studied customized network security frameworks and cyberattack detection tools driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) to counter different types of attacks, such as spoofing, data alteration, and botnet attacks. However, carrying out routine IoMT services and tasks during an under-attack scenario is challenging. Machine Learning has been extensively suggested for detecting cyberattacks in IoMT and IoT infrastructures. However, the conventional centralized approach in ML cannot effectively detect newly emerging attacks without compromising patient data privacy and network flow data confidentiality. Aim: This study discusses a Federated Bayesian Optimization XGBoost framework that employs multimodal sensory signals from patient vital signs and network flow data to detect attack patterns and malicious network traffic in IoMT infrastructure while ensuring data privacy and detecting previously unknown attacks. Methodology: The proposed model employs a Federated Bayesian Optimisation XGBoost approach, which allows us to search the parameter space quickly and find an optimal solution from each local server while aggregating the model parameters from each local server to the centralised server. The XGBoost algorithm generates a new tree by taking into account the previously estimated value for the tree's input data and then optimizing the prediction gain. This study used a dataset with 44 attributes and 16 318 instances. During the preprocessing phase, 10 features were dropped, and the remaining 34 features were used to evaluate the network flows and biometric data (patient vital signs). Results: The performance evaluation reveals that the proposed model predicts data alteration, malware, and spoofing attacks in patients' vital signs and network flow data with a prediction accuracy of 0.96. The results obtained from the experiment demonstrate that both the centralized and federated models are synchronized, with the latter occasionally being slightly reduced. Conclusion: The findings indicate that the suggested model can be incorporated into the IoMT domain to detect malicious patterns while maintaining data privacy and confidentiality efficiently. © 2024 The Author(s)"

In this paper we investigate the finite sum of cosecants ∑csc⁡(φ+aπl/n), where the summation index l runs through 1 to n−1 and φ and a are arbitrary parameters, as well as several closely related sums, such as similar sums of a series of secants, of tangents and of cotangents. These trigonometric sums appear in various problems in mathematics, physics, and a variety of related disciplines. Their particular cases were fragmentarily considered in previous works, and it was noted that even a simple particular case ∑csc⁡(πl/n) does not have a closed–form, i.e. a compact summation formula (similar sums of sines, of cosines, of tangents, of cotangents and even of secants, if they exist, possess such expressions). In this paper, we derive several alternative representations for the above–mentioned sums, study their properties, relate them to many other finite and infinite sums, obtain their complete asymptotic expansions for large n and provide accurate upper and lower bounds (e.g. the typical relative error for the upper bound is lesser than 2×10−9 for n⩾10 and lesser than 7×10−14 for n⩾50, which is much better than the bounds we could find in previous works). Our researches reveal that these sums are deeply related to several special numbers and functions, especially to the digamma function (furthermore, as a by-product, we obtain several interesting summation formulæ for the digamma function). Asymptotical studies show that these sums may have qualitatively different behaviour depending on the choice of φ and a.

Finally, we also provide several historical remarks related to various sums considered in the paper.

This problem can be modeled in two phases: firstly, a selection of paths in the network and, secondly, an interval coloring problem in the edge intersection graph of these paths. The interval chromatic number equals the smallest size of a spectrum such that a proper interval coloring is possible, the weighted clique number is a natural lower bound. Graphs where both parameters coincide for all possible non-negative integral weights are called superperfect. Therefore, the occurrence of non-superperfect edge intersection graphs of routing paths can provoke the need of larger spectral resources. In this work, we examine the question which minimal non-superperfect graphs can occur in the edge intersection graphs of routing paths in different underlying networks: when the network is a path, a tree, a cycle, or a sparse planar graph with small maximum degree. We show that for any possible network (even if it is restricted to a path) the resulting edge intersection graphs are not necessarily superperfect. We close with a discussion of possible consequences and of some lines of future research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Source localization is crucial for suppressing the spread of negative information, however, existing research on source localization has overlooked the theory of network structural balance. In this paper, we leverage the theory of structural balance in signed networks to develop a framework for source localization. This framework, called Direction Induced Search and Source Identification based Label Propagation (DISLPSI), consists of two main components: the Direction Induced Search (DIS) algorithm constructs a relaxed-induced search tree, and the Source Identification based Label Propagation (LPSI) algorithm validates the propagation source within the search tree. Meanwhile, in order to improve the proximity between the relaxed direction-induced search tree and the real propagation path, we propose the Adaptive Observation Node Selection (AONS) algorithm. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the original LPSI algorithm performs very poorly in signed networks, proving that LPSI cannot be directly applied to signed networks. Conversely, the DISLPSI framework is effective in accurately localizing the source and robustness against the structural balance. Furthermore, the observer nodes selected by the AONS algorithm significantly enhance the source localization. We also find that the source localization framework is more advantageous in homogeneous networks than in heterogeneous networks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

In particular, when processors communicate by message passing and the communication links are unbounded, fake messages may be placed in communication links by an adversary. When the number of such fake messages is unknown, self-stabilization may require huge resources: • generic solutions (a.k.a. data link protocols) require unbounded resources, which makes them unrealistic to deploy, • specific solutions (e.g., census or tree construction) require O(nlog⁡n) or O(Δlog⁡n) bits of memory per node, where n denotes the network size and Δ its maximum degree, which may prevent scalability. We investigate the possibility of resource-efficient self-stabilizing protocols in this context. Specifically, we present self-stabilizing protocols for (Δ+1)-coloring and maximal independent set construction in any n-node graph, under the asynchronous message-passing model. The problems of (Δ+1)-coloring and maximal independent set construction are widely regarded as benchmark problems for evaluating local algorithms. Our protocols offer many desirable features. They are deterministic, converge in O(kΔn2log⁡n) message exchanges, where k is the (unknown) initial number of (possibly corrupted) messages in a communication link. They use messages of O(log⁡log⁡n+log⁡Δ) bits with a memory of O(Δlog⁡Δ+log⁡log⁡n) bits at each node. The resource consumption of our protocols is thus almost oblivious to the number of nodes, enabling scalability. Moreover, a striking property of our protocols is that the nodes do not need to know the number, or any bound on the number of messages initially present in each communication link of the initial (potentially corrupted) network configuration. This permits our protocols to handle any future network with unknown message capacity communication links. A key building block of our coloring and maximal independent set schemes is an algorithm to obtain an acyclic orientation of graph edges, that is of independent interest, and can serve as a useful tool for solving other tasks in this challenging setting. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

This odd viscosity effect is vital in conventional fluids when there is a disruption in time-reversal symmetry. Our motivation to study the dynamics with odd viscosity arises from recent studies (Kirkinis & Andreev, vol. 878, 2019, pp. 169–189; Chattopadhyay & Ji, vol. 455, 2023, pp. 133883) where the odd viscosity effectively reduces flow instabilities under different scenarios. Utilizing a long wave perturbation method, we derive a nonlinear evolution equation at the liquid–air interface, which is influenced by the motion of the vertical plate, imposed shear, odd viscosity, and inertia. We first perform a linear stability analysis of the model to get firsthand information on various flow parameters. Three distinct conditions for the vertical plate, quiescent, upward-moving, and downward-moving, are considered, accounting the imposed shear and odd viscosity. Additionally, employing the method of multiple scales, we conduct a weakly nonlinear stability analysis for the traveling wave solution of the evolution equation and explore its bifurcation analysis. The bifurcation analysis reveals the existence of subcritical unstable and supercritical stable zones for crucial flow parameters: odd viscosity, imposed shear, and motion of the vertical plate. Both linear and weakly nonlinear stability analyses demonstrate that the destabilizing effect induced by the upward motion of the vertical plate can be alleviated by applying uphill shear, while the destabilizing effect of downhill shear can be mitigated when the vertical plate is in a downward motion. Moreover, we define an eigenvalue problem that mirrors the Orr–Sommerfeld (OS) model for analyzing normal modes and identifying the critical Reynolds number. We investigate the dynamics of surface waves through numerical solutions of the OS eigenvalue problem using the Chebyshev spectral collocation method. We observe the consistent enhancement of stabilization in the presence of odd viscosity. In the low to moderate Reynolds number range, vertical plate motion and odd viscosity show similar behavior in OS analysis, while imposed shear exhibits distinct changes. The Benney-type model does not agree with the OS problem when the Reynolds number is moderate with or without the three key parameters: vertical plate motion, imposed shear, and odd viscosity. However, when the Reynolds number is low with or without the three key parameters: vertical plate motion, imposed shear, and odd viscosity, the Benney-type model agrees with the OS. Further, numerical simulations of the evolution equation corroborate the results obtained from linear stability, weakly nonlinear stability, and OS analyses. Finally, the Hopf bifurcation analysis of the fixed point reveals that the wave speed is influenced by both the motion of the plate and the imposed shear while it remains independent of odd viscosity. © 2024"

As one of the most promising unsupervised learning methods in machine intelligence, existing clustering methods cannot simultaneously handle datasets with arbitrary shapes, different densities, distinct sizes, and overlapping. Background outliers and high dimensionality make clustering problems more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel universal clustering methodology, called G2-SCANN, which yields the best clustering performance for all 30 synthetic and real datasets without any hyperparameter tuning if the exact number of clusters is known. Firstly, the shortest path length (SPL) in complex network or graph-based geodesic distance is used to give a locally backbone-structured description of graph vertex similarity. Accordingly, SPL-weighted local degree (SLD) is defined as vertex attributes of a SPL-weighted graph expressed by G2-SPL adjacency matrix with ε-natural neighbourhood. Secondly, the process of calculating SLD for every data point in a bottom-up way directly leads to division from a complete graph constituted by all data points to a group of SLD trees. This brings the interpretability and the elimination of lone trees. Thirdly, contrastive learning of largest SLD values for finding root vertices of each divisive tree is conducted and top-down category message is then transmitted from the root vertices to all the leaf ones of a SLD tree. It eventually produces tree-like clusters. Totally, the proposed G2-SCANN method leverages both local neighbouring similarity of data points and global information about data distribution and makes it perform better than other methods. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Tree-based key/value storage management structures became particularly popular in storage engines. B+-Trees allow constant search performance, however write-heavy workloads yield inefficient write patterns to secondary storage devices and poor performance characteristics. LSM-Trees overcome this issue by horizontal partitioning fractions of data — small enough to fully reside in main memory, but require frequent maintenance to sustain search performance. To this end, firstly, we propose Multi-Version Partitioned BTrees (MV-PBT) as sole storage and index management structure in key-sorted storage engines like Key/Value-Stores. Secondly, we compare MV-PBT against LSM-Trees. The logical horizontal partitioning in MV-PBT allows leveraging recent advances in modern B+-Tree techniques in a small transparent and memory resident portion of the structure. Structural properties sustain steady read performance, even on historical data, and yield efficient write patterns as well as reduced write-amplification. We integrate MV-PBT in the WiredTiger key/value storage engine. MV-PBT offers an up to 2x increased steady throughput in comparison to LSM-Trees and several orders of magnitude in comparison to B+-Trees in a YCSB workload. Moreover, MV-PBT exhibits robust time-travel query performance and outperforms LSM-Trees by 20% and B+-Trees by an order of magnitude. © 2024 The Authors"

Floating net cages are one of the traditional methods commonly used by Indonesian fishermen for river fish farming. Increased human activities along the Musi River and coastline have resulted in pollution and waste in the river waters and fluctuating water quality. Yet, floating net cage owners still manually assess the water quality. This study aims to develop an early warning system for water quality and create a decision-making program as a reference for fishermen to relocate floating net cages when the river water quality deteriorates. METHODS: The device was tested at 39 locations within a radius of approximately 3400 meters, and the distance between locations varied between 55 and 334 meters. The river was divided into three sections: the river coast, the middle section, and the other river coast. Water quality sensors were placed at a depth of 0-20 centimeters from the surface of the Musi River, with measurement durations at each location ranging from 1 to 40 minutes. Direct measurements of the Musi River’s water quality were obtained by monitoring the water quality using an internet-based computer application. A decision-making Python program utilizing fuzzy logic was then executed to evaluate the suitability of the river water quality for fish cultivation. The program’s input variables comprise water temperature, potential of hydrogen, and dissolved oxygen sensor data. Meanwhile, the program output recommends floating net cage owners to either “Stay in position” or “Move.” Water quality warnings that exceed the upper and lower threshold limits are displayed using light-emitting diode indicators and a buzzer. FINDINGS: Overall, the water quality values of the Musi River at the test locations generally indicated stable and suitable conditions for river fish cultivation. The average water quality values were 29.20 degrees Celsius for temperature, 3.98 milligrams per liter for dissolved oxygen, and a potential of hydrogen of 6.42. From all the data obtained during the decision-making program, 36 locations suggested that the floating net cages should “Stay in position.” Meanwhile, the three remaining locations were recommended to “Move” as they exhibited poor water quality, with potential of hydrogen values below 6. Field observations indicated that these locations were situated near residential areas, factories/industries, and tributaries, which are highly susceptible to waste and pollution. The output of the decision-making program correlated with the issued warnings by the water quality warning indicators when the pH value exceeded the lower threshold limit. CONCLUSION: The fuzzy logic method implemented in the Python program for decision-making regarding the relocation of floating net cages in river fish farming revealed the fluctuating water quality conditions of the Musi River within a specific time duration. These conditions correlated with the proximity of the water bodies to pollution sources such as residential areas, factories, and tributaries. The program’s output classified the status of the floating net cages into two conditions: “Stay in position” or “Move.” The decision-making application to relocate floating net cages for fish farming in rivers provides a solution for fishermen as the resulting program decisions give the same indication as the reading value of the water quality sensor. © 2024 ©2024 The author(s).

In a similar context, this study explores the adoption of GAI barriers through two studies by a mixed-method approach. The first study is based on YouTube datasets of selected videos where GAI adoption challenges, problems, and barriers were discussed. Further, these YouTube datasets were analysed through text mining and empirical modelling techniques. In the second study, an extensive literature review was done and critical barriers to GAI adoption were identified based on the extensive literature review. Further, these barriers were analysed through three theoretical lenses and a hybrid fuzzy multicriteria decision-making approach.

The proposed method formulates airway labeling as a branch classification problem in the airway tree graph, where branch features are extracted using convolutional neural networks and enriched using graph neural networks. Our graph neural network is structure-aware by having each node aggregate information from its local neighbors and position-aware by encoding node positions in the graph. We evaluated the proposed method on 220 airway trees from subjects with various severity stages of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The results demonstrate that our approach is computationally efficient and significantly improves branch classification performance than the baseline method. The overall average accuracy of our method reaches 91.18% for labeling 18 segmental airway branches, compared to 83.83% obtained by the standard CNN method and 87.37% obtained by the existing method. Furthermore, the reader study done on an additional set of 40 subjects shows that our algorithm performs comparably to human experts in labeling segmental-airways.

In structural mechanics, group theory has been successfully employed to simplify problems of the bifurcation, stability, statics, kinematics and vibration of symmetric configurations of space frames, space truss domes, double-layer and triple-layer space grids, plates and cable-net systems. Besides significantly reducing computational effort, group theory affords deeper insights on structural behaviour, and a better understanding of complex structural phenomena. The key to group-theoretic simplification is the decomposition of the space of the problem into independent subspaces that are spanned by symmetry-adapted variables obtained by applying idempotents of the symmetry group on the normal variables of the problem. However, for degenerate subspaces of a symmetry group (i.e. subspaces associated with repeating solutions), the associated idempotents do not sufficiently decompose the problem. The aim of this paper is to present, for the C3v symmetry group describing the symmetry of a regular 3-sided polygon, a pair of algebraic operators that fully decompose such subspaces. Compared with existing group-theoretic formulations, these operators offer an alternative approach that is simpler and more suited to practical engineering computations, and that affords clearer insights on the physical characteristics of the structural system (such as type of symmetries within the degenerate subspaces). The validity of the operators is confirmed through comparisons with results of eigenvalue vibration and stability problems drawn from the literature. © 2024"

The first problem is the belief entropies have rarely been exploited to induce a belief Jensen divergence family. We provide a solution by proposing two general paradigms, i.e. the “I-P-E” (Information theory-Probability theory-Evidence theory) and “E-E” (Evidence theory-Evidence theory) paradigms. Particularly, the “E-E” paradigm defines the first belief Jensen divergence family that is induced by belief entropies. The second problem is the “E-E” paradigm has rarely been generalized to multiple evidence-based belief Jensen divergences. We settle it by proposing a new Belief Jensen-PGDI (Pignistic Gini Deng Impurity) divergence as a gap filler. To ensure the divergence's feasibility in mathematics, we make two auxiliary works: the Enhanced Pignistic transformation is refined, and a new belief entropy called PGDI is constructed. Several axiomatic properties are also proven for the new divergence, guaranteeing its theoretical rigorousness. We successfully apply this divergence in two evidence fusion challenges, empirically verifying its practicality. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Among them, the classic rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm has derivative algorithms (e.g., RRT*, Q-RRT*, and F-RRT*) that focus on the optimal path cost of the initial solution. Other improved algorithms, such as RRT-connect and BG-RRT, focus on the optimal time of the initial solution. This article proposes an improved density gradient-RRT (DG-RRT) algorithm based on RRT that improves the efficiency of the guide point and reduces the time lost in the process of obtaining the initial solution through the dynamic gradient sampling strategy. Simultaneously, it reduces the path cost by reconstructing the output path. The proposed algorithm is an expansion algorithm of a random tree, and the performance of the algorithm can be further improved by combining it with other RRT optimization algorithms. DG-RRT and other algorithms are compared in different environments through simulation experiments to verify the advantages of DG-RRT.

K-means method is widely used in clustering analysis due to its simplicity, high efficiency, and scalability, but it needs to specify the number of clusters in advance, and is sensitive to the initial clustering centers. The current initialization method does not take into account the neighborhood distribution of the data points, and the direct use of data that has undergone dimensionality reduction processing leads to inaccurate selection of the initial clustering centers. To address the above problems, a new K-means improvement method that takes into account the initialization problem and the adaptive determination of the number of clusters: K-means clustering method based on nearest-neighbor density matrix is proposed in this paper. The method improves the efficiency of nearest neighbor search by building a K-D tree, and enhances the performance of unsupervised classification by utilizing the adaptive selection strategy of the number of clusters and the initial clustering centers selection algorithm. The proposed method is applied to real datasets, and its effectiveness is assessed by calculating three clustering evaluation metrics of the clustering results in comparison with several existing initialization and clustering methods. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has higher stability and better clustering performance than existing clustering methods. © 2024 The Authors"

For this aim, the trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are used to show the values of inputs and outputs. An intuitionistic fuzzy number is characterized by membership, non-membership, and hesitancy degrees. Therefore, such type of fuzzy numbers is more complete and contains more information to reflect a fuzzy type of uncertainty comparing to the conventional fuzzy values. In order to solve the proposed intuitionistic fuzzy CCR-IO model, for the first time a possibility-based approach is developed for the intuitionistic fuzzy DEA models. In this approach for the first time the ME measure of fuzzy events is extended to intuitionistic fuzzy DEA models, therefore, some new definitions and propositions are presented and clarified. This measure is more flexible and effective comparing to the other measures such as credibility, necessity, and possibility measures. A case study from the health care sector of Iran is considered to evaluate the proposed solution approach numerically. The case study is solved under different scenarios, a full sensitivity analysis is performed, and finally some useful managerial insights are presented.

Two critical requirements are identified: 1) The model must exhibit high interpretability to mitigate the adverse effects of incorrect diagnoses; and 2) practical applications often suffer from insufficient samples and noise in rice leaf disease datasets, which requires the model to have strong generalization ability and robustness. However, existing methods still have certain limitations in practical scenarios due to a lack of comprehensive consideration of interpretability, generalization ability, and robustness. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel knowledge correction and ε-insensitive criterion-leveraged zero-order TSK fuzzy system (0-TSK-FS), named KE-0-TSK-FS. The KE-0-TSK-FS method is developed with 0-TSK-FS as the baseline, enhancing the generalization ability of the model by introducing the knowledge correction method and its iterative learning strategy to extract more information from limited samples. In addition, the objective function based on the ε-insensitive criterion makes KE-0-TSK-FS exhibit robustness when the samples contain noise. On three rice leaf disease datasets and six real-world non-rice leaf disease datasets, experiments were conducted on three metrics, namely accuracy, GM, and rule complexity. The experimental results show that the KE-0-TSK-FS method outperforms other comparative algorithms in terms of generalization ability, interpretability, and robustness in the diagnosis of rice leaf diseases under insufficient samples and noise situations, and its average accuracy on rice leaf disease datasets is nearly 3% higher than that of other comparative algorithms. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The method does not assume random arrivals and does not assume any primary parameters or estimation of any parameters but uses simple algebraic expressions that only depend on signal timing. For an approach lane at a traffic intersection, the conditional queue lengths given probe vehicle location, count, time, and analysis interval (e.g., at the end of the red signal phase) are represented by a Negative Hypergeometric distribution. The simple analytical estimators obtained are compared with parametric methods from literature and highway capacity manual methods using field test data and simulation data involving probe vehicles. The analysis indicates that the nonparametric models presented in this paper match the accuracy of the parametric ones used in the field test and simulated data for estimating queue lengths. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, when dealing with datasets containing multiple peaks, DPC may subjectively choose the wrong cluster centers through the decision graph. Additionally, DPC requires a considerable amount of time to estimate density and relative distance. Moreover, DPC is sensitive to the value of cut-off distance. To overcome these issues, a density peaks clustering algorithm based on density voting and neighborhood diffusion (DPC-DVND) is proposed. Firstly, the proposed algorithm utilizes the k nearest neighbors and KD-tree to enhance the efficiency of computing local density and relative distance. Secondly, this study selects the potential cluster centers by density voting and applies the number of votes instead of density to calculate the feasibility of each potential center becoming a cluster center, so that the centers of low-density clusters can be better distinguished. Finally, two neighborhood density diffusion rules are designed to propagate labels and form the core structure of clusters. Experiments on synthetic, real, and image datasets are performed to compare different methods. Results show that DPC-DVND outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

The bionic circuit constructed by membrane theory frequently employs an invariable capacitor to characterize the electrophysiological behaviors of the neuron membrane. Actually, the thickness and medium property of a neuron membrane are regulated by its membrane potential, which leads to the invariable capacitor suffering from inaccuracy in expressing the regulating process. To solve this issue, a memcapacitive emulator with controllable capacitance is deployed to characterize the neuron membrane in this paper. Then, a memcapacitive and memristive emulator-based (MC-MR-emulator-based) bionic circuit is first built, which involves only a memcapacitive emulator, a locally active memristive emulator, a DC voltage source, and an externally applied current stimulus. Numerical explorations display that the MC-MR-emulator-based bionic circuit can generate rich bifurcation behaviors, e.g., period-doubling bifurcation, tangent bifurcation, and crisis scenario, related to the current stimulus, memristive emulator parameters, and memcapacitive emulator parameters. These bifurcation behaviors lead to that the MC-MR-emulator-based bionic circuit can produce abundant periodic and chaotic spiking activities. In analog experiments, memcapacitor and memristor emulators are utilized. PCB-based hardware experimental results well address the validity of the numerical explorations and further exhibit the effectiveness of the MC-MR-emulator-based bionic circuit in generating spiking activities. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Traditional sampling-based planning algorithms have been extensively investigated, but they still often struggle in highly constrained environments. To address the issue, this paper introduces an Adaptive Multi-Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (AMRRT*) approach. The core idea is to adaptively improve the subtree generation, selection, and planning within the multi-tree sampling structure so that the configuration space can be explored more efficiently. During subtree generation, an information gain-based method is proposed to select appropriate locations for generating subtrees, minimizing sampling in areas that have been relatively fully explored. For subtree selection, the upper-confidence bound (δ) method is leveraged to balance global exploration and local exploitation. Additionally, a dynamic subtree planning method is developed to update the sampling direction and step size to increase the possibility of forming feasible paths. The theoretical proofs of the probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality for the AMRRT* approach are provided. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct a series of experiments against the state-of-the-art motion planning algorithms within 2D to 6D robotic configuration space. The results demonstrate AMRRT*’s superior performance on key metrics including computational efficiency and success rate, suggesting its promising potential in addressing complex motion planning challenges. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

This model provides insight into the complex dynamics of systems such as the wire-sawing of soft material, or a pipe conveying fluid resting on distributed soft supports. The unilateral foundation, when it is distributed along the longitudinal/transport axis of the string, induces a strong non-linearity and results in complex dynamics, especially when compared to the well-studied case of a bilateral foundation. The piecewise-linear partial differential equation governing the motion is derived and solved in the presence of a gyroscopic term that arises due to the simultaneous transverse and longitudinal motion of the continuous structure.

A novel family of SLMMs is further synthesized. The mobility analysis of a selected 7R SLMM is carried out via screw theory. The kinematics and bifurcation phenomena are analyzed and verified through numerical simulation using computer-aided design models. To evaluate the performance of the SLMMs, the mapping relationship between key design parameters and performance indicators, such as the grasping angle, folding angle, and mechanical advantage, is studied. A networking method is then proposed by considering the geometric coordination conditions and variation of the overconstraints of SLMMs. Prototypes of an SLMM and manipulator with optimal geometrical parameters are developed to verify the feasibility and correctness of the proposed method and kinematic analysis. © 2024"

In this device, multiple L-shaped piezoelectric beams are connected in a head-to-tail manner. Such a special stacked structure reduces the natural frequency of the system while realizing the series connection of multiple piezoelectric sheets in a limited space, thus improving the acquisition efficiency. Additionally, magnetic coupling endows the harvester with tri-stability and consequently enhances the bandwidth responses in low-frequency environments. The mathematical model is developed, and the static behaviors are explored by the bifurcation theory. Furthermore, the complex dynamic frequency method combined with the arc length method is conducted to investigate the dynamic responses with different parameters. Sinusoidal excitation experiments on the prototype verify the rationality of the mathematical model and the low-frequency broadband capability of the harvester. In the experiments, the designed harvester can reach a maximum output power of 1.49 mW at the low excitation amplitude of 0.4 g, and the magnet coupling significantly enhanced the electrical responses. The human motion tests demonstrate that the designed harvester has the potential to convert biomechanical energy into electrical energy for continuous powering of wireless devices. © 2024"

The version of the RRT algorithm presented in the article is called Multiplatform Spacetime RRT*. The proposed modifications make it possible to determine the flight trajectory of UAVs taking into account time constraints related to the area occupied by each platform. Additionally, the proposed algorithm ensures the avoidance of potential collisions of platforms in the air by using a collision avoidance algorithm used in practice based on geometric methods. Two designed and tested modifications of RRT were presented, based on the basic RRT* and Informed RRT* algorithms. The algorithm used in both tested versions guarantees the determination of the optimal flight path for unmanned platforms in a finite, small number of steps, which solely depends on the number of UAVs involved. This algorithm takes into account the dynamic model of the fixed-wing UAV. The simulation results presented by planning the flight trajectory of a swarm, consisting of three and four UAVs using the Multiplatform Spacetime RRT* algorithm, are significantly better than the algorithms that were compared to achieve these results. © The Author(s) 2024."

Graph-based approaches are widely acknowledged for their robust performance in outlier detection, yet constructing a comprehensive graph to represent the original data remains challenging. Some methods rely solely on the global distribution of the data, leading to low detection accuracy; in addition, when incorporating the local information of the data, the problem of dangling links may arise. To improve the graph construction process, this paper proposes an outlier detection algorithm based on a hybrid graph (HGOD). First, the neighbors of each object are obtained in an adaptive manner, and a neighborhood graph is created. Subsequently, a global connectivity graph is constructed using a minimum spanning tree. Then, these two graphs are merged into a hybrid graph, and Markov random walks are conducted on it. Finally, outliers are identified based on the converged stationary distribution. The performance of HGOD is evaluated on both real-world and synthetic datasets. The precision and AUC of HGOD algorithm surpasses that of the other seven algorithms. Ablation and analysis experiments further demonstrate that the HGOD algorithm is effective and has outstanding performance in outlier detection. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Comparing an experimental group that used GeoGebra with a control group receiving traditional teaching, key competencies such as reasoning and argumentation, communication, representation and modeling, and problem posing and solving were evaluated. Pre-intervention results showed that 88.19% of students in the experimental group had insufficient performance in reasoning and argumentation. After the implementation of GeoGebra, this figure decreased to 5.5%. In competencies of communication, representation, and modeling, the insufficient performance reduced from 85.7% to 5.5%, and in problem posing and solving, from 80.3% to 5.7%. These significant improvements demonstrate the positive impact of GeoGebra on the development of mathematical competencies. The study concludes that GeoGebra is an effective tool for strengthening trigonometric competence in high school students, highlighting the importance of integrating digital technologies in mathematics education.

Subsequently, diagnosability is reframed as a measurement of residual variance in the probability distribution. To address the absence of Maximum Mean Difference (MMD) in covariance difference measurement, Maximum Covariance Difference (MCD) is introduced. Furthermore, a method for quantitatively evaluating diagnosability based on MMCD is proposed, incorporating both MMD and MCD.

However, the chemical composition and medicinal value of Fritillaria can vary significantly depending on the variety and origin. Therefore, there is a need for a more efficient and accurate method to identify Fritillaria of different varieties and origins. This study employed a portable near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer to collect NIR spectral data on six kinds of Fritillaria and classify them by using different feature extraction methods. In order to circumvent the limitations of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in small-sample size problem and improve the classification accuracy, Fuzzy Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (FGSVD) was proposed for feature extraction from NIR spectra. The original NIR data were first pre-processed by the Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering, and then their dimensionality was reduced by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). After that, Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD) and FGSVD were performed for feature extraction, respectively. In the end, the spectral data were classified into six categories using the k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifier and Extreme Learning Machines (ELM). The results of the study showed that FGSVD had the highest classification accuracy when using the KNN classifier and was able to achieve 100 % classification accuracy. At the same time, GSVD and LDA were able to achieve 97.5 % and 92.5 % classification accuracy respectively. The classification accuracy obtained by FGSVD was also higher than GSVD and LDA when ELM was used. The highest classification accuracies obtained by FGSVD, GSVD and LDA were 96.9 %, 94.2 % and 92.3 % respectively. Thus, the KNN classifier outperformed ELM in classification. Consequently, the portable near-infrared spectrometer coupled with PCA+FGSVD is a novel strategy for rapid and non-destructive classification of Fritillaria. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The under-researched causal relations among enablers are seen through the lenses of the structural contingency theory (SCT) and the Context-Intervention-Mechanism-Outcome (CIMO) logic.

Although prior work has investigated parental predictors of home math engagement more broadly, it remains understudied whether the same factors relate to toddlers’ home math environment, and if home math experiences are associated with toddlers’ math skills. Here we asked whether parents’ beliefs, attitudes, and experiences with math relate to their engagement in home numeracy and spatial activities with toddlers and are associated with toddlers’ developing number and spatial skills (N = 189). We find that a broad range of parent factors, including parents’ beliefs about the importance of math, math growth mindset beliefs, math anxiety, and math coursework, predicts parents’ frequency of engaging in numeracy activities with toddlers. Furthermore, home number activities predicted toddlers’ number skills. Parents’ math beliefs, attitudes, and experiences all had positive indirect effects on toddlers’ number skills through associations with number activities. However, none of these parent factors predicted home spatial activities, and we saw no association between home spatial activities and toddlers’ spatial skills. Altogether, these results suggest that even at very young ages, parent factors shape the home environment and toddlers’ early numeracy learning, but we did not detect associations for spatial skills. © 2024"

Currently, the predominant numerical analysis used worldwide for the problems of wave-seabed interaction and seawater-structure-seabed interaction is primarily the one-way coupling method. While only a few two-way coupled models are being developed. Consequently, two issues are brought up: (1) For the cases involving small deformation and displacement, the degree of discrepancy can't be quantitatively identified between the results obtained respectively from one-way coupling models and two-way coupled models which are more rigorous in mathematics and physics. (2) For the cases involving large deformation and displacement, one-way coupling models should be non-applicable. To address this problem, this study first proposes an explicit two-way coupling theory for the fluid-structure-seabed interaction. Then, a two-way coupled numerical model is developed by integrating the soil-structure dynamics software FssiCAS, and an OpenFOAM-based CFD solver OlaFlow by utilizing the data exchange library preCICE. This two-way coupled model has been embedded into the software FssiCAS. The reliability of the developed two-way coupled model is systematically validated through a rigorous verification process. Subsequently, a comparative study is conducted between the newly developed two-way coupled model and the existing one-way coupling model, to investigate the ocean wave-seabed interaction, as well as the interaction process between ocean wave, a breakwater, and seabed foundation. A comprehensive analysis is performed by comparing the differences in the wave profiles in fluid domain, dynamic displacement of structure and seabed foundation, seepage, pore pressure accumulation, and liquefaction in seabed foundation solved by the two-way and one-way coupled models. Finally, the suitability of the one-way and two-way coupled models in different applicable scenarios was discussed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are costly and have low resolution, whereas electromagnetic NDT methods are more suitable for high-resolution detection and imaging. However, solving the highly nonlinear electromagnetic inverse scattering problems (ISPs) for small-sized defects with high contrast is challenging. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved subspace optimization algorithm based on a ResNet network called SOM-ResNet. SOM-ResNet incorporates physical principles into deep learning networks by simulating the iterative process of induced current and contrast, thereby enhancing its ability to accurately detect small objects with high contrast.

First, to save communication resources, the event-triggered control is proposed to ensure the consensus of MASs, where the trigger condition is established based on the neighbors’ information. The approximation properties of neural networks are used to address the unknown dynamics and external disturbances. Second, rigorous theoretical analysis proves that the MASs can achieve the leader-following consensus, as long as the communication graph of MASs contains a spanning tree with the leader as the root node.

In this paper, a comprehensive PEMFC system control-oriented model with parameter identification is developed, which includes various subsystems and components such as the hydrogen supply subsystem, air supply subsystem, thermal management subsystem. To investigate temperature control strategy by the thermal management subsystem, the energy balance equation is used for the PEMFC stack, water tank and radiator to reflect the transient temperature variation during the operation. Four typical temperature control strategies are implemented on the thermal management subsystem and their performances are evaluated in terms of temperature profiles, overshoot and integral absolute error criterion (IAE). Besides, this paper also considers the parasitic power of the fan under different control strategies. It is found that among the four strategies, Case 4 has the best performance on the controlling both water pump and fan with the PID. To improve the control effect further, fuzzy control is introduced to optimize the PID controller of the pump, and the radial basis function (RBF) neural network is introduced to optimize the PID controller of the fan. The results demonstrate that Fuzzy-PID and RBF-PID can achieve a better control effect with 22.66% decrease in IAE of Tst (stack temperature) and 77.56% decrease in IAE of Tin (inlet cooling water temperature). © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

A total of 173 parents and their preschool children (Mage = 4 years) from lower socioeconomic households were video-recorded participating in three STEM-related activities: (a) a pretend grocery store activity, (b) a bridge-building challenge, and (c) a book read about a science topic. Parent questions were categorized as open or closed according to the presence of key question terms. Results indicate that the three activities elicited different frequencies of parent open and closed questions, with the grocery store activity containing the most open and closed questions. Children's science knowledge was predicted by the frequency and proportion of parent open questions during the book read.

Specifically, we quantified children's metacognitive skills across these topics, examined whether these skills are topic-specific, and determined how these skills covary with domain-general executive functioning. A total of 80 elementary school children (Mage = 7.70 years, SD = 0.69) provided trial-by-trial performance data and confidence judgments on equivalence and fraction problems as well as assessments of executive function.

In this work, a microfluidic chip that can dynamically generate and capture microdroplets and form static microdroplet array was designed and fabricated. An optimized Christmas tree structure by adjusting the horizontal channel length ratio was used to generate a chemical concentration gradient while obtaining a uniform outlet flow rate, forming a droplet array with different concentrations. The performance of droplet array with microfluidic concentration gradient (DA-MCG) was verified using sodium fluorescein as a model reagent.

Therefore, in this study it aimed to design a fast radix-16 Booth multiplier based on the FPGA architecture. Booth multiplier implementation is preferred because it is relatively simple and efficient. The sizes of the multiplexers, which have an impact on the operating period in the encoder part of the proposed multiplier, reduced in the designed architecture by using a simple algorithm. To increase the speed performance of the system, the pipeline technique is used and parallelization is preferred in the tree structure in addition of the partial products.

An Adaptive Multi-meme Memetic Algorithm (AMMA) is proposed to tackle PC-GMSTP, which combines an adaptive reproduction procedure and a collaborated local search procedure. The adaptive reproduction procedure uses either crossover or mutation to produce offspring to maintain a good balance between exploration and exploitation of the search space, and the probability to use crossover or mutation is adaptively adjusted based on the diversity of population. The collaborated local search procedure, which includes two efficient local search operators, can effectively enhance the intensification ability of AMMA due to their complementary features. Extensive computational experiments on 126 challenging instances demonstrate the superiority of AMMA, outperforming 23 best-known solutions from existing literature while achieving similar solutions for the remaining 103 instances. Wilcoxon's signed rank test confirms that the performance of AMMA is significantly better than the state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The present study implemented the combinatorial method of FT-NIR spectroscopy with chemometrics to identify geographical origin of Khao Dawk Mali 105 rice. Rice samples were collected from 2 different region including the north and northeast of Thailand. NIR spectra data were collected in range of 12,500 – 4,000 cm−1 (800–2,500 nm). Five machine learning algorithms including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), C-support vector classification (C-SVC), backpropagation neural networks (BPNN), hybrid principal component analysis-neural network (PC-NN) and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) were employed to classify NIR data of rice samples with full wavelength and selected wavelength by Extremely Randomized Trees (Extra trees) algorithm. Based on the findings, geographical origin of rice could be specified quickly, cheaply, and reliably using combination of NIRS and machine learning. All models creating by full wavelength and selected wavelength exhibited accuracy between 65 and 100 % for identifying geographical region of rice.

Addition is the first one taught in school and is most popular in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Division, typically taught last is least studied with fMRI. fMRI meta-analyses show that arithmetic operations activate brain areas in parietal, cingulate and insular cortices for children and adults. Critically, no meta-analysis examines concordance across brain correlates of separate arithmetic operations in children and adults. We review and examine using quantitative meta-analyses data from fMRI articles that report brain coordinates separately for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in children and adults. Results show that arithmetic operations elicit common areas of concordance in fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular networks in adults and children. Between operations differences are observed primarily for adults. Interestingly, higher within-group concordance, expressed in activation likelihood estimates, is found in brain areas associated with the cingulo-opercular network rather than the fronto-parietal network in children, areas also common between adults and children.

He passed his PhD examinations in mathematics, physics and philosophy, and in January 1921 he became a doctor. A year later, he published the results of his doctorate in Fundamenta Mathematicae. Among them there was the theorem known today as the Banach Fixed Point Theorem or the Banach Contraction Principle. It is one of the most famous theorems in mathematics, one of many under the name of Banach. It concerns certain mappings (called contractions) of a complete metric space into itself and it gives the conditions sufficient for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point of such mapping. In 2022 we had a centenary of publishing this theorem. In the paper, we want to present its most important modifications and generalizations, several contractive conditions, the converse theorems and some applications.

In the event of a failure in production, a decision-making process can be time-consuming for the human and prevent timely actions. The agility can be boosted with a decision-support system based on artificial intelligence. Particularly, multi-objective process optimization can be employed to select the optimal control settings in real-time, and thus enhance relevant key performance indicators, concurrently. However, process optimization in manufacturing scenarios has never been an easy task, due to the complexity, non-convexity, and non-linearity of dependences among process parameters and physical constraints typical for strict production procedures. Precise and high-performative digital replicas of physical systems are required to simulate different scenarios. Physical models are computationally demanding for real-time applications and are usually hard to develop. In that light, this paper brings a novel solution based on multi-objective evolutionary optimization coupled with process surrogate data-driven models, in charge of predicting the relevant process responses. Based on process and quality parameters being streamed from the production plant in real-time, the optimizer can act in timely critical and quality-threatening situations and generate immediate corrective actions. The multi-regime operation of the plant and design space dimensionality can impact the convergence rate and add to execution time. Therefore, production regimes recognition and greedy search of suffix tree-based models of the process have been engaged, aiding in a better-focused and faster space search at an early phase of the algorithm run. Beyond simply reviewing the outputs, the user can leave feedback, which is utilized by the optimizer's reinforcement learning mechanisms. The process of tire tread production has served as the playground for methodology design and implementation. Validated in this real-world scenario, the solution produced a rise from 81.83% to 90.91% in the tread quality. Thanks to its generic and modular nature, the methodology is applicable to various industrial cases, with the potential to enhance their efficiency and ensure high-quality output. © 2024 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers"

In this study, the optimization of DHS piping configuration has been explored. Traditional exhaustive search methods for network design are often impractical due to computational constraints, making Genetic Algorithm (GA) a preferred alternative for navigating the vast search space of optimization problems efficiently. However, GA, which relies on probabilistic heuristics, may not always pinpoints the most effective solutions, particularly those in close proximity to the current near-optimal configuration. To address this issue, an enhanced GA-based neighboring search method for identifying optimal or near-optimal piping layout for DHS more effectively has been developed in this study. When a local minimum is detected in the GA optimization process, the method initiates a neighboring search by selecting an elite candidate. The link with the highest piping cost from the elite candidate's configuration is identified. Subsequently, one of the other nodes in the configuration is connected to the nodes of the identified link to explore solutions beyond the local optimum. This new approach was firstly validated against an Optimal Communication Spanning Tree (OCST) benchmark problem, where it demonstrated superior efficacy by achieving higher success rate and quicker first-hit generation compared to conventional GA method. Specifically, this method showed a 60 % success rate with a minimum first-hit generation number of 140, outperforming the traditional GA's 40 % success rate and 263 generations. Further modification to the OCST benchmark to better simulate a real-world DHS application underscored the ability of this neighboring search method to exceed the previously established optimal configuration, uncovering a “better' solution with superior fitness value. This promising methodology was subsequently applied to the hypothetical design of a DHS piping network, illustrating its potential to enhance the planning and implementation of efficient, cost-effective district heating systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The suffix trees reverse engineering problem, which its research aims at reducing this gap, is the following. Given an ordered rooted tree T with unlabeled edges, determine whether there exists a string w such that the unlabeled-edges suffix tree of w is isomorphic to T. Previous studies on this problem consider the relaxation of having the suffix links as well as assume a binary alphabet. This paper is the first to consider the suffix tree detection problem, in which the relaxation of having suffix links as input is removed. We study suffix tree detection on two scenarios that are interesting per se. We provide a suffix tree detection algorithm for general alphabet periodic strings. Given an ordered tree T with n leaves, our detection algorithm takes O(n+|Σ|p)-time, where p is the unknown in advance length of a period that repeats at least 3 times in a string S having a suffix tree structure identical to T, if such S exists. Therefore, it is a polynomial time algorithm if p is a constant and a linear time algorithm if, in addition, the alphabet has a sub-linear size. We also show some necessary (but insufficient) conditions for binary alphabet general strings suffix tree detection. By this we take another step towards understanding suffix trees structure. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

A graph G is said to have the reciprocal eigenvalue property (property(R)) if A(G) is nonsingular, and [Formula presented] is an eigenvalue of A(G) whenever λ is an eigenvalue of A(G). Further, if λ and [Formula presented] have the same multiplicity for each eigenvalue λ, then G is said to have the strong reciprocal eigenvalue property (property (SR)). It is known that for a tree T, the following conditions are equivalent: a) T+ is isomorphic to T, b) T has property (R), c) T has property (SR) and d) T is a corona tree (it is a tree which is obtained from another tree by adding a new pendant at each vertex). Studies on the inverses, property (R) and property (SR) of bipartite graphs are available in the literature. However, their studies for the non-bipartite graphs are rarely done. In this article, we study the inverse and property (SR) for non-bipartite graphs. We first introduce an operation, which helps us to study the inverses of non-bipartite graphs. As a consequence, we supply a class of non-bipartite graphs for which the inverse graph G+ exists and G+ is isomorphic to G. It follows that each graph G in this class has property (SR). © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Discontinuity mapping was conducted utilising manual and semi-automated methods. Manual mapping was done in open-source software CloudCompare, while semi-automated mapping was done using Discontinuity Set Extractor and two CloudCompare plug-ins, qFacet Fast Marching and qFacet Kd-Tree algorithm. Significant differences were observed between the methods in terms of the number of identified discontinuity planes, sets, mean orientation values, and weighted densities associated with specific sets. Based on the mapping results, three-dimensional rockfall susceptibility maps were generated. The 3D rockfall susceptibility assessment employed a Kinematic Hazard Index (KHI) for planar, wedge, and flexural toppling failure mechanisms, which determines the percentage of discontinuity planes that meet the geometrical conditions specific to each type of failure. The findings underscore that the mapping results greatly affect the 3D rockfall susceptibility assessment, impacting the identification of potential rockfall source areas. The study emphasizes the importance of integrating manual and semi-automated mapping for reliable 3D rockfall susceptibility assessment. Additionally, this study evaluated the effect of varying the number of discontinuity orientation input data on rockfall susceptibility by comparing nine scenarios, each involving a reduction in the number of discontinuity orientation data. The results indicate that accurate discontinuity mapping is more critical than the sheer number of mapped discontinuities for reliable rockfall susceptibility assessment. Therefore, prioritizing the precise determination of discontinuity set numbers and their associated weighted densities is essential for reliable susceptibility evaluations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

However, NPV has the drawback of collapsing variations from uncertainties in future project cash flows into a fixed expected project value today. Ignoring future uncertainties and contingencies can lead managers to make incorrect up-front binary decisions, such as investing in or abandoning the project now. The real options analysis approach (ROA) instead captures variations from uncertainties as volatilities in project value and allows flexibility in investment decisions to be contingent on information as it is revealed. Managers we consulted agreed that ROA is superior to NPV in principle, but too complex to apply in practice. The advanced mathematics and restrictive assumptions required by analytical ROAs make them especially impractical for real-world projects exposed to multiple uncertainties. Furthermore, real-world projects are often multistage and involve valuing a compound option, which is an option on an underlying option, for sequential investment decisions. Extant numerical compound ROAs have been applied to such projects but suffer from various drawbacks. Amongst other issues, they combine variations from multiple uncertainties into a consolidated volatility of project value. This conceals the impact of each source of uncertainty, resulting in inaccurate project valuation and incorrect investment decisions. We present an innovative compound multiple volatility real options approach (C-MVR) to value a multistage project while accommodating separate volatilities of project value arising from multiple uncertainties for making sequential investment decisions. The resultant value is termed the compound enhanced net present value. Implementing C-MVR for a real coal mining project demonstrates how other ROAs can be seen as inaccurate simplifications that produce erroneous investment decisions. C-MVR provides a rigorous and versatile approach that can be applied to many investment decisions across various industries. © 2024 The Authors"

The satellite solar panel is considered as the host structure, which is simplified as a cantilever beam, and the OTP NES is attached to reduce its micro-vibration. Firstly, the reduced-order model of the coupled system is obtained via the Galerkin approximation, and the dimensionless governing equations are derived. Then, the micro-vibration mitigation performance of the OTP NES is evaluated, and the characteristics of the system response under different external excitations are demonstrated. The results show that the OTP NES can significantly attenuate the micro-vibration of the cantilever beam structure, when the system vibrates in the form of the strongly modulated response (SMR). Moreover, the slow flow equation of the coupled system is deduced by the complexification-averaging (CX-A) method and the bifurcation analysis is carried out. It indicates that the presence of the folding singularity and the absence of the ordinary equilibrium point are favor to the micro-vibration mitigation performance of the OTP NES. Consequently, the OTP NES is a promising solution for attenuating micro-vibration in flexible structures. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS"

Data owners host incremental real-time data in the cloud and use blockchain as a public platform for data query, usage, and certification. Malicious attackers may manipulate data through methods like data poisoning, compromising model parameters. Blockchain-based data integrity verification (auditing) schemes can effectively detect and monitor such activities. However, managing the storage demands for massive on-chain data certificates poses significant challenges. Existing compressed certificate storage strategies, such as the Merkle-Hash tree (MHT), incur significant on-chain storage costs because the auxiliary paths and the entire tree structure must be uploaded during verification, resulting in an O(n) storage overhead. Polynomial commitments offer a promising alternative by reducing storage costs to hundreds of bytes. However, current polynomial commitment methods lack effective support for incremental data updates, which are essential for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a novel polynomial commitment-based dynamic integrity verification scheme that implements cumulative commitment updates for the first time. Our scheme includes a new data block insertion and deletion strategy that maintains the original order of data blocks within polynomial commitments. Theoretical security analysis confirms the robustness of the proposed scheme, while simulation results demonstrate that it meets the efficiency requirements for blockchain-based distributed data integrity verification mechanisms. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, rigorously tested methodologies to effectively and accurately geolocate and rectify these image data over mobile and dynamic water surfaces, where temporally fixed points of reference are unlikely to exist, are limited. We present a simple to use automated workflow for georectifying individual aerial images using position and orientation data from the drone's on-board sensor (i.e. direct-georectification). The presented methodology includes correcting for camera lens distortion and viewing angle and exploits standard mathematics and camera data processing techniques. The method is used to georectify image datasets from test flights with different combinations of altitude and camera angle. Using a test site over land, directly-georectified images, as well as the same images georectified using standard photogrammetry software, are evaluated using a network of known ground control points. The novel methodology performs well with the camera at nadir (both 10 m and 25 m above ground level) and exhibits a mean spatial accuracy of ±1 m. The same accuracy is achieved when the camera angle is 30° at 10 m above ground level but decreases to ±2.9 m at 30° and 25 m. The accuracy changes because the uncertainties are a function of the altitude and angle of the camera versus the ground. Drone in-flight positioning errors can reduce the accuracy further to ±5 m with the camera at 30° and 25 m. An ensemble approach is used to map the uncertainties within the camera field-of-view to show how they change with viewing distance and drone position and orientation. The complete approach is demonstrated over an estuarine environment that includes the shoreline and open water, producing results consistent with the land-based field-tests of accuracy. Overall, the workflow presented here provides a low cost and agile solution for direct-georectification of drone-captured image data over water surfaces. This approach could be used for collecting and processing image data from drones or ship-mounted cameras to provide observations of ocean colour, sea-ice, ocean glitter, sea surface roughness, white-cap coverage, coastal water quality, and river plumes.

It enables nodes to collaborate and autonomously build ad-hoc networks modeled by tree-like destination-oriented direct acyclic graphs (DODAG). Despite its widespread usage in industry and healthcare domains, RPL is susceptible to insider attacks. Although the state-of-the-art RPL ensures that only authenticated nodes participate in DODAG, such hard security measures are still inadequate to prevent insider threats. This entails a need to integrate soft security mechanisms to support decision-making. This paper proposes iTRPL, an intelligent and behavior-based framework that incorporates trust to segregate honest and malicious nodes within a DODAG. It also leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to make autonomous decisions concerning the DODAG. The framework enables a parent node to compute the trust for its child and decide if the latter can join the DODAG. It tracks the behavior of the child node, updates the trust, computes the rewards (or penalties), and shares them with the root. The root aggregates the rewards/penalties of all nodes, computes the overall return, and decides via its ϵ-Greedy MARL module if the DODAG will be retained or modified for the future.

The flow turbulence intensity varied using a custom-designed turbulence generator with different slot-width blockage plates placed upstream to the nominal flame-stabilization zone. The high-speed recordings of the CH*/OH* chemiluminescence and particle image velocimetry are used to deduce the relation between the flame–acoustic, flame–vortex and hydrodynamic–acoustic features during the unsteady combustion. The bifurcation analysis map revealed the effect of high inlet flow turbulence on postponing the onset of instability to higher inlet flow parameters. The initial observations showed potential changes in the acoustic behaviour and dynamical state of premixed turbulent combustion with an increase in inlet flow turbulence. The spatial Rayleigh index map illustrates a significant change in the acoustic driving region at high inlet flow turbulence based on the flame stabilization, heat release zone and flame–acoustic modulation in the shear layer and recirculation zone. The velocity spectral analysis and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) spectrum suggested a correlation between the acoustic modulation and hydrodynamic instabilities, resulting in higher heat release rate oscillations. The high inlet flow turbulence modulates the vertical flapping motion of the flame front and flame roll-up in the recirculation region as evident by DMD spectrum and spatial modes. The flame–vortex dynamics during the dynamic transition events showed that the high inlet flow turbulence influenced the vortex shedding along the shear layer and recirculation zone dynamics. At low turbulence intensity, the vortex, in turn, supports the bulk flame movement through the induced velocity, which interacts with the free stream to create regions of low velocity. In contrast, the vortex in the shear layer and flame resides along the shear layer at higher turbulence. The paper concludes that at higher inlet flow turbulence, the recirculating flame reduces the hydro–acoustically modulated flow velocity fluctuations, which significantly affect the upstream flame propagation propensity. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

This research determines the number of factors through eigenvalues greater than one and frames the structure of the scale through factor loading. The value of the eigenvalue and factor loading are considered in this research to frame and develop the structure of the scale. Furthermore, the reliability of the scale was tested with Cronbach’s alpha. The results showed six factors on the scale explaining 67.39% of the variances. A total of 26 items with factor loading greater than 0.60 were determined for the scale. The structure of the scale was as three items in the first factor, two items in the second factor, five items in the third factor, four items in the fourth factor, 10 items in the fifth factor, and two items in the sixth factor. Furthermore, the reliability of the scale was 0.958.

Various cross-section dimensions and lengths are considered, to ensure that the columns selected undergo different levels and types (“true”, “secondary-bifurcation distortional” or “secondary-bifurcation global”) of D–G interaction. The results presented and discussed, determined by means of ABAQUS shell finite element geometrically and materially non-linear analyses, consist of elastic and elastic-plastic post-buckling equilibrium paths, failure loads and collapse modes. The steel material behaviour is deemed elastic-perfectly plastic and several yield stresses are considered, thus making it possible to cover a wide column D–G slenderness range. Particular attention is devoted to identifying the most detrimental initial geometrical imperfection shapes, in the sense that they lead to the lowest column failure loads. The numerical failure load data gathered are subsequently used to assess the merits of the available DSM-based design approaches developed to handle cold-formed steel columns undergoing D–G interaction. Since these design approaches are shown to be either inefficient and/or improvable, the above failure load data are also used to propose modifications/improvements aimed at achieving an efficient failure load prediction in the specific context of fixed-ended lipped channel columns. The success of this endeavour provides encouragement to the authors in their search for a safe, accurate and reliable DSM-based design approach capable of handling cold-formed steel columns with arbitrary cross-section shapes and/or end support conditions that fail in D–G interactive modes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Acknowledging that play-based approaches can support mathematical learning, limited research explores how imaginative play creates conditions for children's mathematical problem-solving in the kindergarten period during the transition to school. To support children's mathematical problem-solving in this period, this study drew upon the cultural-historical concept of play and motives and adapted Li and Disney's (2021) Conceptual PlayWorld in mathematics (CPW) by conducting an educational experiment. This research investigated how CPW created motivating conditions in supporting children's learning motive in mathematical problem-solving in the kindergarten period during the transition to school. Video observations of teacher-child interactions during the CPW on the mathematical concepts of informal measurement of area and partial units were analysed. This study followed the focus child William's intentions and motives, revealing that CPW created motivating conditions for a dialectical transformation between play motives and mathematical learning motives. We argued that the collective and emotionally charged CPW encouraged children's continuous exploration of the dramatised mathematics problem, thus developing mathematical learning motives. The development of mathematical learning motive also contributed to play motive to engage with the play narrative. This study enriched the empirical evidence of the CPW approach, supporting kindergarten children's mathematical problem-solving in the kindergarten period during the transition to school. © 2024 The Authors"

However, the prediction of earthquake-triggered landslides has always been a great challenge because of low accuracy and high false alarms. This work proposes a novel fuzzy deep learning (FuDL) model for near real-time earthquake-triggered landslide spatial prediction. Fuzzy learning theory is for the first time employed in earthquake-triggered landslide prediction. The FuDL has high generalization and robustness, effectively improving the accuracy of earthquake-triggered landslide prediction. Eighteen earthquake-triggered landslide inventories worldwide from 2008 to 2022 are employed to conduct ETL prediction. According to the chronological order, 15 earthquake-triggered landslides from 2008 to 2018 are adopted to train the FuDL model, and 3 earthquake-triggered landslides from 2019 to 2022 are utilized for near real-time earthquake-triggered landslide prediction. Furthermore, this work reveals that ground movement, relatively steep and high topography, and strong seismic intensity are critical factors affecting the spatial distribution of earthquake-triggered landslides. In addition, this work conducted a detailed analysis of the distribution patterns of earthquake-triggered landslides on a global scale. © 2024"

However, the effective combinations of policy efforts and regional factors that shape superior local NEV innovation remain unclear. This study proposes a comprehensive framework that integrates policy instruments and region-specific factors to examine their configurational effects using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. Data analysis spanning 85 NEV pilot cities of China revealed three paths to high urban NEV innovation: one combining policy instruments and region-specific factors and two primarily driven by policy instruments. Further analysis revealed that large NEV pilot cities, with supportive institutional environments and high innovation capabilities, benefit significantly from expectation-setting instruments during their initial development stage. In contrast, smaller high-performing cities rely more on market-creation instruments during the rapid development phase. Additionally, cities within the same cluster, particularly large and capital cities, prefer similar policy instrument configurations. These findings not only illuminate strategies for local governments in designing context-specific policy instrument mixes but also suggest that the identified pathways can be adapted to other regions with comparable urban characteristics. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, sudden environmental variability makes this process erroneous and unreliable. To address this challenge, we propose a novel unsupervised learning method based on double data clustering. The central core of this method is to perform a data segmentation/clustering process in two levels by using a new clustering technique called local density peak clustering under minimum spanning tree (LDPC-MST). The main goal is to extract the most relevant information insensitive to environmental variations. In the first level of the double clustering algorithm, the LDPC-MST divides all available data points into main clusters. Subsequently, this approach is implemented to find subclusters within each main cluster and attempt to select one of them as the representative set, which contains the most relevant features. Using the representative subclusters of all main clusters, a damage detection indicator based on the Mahalanobis-squared distance is defined to detect any abnormal change caused by damage. The main innovation of this research is to develop a novel locally unsupervised learning method by using the process of double clustering and LDPC-MST. To validate this method, the natural frequencies of a concrete box-girder bridge and a steel arch bridge under strong environmental variations are incorporated. Several comparative analyses are also performed to indicate the superiority of this method over some well-known techniques. Results show that the proposed method can effectively warn the occurrence of damage with smaller rates of false positive, false negative, and total errors in comparison with state-of-The-Art techniques. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Therefore, it is crucial to accurately assess the seismic performance of these tunnels. This study first establishes a numerical model for tunnel seismic response analysis, considering soil liquefaction, segment nonlinearity, and joint deformation. The validity of the model is affirmed through experimental, theoretical, and additional numerical simulations. The probabilistic seismic demand models are established employing the seismic database consisting of 120 ground motion records. Subsequently, a quantitative selection method for the optimal Intensity Measure (IM) based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is proposed, identifying Velocity Spectrum Intensity (VSI) as the most suitable among 29 commonly used IMs, and the IMs related to duration exhibit poor performance. The study then categorizes tunnel damage into three states: minor, moderate, and extensive, using joint opening as the damage measure. Finally, seismic fragility analysis is employed to assess seismic performance of tunnel, and fragility curves derived using VSI and Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) is compared. The results indicate that PGA, a commonly used IM, significantly underestimates the probability of damage to the tunnel, with a maximum underestimation of 22.4%. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

This research, with the aim of describing efforts to establish independence and creativity in learning mathematics by elementary school teachers in West Kalimantan, uses a qualitative descriptive method with a questionnaire as a research instrument. The results of the study show that: i) the formation of self-regulated learning by the teacher is very good, especially in the indicators of disciplined behavior. However, it needs to be improved on indicators of behaving based on one's own initiative; and ii) the formation of learning creativity by the teacher is very good, especially on the indicator of having a great curiosity.

However, existing literature predominantly focuses on sustainability alone, leaving a research gap in understanding the complex relationship among sustainability, resilience, and responsiveness within biofuel production systems. This study aims to bridge this gap by proposing a novel approach that integrates sustainability, resilience, and responsiveness within the (lean, agile, responsive, green) LARG framework through the development of a decision-making system. To mitigate operational uncertainty in decision-making, the study employs neutrosophic fuzzy optimization (NFO), support vector regression (SVR) for biomass supply prediction, and geographic information systems (GIS) for potential biorefinery site identification. The proposed model and solution approach undergo validation in a real case study, accompanied by sensitivity analyses. Key findings reveal a substantial influence of the decision maker's risk attitude on strategic decisions in the biofuel production system, with risk-averse approaches resulting in lower objective attainment levels. Additionally, strategic decisions concerning biorefinery locations emerge as critical factors in the biofuel production and distribution system, significantly affecting both upstream and downstream operations and the attainment levels of sustainability, resilience, and responsiveness dimensions. Furthermore, the study observes that introducing redundancy to the biodiesel production network without adequate planning may not necessarily enhance resilience. However, reinforcing critical nodes with redundancy proves to be a significant factor in improving overall network resilience, hence withstanding disruptive events. Biofuel producers, along with policymakers, regulatory bodies, and related stakeholders, stand to potentially benefit from this research. © 2023"

However, traditional log systems are susceptible to tampering, posing a significant security risk to information systems. Although blockchain technology has been introduced to enhance tamper resistance, existing blockchain-based log systems still suffer from storage and query efficiency issues. In this paper, we propose a novel secure and efficient log storage and query framework that combines on-chain and off-chain collaboration. An inverted index table is constructed by extracting keywords from logs, which are stored on the blockchain as on-chain data, while the logs themselves are maintained as off-chain data. This approach facilitates the rapid retrieval of specific keywords and ensures the immutability of the logs. Furthermore, we propose a secure and efficient log query method featuring a smart contract designed to automatically handle requests from legitimate log queriers. We also design a data structure based on merkle adaptive radix tree (MART) and merkle B+ tree (MBT) to store index entries, thereby achieving efficient log retrieval. We provide formal security proofs and comprehensively evaluate the proposed framework's performance experimentally. Results demonstrate that MBT and MART reduce average query times by 20.09% and 51% respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art schemes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Utilizing the traveling wave transformations, we are able to convert the nonlinear partial differential equations (NLPDES) into ordinary differential equations (NLODEs). In this study, an analytical technique is used to utilize the exact soliton solutions of this proposed model. This efficient method is known as the modified auxiliary equation method. This extraction of soliton solutions contains various types of solutions such as trigonometric, hyperbolic, and rational solutions. For a graphical representation, we utilize Mathematica and Maple software to depict the solutions in 3D, 2D, contour plots, and density plots. The main novelty of this paper is to explore the qualitative study, which includes the chaotic behavior, bifurcation, sensitivity, and stability analysis of this problem. For this, first, we apply the Galilean transformation, we convert the NLODEs into two systems of equations. Moreover, the qualitative dynamics of the time-varying dynamical system are examined by employing chaos theory. We explore the intricacies of 3D and 2D phase portraits, time series, and Poincaré maps as powerful tools for detecting the elusive nature of chaos in self-governing dynamic systems. Sensitivity and stability analysis is also studied by using the various initial conditions, revealing the remarkable stability of the system under investigation. The system's stability is confirmed by the fact that even small changes to the initial conditions have no appreciable effect on the solutions. The results of this study are novel and valuable for further investigation of equations which are helpful for the incoming researchers. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Firstly, a composite determination method was designed based on prediction and parameter identification to divide the operating condition types, which could be as an operating condition prediction and feed forward control method to determine the approximate optimal power distribution between APU and battery. This method keeps APU operating at the optimal operating point/area as much as possible without predicting the accurate vehicle speed sequence. Then, an adaptive method based on V2X information was used to adjust the key threshold parameters in real-time using a fuzzy logic controller which reduces the algorithm complexity with prediction and division of the operating conditions types, which has significantly improved the robustness and overall performance of the optimization.

The framework utilizes sparse random neighborhood trees and a velocity command generator based on partial feedback linearization. Compared to existing approaches, the methodology introduces a sequential composition of elliptical regions and associated nonlinear feedback control algorithms (funnels) to enhance sparsity and computational efficiency. The approach comprises two primary stages: neighborhood tree generation and feedback motion control. In the tree generation stage, a sparse, collision-free, connected tree structure is constructed within the environment using elliptical regions (funnels). Subsequently, each funnel is assigned a dedicated control policy to ensure safe vehicle operation and guide it toward its goal position. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, comprehensive experiments were conducted involving both simulation studies and physical implementations on an autonomous surface vehicle platform. A significant contribution of this work is the development and hardware validation of a partial feedback linearization-based controller, which ensures robust navigation of the vehicle within elliptical regions. The proposed trajectory-free, sampling-based feedback motion planning scheme is compatible with 2D polygonal map representations, enabling practical deployment in real-world environments for USVs. Moreover, the use of elliptical funnels enhances tree sparsity compared to circular funnels, thereby improving computational efficiency, reducing mode changes, and decreasing the total operation duration. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Its development is well understood at the onset of supercritical bifurcation, but not beyond, or in the case of subcritical bifurcation. This is mainly due to nonlinearities and the extreme imperfection sensitivity. In both types of bifurcations, the energy–displacement diagrams that can characterize an energy landscape are non-convex, which is notoriously difficult to determine numerically or experimentally, let alone analytically. To gain an elementary understanding of such potential energy landscapes, we take a thin beam theory suitable for analyzing large displacements under small strains and significantly reduce its complexity by reformulating it in terms of the tangent rotation angle. This enables a comprehensive analytical and numerical analysis of wrinkling elastic films on planar substrates, which are effective stiffening and/or softening due to either geometric or material nonlinearities. We also validate our findings experimentally. We explicitly show how effective stiffening nonlinear behavior (e.g., due to substrate or membrane deformations) leads to a supercritical post-bifurcation response, makes the energy landscape non-convex through energy barriers causing multistability, which is extremely problematic for numerical computation. Moreover, this type of nonlinearity promotes uni-modal, uniformly distributed, periodic deformation patterns. In contrast, nonlinear effective softening behavior leads to subcritical post-bifurcation behavior, similarly divides the energy landscape by energy barriers and conversely promotes localization of deformations. With our theoretical model we can thus explain an experimentally observed phenomenon that in structures with effective softening followed by an effective stiffening behavior, the symmetry is initially broken by localizing the deformation and later restored by forming periodic, distributed deformation patterns as the load is increased. Finally, we show that initial imperfections can significantly alter the local or global energy-minimizing deformation pattern and completely remove some energy barriers. We envision that this knowledge can be extrapolated and exploited to convexify extremely divergent energy landscapes of more sophisticated systems, such as wrinkling compressed films on curved substrates (e.g., on cylinders and spheres) and that it will enable elementary analysis and the development of specialized numerical tools. © 2024 The Author(s)"

To address these problems, a novel inference algorithm using a mutual information-based fuzzy genetic programming approach (MIFuGP) is proposed to infer large-scale Boolean networks accurately. To represent complex regulatory relationships in Boolean networks, MIFuGP encodes Boolean functions as syntax tree programs. Taking the dependency between genes into account, MIFuGP fully extracts the mutual information from the syntax trees to alleviate the bloat problem. MIFuGP also provides a novel fitness function to make full use of state-transitions and topology information, together with a fuzzy logic control strategy to reduce the overfitting problem.

This paper presents a novel approach to address these challenges through an optimized virtual machine (VM) migration strategy that employs a game-theoretic approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) (PSO-GTA). The proposed approach leverages the collaborative and competitive dynamics of Game Theory to minimize energy consumption while using renewable energy. In this context, the game is represented by the swarm, where each player, embodied by particles, carries both competitive and cooperative elements essential to shape the collective behavior of the swarm. PSO is integrated to refine migration decisions, improving global convergence and optimizing the allocation of VMs to hosts. Through extensive simulations and performance evaluations, the proposed approach demonstrates significant improvements in resource utilization and energy efficiency, promoting sustainability in cloud computing environments. This research contributes to the development of environmentally friendly cloud computing systems, thus ensuring the delivery of energy-efficient cloud computing. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms fuzzy and genetic methods in terms of renewable energy usage.

In this paper, we propose a mixture modelling approach to model selection in chain event graphs that does not rely on conjugacy. Moreover, we show that this methodology is more amenable to being robustly scaled than the existing model selection algorithms used for this family. We demonstrate our techniques on simulated datasets. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Maintaining constant bottom-hole pressure during drilling operations is crucial for ensuring well-bore stability, preventing kicks and blowouts, optimizing drilling performance, minimizing formation damage, and improving data acquisition accuracy. To achieve dependable performance, nonlinear controllers often consider the accurate model of the system. This research encompasses three contributions. First, by implementing an sliding mode controller and the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model, the proposed control strategy evaluates the stability of constant BHP drilling while incorporating external disturbances and uncertainties and employing a robust disturbance rejection technique that accounts for both transient and steady states. Second, estimating the imprecise system parameters is achieved through the adaptive control methodology. Third, a novel type of sliding manifold has been developed for use in the fuzzy sliding mode control technique. In the end, the simulation results and conclusions indicate that if the initial conditions of the drilling process are within the acceptable range of pore and fracture gradients, the bottom-hole pressure will reach a suitable reference value without exceeding the pressure window. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

This study aimed to assess the impact of the STEM-based digital disaster learning model on the disaster adaptation abilities of elementary school students. This research is a quasi-experimental. The data collection instrument is the disaster adaptation ability essay test questions. The data analysis process uses the help of the SPSS 26 application. The findings found an average difference in students’ disaster adaptation abilities between STEM-based digital learning models and conventional learning models. This finding was also reinforced by the post-test average scores of students who studied using STEM-based digital disaster learning models, which were higher than those with conventional learning models. So overall, the STEM-based digital disaster learning model increases elementary school students’ disaster adaptation abilities. The implications of this research can be used as a reference in developing elementary school students’ disaster adaptation abilities. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

This 2-year longitudinal study (N = 790 Grade 6, 8, and 10 students during Year 1; 50.7% girls and 49.3% boys) investigated (a) the extent to which the endorsement of positively and negatively biased racial stereotypes predicted Black adolescents' math performance through their cognitive engagement and ability mindset and (b) whether gender and ethnic-racial identity moderated these links. Results suggested that endorsement of negatively biased stereotypes was associated with diminished cognitive engagement and lower math scores across 2 years (p < .05). Additionally, adolescents' ethnic-racial identity commitment moderated the negative links between stereotype endorsement and math cognitive engagement in Year 2 (p < .05). When considering the mediating role of math ability mindsets, the endorsement of both positively and negatively biased racial stereotypes operated on math performance via its links to stronger fixed ability mindset beliefs in both years (p < .05). Gender also moderated the effects of racial stereotype endorsement on math mindset beliefs in Year 1 (p < .01). This study's findings advance the field's understanding of the psychosocial mechanisms through which racial stereotypes operate, thus enabling educators to develop tailored practices that facilitate equitable access to math learning opportunities. © 2024 Society for the Study of School Psychology"

This behavior potentially impedes the retinal and cortical responses essential for visual restoration. Consequently, understanding the dynamics of AII amacrine cell firing is critical. We expanded the study by incorporating a calcium ion channel into the original model, creating a refined eight-dimensional AII model. This enhancement allowed us to conduct an in-depth exploration of system behavior via bifurcation analysis and an extensive examination of multi-timescale singularities. We identified the parameter ranges that control the firing activities of the model through codimension-one and codimension-two bifurcation analyses of key parameters. Furthermore, our research revealed that introducing a balance equation determines a transition from regular spiking to bursting. Importantly, the orchestration of three-timescale spiking and bursting attractors is enabled by the universal unfolding of the winged cusp singularity. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of firing dynamics in a high-dimensional neuron model. The insights derived significantly advance our understanding the dynamical behaviors of AII amacrine cells and are promising for improving strategies for retinal pathologies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

We have accurately derived the static expression of these thin beams, obtained the stiffness characteristic and innovatively analyzed the vibration transmission characteristics of the ring isolator by deriving its dispersion equation. The influences of damping, frequency ratio, mass ratio, stiffness ratio, linear stiffness and nonlinear stiffness on the wave vector were obtained using the dispersion equation.

Although correlational in nature, these studies suggest that number sense training emphasizing integrating across notations may have more positive outcomes than a within-notation focus. However, this idea has not been empirically tested. Thus, across two studies with undergraduate students (N = 183 and N = 181), we investigated the effects of a number line training program using a cross-notation approach (one that focused on connections among fractions, decimals, and percentages) and a within-notation approach (one that focused on fraction magnitude representation only). Both number line approaches produced positive effects, but those of the cross-notation approach were larger for fraction magnitude estimation and cross-notation comparison accuracy. In a third study (N = 63), we adapted the cross-notation number line training for use in place of typical classroom warm-up activities for middle school students. Similar to the results with undergraduate students, the cross-notation training program yielded positive benefits for middle school students over a typical warm-up activity (fraction arithmetic practice). Together, these results suggest the importance of an integrated approach to teaching rational number notations, an approach that appears to be uncommon in current curricula. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

These properties render them highly relevant for multiphysics applications. The influence of a photo-induced thermal environment on the behavior of these plates is also examined. A notable challenge, the inherent stiffness of these structures, is addressed by integrating a nanocomposite laminated core composed of a polymer matrix and graphene platelet (GPL) reinforcers. The GPLs are distributed throughout the core layers according to functionally graded models, significantly enhancing structural integrity. To effectively model the core environment, the Halpin-Tsai micromechanical rule is employed. The structural displacement field is modeled using the first-order shear deformation theory. Moreover, the von-Kármán geometrically nonlinear strain-displacement relations are applied. The constitutive relationships are governed by the theory of linear photo-thermo-electro-elasticity, providing a framework for the analysis of perovskite-based structures. The reorganization of bifurcation points from the pre-buckling route and the linearization of stability equations are performed using the adjacent-equilibrium criterion. The generalized differential quadrature (GDQ) method is utilized to solve the equilibrium equations of pre-buckling and the stability equations of buckling.

In this study, experimental tests with methane and 50% oxygen-enriched air are conducted to investigate the relationship between upstream pressure characteristics and the detonation wave. As a result of operational considerations, a hollow chamber and a rear ignitor are used and the initiation process is discussed. Upstream pressure characteristics are analyzed under varied injection pressures and equivalence ratios. Stable modes including single-wave and double-wave modes are recorded in most cases. Notably, two unstable modes are also captured at low injection pressure in which the detonation quenches quickly. The results highlight that significant feedback pressure pulsations synchronize with the rotation frequency of detonation waves after ignition due to the upstream oblique shock wave (UOSW). But the inherent frequency of injection should also be emphasized at elevated injection pressure. The detonation wave can also cause injection blockage, particularly at low injection pressure, leading to the bifurcation of unstable mode. Such unstable is attributed to an inadequate upstream pressure increase after ignition, which hinders the injection reconstruction. Further analysis reveals that higher injection pressures or lower equivalence ratios diminish the differential between the detonation wave and upstream pressure, and consequently, the pulsation amplitude. An increase in the detonation wave number can also reduce the pulsation amplitude, which can even be lower than 10% in a double-wave mode. The results are beneficial for integrating RDE and its upstream components. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS"

Following a recent study by Bramburger and Holzer (SIAM J Math Anal 55(3):2150–2185, 2023), we consider discrete SHE on deterministic and random graphs. The two families of the discrete models share the same continuum limit in the form of a nonlocal SHE on a circle. The analysis of the continuous system, parallel to the analysis of the classical SHE, shows bifurcations of spatially periodic solutions at critical values of the control parameters. However, the proximity of the discrete models to the continuum limit does not guarantee that the same bifurcations take place in the discrete setting in general, because some of the symmetries of the continuous model do not survive discretization. We use the center manifold reduction and normal forms to obtain precise information about the number and stability of solutions bifurcating from the homogeneous state in the discrete models on deterministic and sparse random graphs.

This study proposes an elastic force contraction algorithm (EFCA) and a minimum set method (MSM) to reduce operational costs and congestion in the waterway network. The EFCA rapidly plans a path for UCSs from an origin point to a destination, ensuring swift passage through the waterway. The MSM removes redundant nodes in the initial path planned by the EFCA, shortening the path length and thereby reducing operational costs. Finally, a UCS kinematic mathematical model is utilized for trajectory planning based on the path planned by the application of EFCA and MSM. Simulation experiments show that the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm is 70.2% and 96.6% higher than that of the bidirectional rapidly exploring random trees (BIRRT) and state prediction rapidly exploring random trees (spRRT) algorithms, respectively.

The research sample was selected using convenience sampling. Data were collected from 226 pre-service teachers in the Bachelor of Education Elementary Specialty (BEES) using a 28-item questionnaire. The validity of the items was tested by factor analysis using the extraction method of principal component analysis with varimax rotation. Reliability tests for the different constructs were conducted by calculating Cronbach’s alpha. Frequency, mean, standard deviation and Mann-Whitney tests were used to analyze the data. The results revealed that pre-service elementary teachers have generally neutral attitudes toward integrated STEM education, and they also showed that pre-service teachers’ attitudes toward integrated STEM education do not depend on gender or grade level. However, these attitudes are dependent on pre-university studies. Pre-service teachers with a scientific background have significantly more positive attitudes toward integrated STEM education than their counterparts with a literary background. Furthermore, the results of this study also revealed that pre-service teachers have positive attitudes toward the use of mobile devices in integrated STEM education, and these attitudes are not dependent on gender, grade level, or pre-university studies. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Lasers are by nature particularly well suited to automation, but to ensure repeatability and reliability, the engineers employing them must not simply rely on numerical analysis software. They must have a firm grasp on the physical principles involved. Mathematics of Thermal Modelling: An Introduction to the Theory of Laser Material Processing introduces the mathematics needed to formulate and exploit the physical principles important to modelling various aspects of laser material processing. The author shows how to gain insight by constructing and analyzing simple models. He demonstrates how to extract qualitative information from the models, how the underlying principles can be extended to more complex modelling, and how these principles can be applied to processes such as laser welding, surface treatment, drilling, and cutting. Written at a level accessible to graduate students, this book shows that simple mathematical investigation-- based primarily on analytical methods backed by relatively simple numerical methods--can greatly illuminate the processes being studied. Regardless of the stage of your career development, if you are confronting the modelling of thermal process in this field for the first time, Mathematics of Thermal Modelling will build the foundation you need. © 2025 John Michael Dowden.

These optimization problems have found diverse applications in various sciences including electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and aerospace. Current methods for solving this class of optimal control problems usually fall into two classes: discrete-then-optimization or optimization-then-discrete approaches. The proposed approach, however, does not require discretization as it involves rewriting the optimal control problem as a multi-objective optimization problem followed by its solution with a feedforward single-layer artificial neural network based on learning through by the multi-level Levenberg–Marquardt method.

Accordingly, a more reliable design of water-front geotechnical structures requires the consideration of uncertain spatial changes in the soil. In this research, the stability of anchored sheet pile walls is investigated under the influence of uncertainties in soil and structure using a novel fuzzy logic-based approach. The spatial variability is considered by layering the soil according to different profiles representing variations in soil parameters. The genetic algorithm is used to calculate the fuzzy safety factors of overturning, sliding, and flexural failure modes at different uncertainty levels. By computing the probability of failure and the reliability index, a comparison is made between the results of all profiles. Several graphs are provided to assist geotechnical engineers in the more robust and economical design of sheet pile walls. The results indicate that accounting for the uncertainties and variability of the soil parameters is of crucial importance for the stability analysis. Finally, it is found that the developed technique, considering the profiles reflecting a more realistic distribution of the soil parameters and their uncertainties, could result in a greater reliability of the system. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The bubble split and collide behavior in multistage divergent-convergent branching structures were observed and studied. It was demonstrated that the bubble breakup at bifurcations relies dramatically on the collision behavior of the bubble pairs at the downstream convergence. Four bubble flow regimes were observed at the convergence: no collision, collision-slipping, squeezing-slipping, and blockage-slipping. The non-uniformity of the fluid distribution mainly stems from uneven breakup of bubbles at the upstream bifurcation, the lack of bubble breakup, the feedback effects of downstream and the manufacturing errors. Furthermore, the variation of pressure drop in a honeycomb microreactor was explored. The overall pressure drop was found to increase by the local pressure drop, whereas reduced with the increased absorption capacity of liquid phase. Taking these impact factors into account, a modified Lockhart-Martinelli pressure drop model was developed. © 2024"

The nonlinear static behavior and stability of the pendulum have been characterized by analyzing the fixed points. It is found that Pitchfork bifurcation governs the relationship between the rod density (the control parameter) and the static equilibrium angle. The pendulum's nonlinear response to external harmonic torque is obtained using harmonic balance method (HBM). The influence of system parameters, including hinge height, rod diameter, and rod density, on the nonlinear frequency response is examined.

First, by utilizing user-friendly version of Crandall–Rabinowitz bifurcation theory as an analytical method, the spatio-temporal patterns of positive steady state are obtained. Then, by regarding the cross-diffusion coefficient d1 as a bifurcation parameter, we will derive a bifurcation theorem for the corresponding nonlinear cross-diffusion model. Moreover, by applying spectrum theory, perturbation of simple eigenvalues and linearized stability, it is discovered that the bifurcation solutions possess local stability near the bifurcating point in proper conditions. These theoretical results mean that the cross-diffusion mechanism can create a coexistence environment for the preys and predator under some circumstances.

Although such a pursuit is inherently challenging, a recent method used in publications (the “Age-Sex Identification Matrix'' approach) relies on flawed assumptions that produce unacceptably inaccurate results. Among other issues, basic mathematics, the literature cited as ostensibly supporting this method, and even the authors’ own published data contradict fundamental assumptions underlying their approach. The two types of fingerprint measurements used in the Age-Sex Identification Matrix approach as proxies for age and sex respectively—mean ridge breadth (distance per ridge) and ridge density (ridges per distance)—are reciprocal values that are not independent. Additionally, in opposition to the methodological thesis of this approach, the previous studies cited in support of this method demonstrate, on the contrary, that both age and sex vary with both mean ridge breadth and ridge density. The published data used in this method also highlight the non-independent nature of the two measures. We caution other researchers to disregard the results of these studies until the data are re-analyzed with a more accurate methodology. Finally, we offer a methodology from the field of Bayesian statistics as an alternative that is able to disentangle the effects of age and sex on fingerprint ridge measurements. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Leadership is formed systematically from an early age until the end of human life, one of which is by actively participating in a sports club. A club can develop because of the roles in sports, both by athletes, coaches, managers, and others. To win a competition or race, it is necessary to collaborate between athletes in an extraordinary manner in order to achieve the highest goal, namely victory. Many plans are developed, implemented and evaluated. This process requires leadership from team members at every level. Ultimately, this process is internalized in each member, both as a member and line leader, as it takes place in a sports club. How this leadership is formed is shown in this article. Data bases were searched using search engines on Scopus or Science Direct and others before analysis using PRISMA. The final selection of the research database was carried out by checking for duplication, analyzing the title, completeness of the abstract manuscript, and the title and content of the article, resulting in 38 articles. The results showed that active participation in sports, especially those that embrace shared leadership, provides the experience to become one goal and vision of a common mission, so that each member is more motivated to collaborate and spend time, energy, and even money to achieve this goal. This process requires unipersonal skills. In addition, authoritarian and native leadership models are still used. Obviously, whatever leadership model is applied will provide soft skills to participants, no matter what they want. This will lead to leadership in other fields besides sports, including in mathematics education. According to the literature evidence, there are twelve studies that transform sports involvement into life-beneficial values; eight studies that influence leadership behavior towards running sports organizations; four studies on transformational leadership. When people participate in active leadership activities and take on roles, they gain useful experiences, which in turn will have a positive impact on their leadership development in life. © 2024 Federacion Espanola de Docentes de Educacion Fisica.

However, it is still a challenge to design the stable auxiliary support structure of SLA production with less material but successful printing. Although most of the research and current commercial software have designed a tree-like support topology based on geometric algorithms, there is a lack of global evolutionary ideas for support structure optimization. Herein, a new kind of SLA hierarchical clustering evolutionary tree support (HCETS) is proposed through an efficient and economical solution. This HCETS combines the principles of hierarchical clustering and parallel configuration to adapt two different types of support points. It uses an improved multi-objective decomposition algorithm specifically for tree support, and uses KD-tree acceleration method in the process of special inclined support structure to reduce the algorithm load. In addition, HCETS adopts intra-group selection strategy (IGSS) and environment selection strategy (ESS) to alleviate the selection pressure and diversity loss caused by population expansion. These strategies could greatly improve the convergence speed in large-scale populations through fast non-dominated sorting algorithms. The overall results show that our presented HCETS algorithm is superior to the known algorithms in terms of support creating speed and material waste for stable and low-volume tree-like support structures, which is of great significance for the further improvement of the support performance of SLA additive manufacturing. © 2024 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers"

Recent findings in cognitive neuroscience suggest that cognitive skills are facilitated by distributed, transient, and dynamic networks in the brain, rather than isolated functional modules. Further, research on the bodily and evolutionary bases of cognition reveals that our cognitive skills harness capacities originally evolved for action and that cognition is best understood in conjunction with perceptuomotor capacities. Despite these insights, neural models of numerical cognition struggle to capture the relation between mathematical skills and perceptuomotor systems. One front to addressing this issue is to identify building block sensorimotor processes (BBPs) in the brain that support numerical skills and develop a new ontology connecting the sensorimotor system with mathematical cognition. BBPs here are identified as sensorimotor functions, associated with distributed networks in the brain, and are consistently identified as supporting different cognitive abilities. BBPs can be identified with new approaches to neuroimaging; by examining an array of sensorimotor and cognitive tasks in experimental designs, employing data-driven informatics approaches to identify sensorimotor networks supporting cognitive processes, and interpreting the results considering the evolutionary and bodily foundations of mathematical abilities. New empirical insights on the BBPs can eventually lead to a revamped embodied cognitive ontology in numerical cognition. Among other mathematical skills, numerical magnitude processing and its sensorimotor origins are discussed to substantiate the arguments presented. Additionally, an fMRI study design is provided to illustrate the application of the arguments presented in empirical research. © 2024 The Author"

Conducted as an intrinsic case study, the research followed three stages: data collection, description, and analysis, to elucidate the unique narrative of classroom-based character education implementation. The research took place at SMAIT Nur Hidayah Sukoharjo from October 2022 to June 2023, involving educators from the disciplines of Chemistry, Physics, Biology, and Mathematics. Key data sources included the Principal, Vice Principal for Student Affairs, homeroom teachers, subject teachers, students, and supporting documents. Data were meticulously collected through interviews and observations, with the credibility of the data being ensured through triangulation of methods and sources. Analysis was conducted using Atlas.ti version 8 software. The findings reveal that the character education framework at SMAIT Nur Hidayah Sukoharjo is centered on core values such as cooperation, devotion to God, and integrity. Teachers play a crucial role in consistently monitoring student behavior and developing lesson plans that seamlessly integrate these character values. This integration is reflected in students' social interactions and collaborative spirit within the classroom setting. Furthermore, character evaluation is conducted holistically, considering not only academic performance but also behavior, social interactions, and psychomotor skills.

In particular, does comprehension of dual case marking support young children's understanding of cardinality? We assessed number knowledge in 77 3-year-old Arabic–English bilingual children using the Give-a-Number task in both languages. Given recent concerns around the administration and scoring of the Give-a-Number task, we used two complementary approaches: one based on conceptual levels and the other based on overall test scores. We also tested comprehension of dual case marking in Arabic and number sequence knowledge in both languages. Regression analyses showed that dual case comprehension exerts a strong influence on cardinality tested in Arabic independent of age, general language skills, and number sequence knowledge. No such influence was found for cardinality tested in English, indicating a language-specific effect. Further analyses tested for transfer of cardinality knowledge between languages. These revealed, in addition to the findings outlined above, a powerful cross-linguistic transfer effect. Our findings are consistent with a model in which the direct effect of dual case marking is language specific, but concepts, once acquired, may be represented abstractly and transferred between languages. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

The study focuses on the Maker mindsets transformation of three students with varying abilities, deliberately chosen as information-rich participants. A project-specific questionnaire, the Maker Mindsets Scale, was employed to facilitate self-assessment of Maker mindsets before and after intervention. Additionally, teachers' post-lesson discussion meetings were observed, and semi-structured interviews with participating teachers were conducted to gauge their perceptions of students' Maker mindsets transformation. The analysis encompassed students' semi-structured reflection logs and interviews to uncover the underlying factors driving Maker mindsets transformation. The results revealed distinct variations in how students of different abilities perceived their Maker mindsets transformation. Nonetheless, participant teachers consistently observed transformations in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) thinking skills, self-efficacy, motivation, and collaborative learning across all students. The study further identifies a collaborative convergence of multiple factors contributing to Maker mindsets transformation, spanning teacher, student, and pedagogical perspectives. These findings carry significant implications for educators, advocating for the implementation of customized strategies, authentic contextualization, structured methodologies, and collaborative frameworks to holistically nurture Maker mindsets evolution. Moreover, our study underscores the practicality of the LS approach in fostering collaborative development of innovative pedagogical strategies aimed at fostering Maker mindsets formation. © 2024"

And the radiation capillary terminal (RCT) operates more stable and efficiency compared with fan coil due to the low temperature heat release and fast response speed. To fully use the advantage of renewable energy and RCT, a GSHP-ASHP system integrated with a RCT was proposed in this study. A mathematical model of the system based on TRNSYS was developed and verified by experiment in Wuhan (114°12′ E, 30°12′ N), China. Classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm was adopted as operation strategy of the GHSP-ASHP-RCT system. Compared with three air conditioning systems (electric refrigeration and gas boiler system, GSHP system and ASHP system), the primary energy utilization rate (PER) of the GHSP-ASHP-RCT system was increased by 4.5 %, 1.8 % and 10.0 %, respectively. The total life cycle cost (LCC) of the GHSP-ASHP-RCT system was reduced by 8.3 %, 20.6 % and 25.5 % than the three systems, respectively.

This information is crucial to trigger early warnings in areas where the impact of tsunami waves is predicted to be dangerous (or potentially cause destruction), to help the management of the potential impact of a tsunami as well as reduce environmental destruction and losses of human lives. For such a reason, it is crucial that TEWSs produce predictions with short computation time while maintaining a high prediction accuracy. This paper presents a parallel machine learning approach, based on regression trees, to discover tsunami predictive models from simulation data. In order to achieve the results in a short time, the proposed approach relies on the parallelization of the most time consuming tasks and on incremental learning executions, in order to achieve higher performances in terms of execution time, efficiency and scalability. The experimental evaluation, performed on two real tsunami cases occurred in the Western and Eastern Mediterranean basin in 2003 and 2017, shows reasonable advantages in terms of scalability and execution time, which is an important benefit in a urgent-computing scenarios. © 2024 The Author(s)"

The initial pricing model is transformed into a linear complementarity problem (LCP) in a bounded rectangular domain, achieved through the application of a priori estimations and the introduction of an appropriate artificial boundary condition. To discretize the LCP, we employ a finite difference method (FDM), and address the resulting discretized system using a primal-dual active set (PDAS) strategy. The PDAS approach is particularly advantageous for its ability to concurrently determine the option’s price and the optimal exercise boundary. This paper conducts an extensive convergence analysis, evaluating both the truncation error associated with the FDM and the iteration error of the PDAS.

However, a lack of information on mathematical development and spatial–mathematical associations in people with Down syndrome (DS) hinders the translation of these interventions. Here, we established developmental trajectories of mathematics and explored whether spatial ability predicts attainment on different mathematics measures in individuals with DS. Participants with DS (n = 36; ages 9–35 years) and TD children (n = 132; ages 4–11 years) completed three groups of tasks: spatial tasks assessing different subdomains of spatial thinking; mathematics tasks assessing early mathematics skills, mathematical reasoning, arithmetic, and geometry; and IQ tasks. The developmental trajectories of mathematics performance against mental age revealed similar starting points of the trajectories and similar rates of development for DS and TD groups. Furthermore, after controlling for verbal skills, spatial skills explained 5.8% to 18.1% of the variation in mathematical performance across different mathematics tasks, and the pattern of spatial–mathematical relations was similar for DS and mental age-matched TD groups. This shows that mathematical development in DS groups appears to mirror that in TD children, indicative of delay only. Strong spatial–mathematical relations were observed for individuals with DS, like those seen for TD participants. This is the vital preliminary knowledge needed to support the design and use of spatial intervention for improving mathematics in individuals with DS. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Our mixed-methods research takes a different approach and considers the relationship between student motivation and instructional practices. Teaching practices and student motivation were analyzed simultaneously in undergraduate Biology classes using a self-determination theory-based survey to measure students' motivation during courses that were observed using the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (COPUS), and observation notes were collected to document instructor and student behaviors. Quantitative data were used to differentiate students' motivational levels, and qualitative data were collected to describe how instructors use specific teaching practices. The results provide a lens into how students' intrinsic motivation varies alongside the instructional practices and interactions in these classes. We found a correlation between higher levels of student motivation in interactive lectures and student-centered teaching profiles. This study highlights how the same practice can be implemented by multiple instructors with varying student motivation scores, pointing out the importance of fidelity to evidence-based instructional practice methods. The results of this study are discussed in the context of published empirical studies examining evidence-based instructional practices that are conceptually supportive of autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

Hence the ability to detect non-termination programs before software deployment is crucial. Existing detection methods are either execution-based or deep learning-based. Despite great advances, their limitations are evident. The former requires complex sandbox environments for execution, while the latter lacks fine-grained analysis. Objective: To overcome the above limitations, this paper proposes a graph-enhanced contrastive approach, namely TerGEC, which combines both inter-class and intra-class semantics to carry out a more fine-grained analysis and exempt execution during the detection process. Methods: In detail, TerGEC analyzes behaviors of programs from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), thereby capturing intra-class semantics both syntactically and lexically. Besides, it incorporates contrastive learning to learn the discrepancy between program behaviors of termination and non-termination, thereby acquiring inter-class semantics. In addition, graph augmentation is designed to improve the robustness. Weighted contrastive loss and focal loss are also equipped in TerGEC to alleviate the classes-imbalance problem during the non-termination detection. Consequently, the whole detection process can be handled more fine-grained, and the execution can also be exempted due to the nature of deep learning. Results: We evaluate TerGEC on five datasets of both Python and C languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate TerGEC achieves the best performance overall. Among all experimented datasets, TerGEC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 8.20% in terms of mAP and by 17.07% in terms of AUC on average. Conclusion: TerGEC is capable of detecting non-terminating programs with high precision, showing that the combination of inter-class and intra-class learning, along with our proposed classes-imbalance solutions, is significantly effective in practice. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Firstly, we prove the existence, the uniqueness and asymptotic behaviors of positive solution of the single population system by using the degree theory. Secondly, by the degree theory and standard bifurcation theory, the existence and global structure of the coexistence solutions are investigated. The results show that when the maximum growth rates of two microorganisms with different diffusion abilities are not small, two competing microorganisms will coexist.

This is related to the low enrolment rate of STEM-based courses at Universities. The notion that STEM subjects are intense and difficult to pass could be the reason of such phenomena. This research experimented different lecture delivery methods comprising of different seating arrangements, inclusion or exclusion of break, group size, and room size to investigate the generated levels of stress among STEM students, so that the method that would induce minimum stress could be discovered. The analysis of the generated heart rates as stress indication concludes that the level of difficulty of STEM subject’s topic is the one that most affected students’ level of stress, while inclusion of break during class is imperious to destress students. Class arrangement with far seating was discovered to be potentially more stressful for certain students indicated by the high level of resting heart rate in one of the experiments. Importantly, it was also found that regardless of lecture delivery method, STEM subjects in general remained challenging that was suggested by the consistently high recorded heart rates, which was also a sign of active learning engagement-besides implying the level of stress. Finally, gender-wise, there is no visible data pattern that could hint that certain gender is more vulnerable to stress when handling STEM subjects. © 2024, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

We also observed what mathematics content, grouping strategies, and management formats teachers engaged during classroom mathematics activities. Each observation lasted approximately 2 hours; collectively these observations focused on 930 children observed one to three times during the 2018/2019 or 2019/2020 school year. Averaging across individuals’ data within classrooms, we found that mathematics and literacy activities comprised 5% and 45% of time observed in preschool classrooms, respectively; and 25% and 42% of time observed in kindergarten classrooms, respectively. At both grades, when mathematics activities occurred, they were proportionally more often teacher-led rather than child-led. These findings raise concerns about the paucity of mathematics and over-reliance on developmentally inappropriate teacher-managed mathematics instruction in early childhood classrooms, especially preschools. Amount of time in math did not vary by preschool auspice, but time in literacy and the proportion of math time devoted to specific math content did: In Head Start classrooms we observed lowest percentage of time in literacy (and the highest percentage of time in non-instruction) compared to all other auspices. Across auspices, numeracy was the predominant math content area overall, but especially in Head Start classrooms. Thus, some aspects of early mathematics may differ with program auspice, suggesting that recommendations to increase and improve early mathematics activities may need to consider auspice characteristics. © 2024"

However, contradictions remain regarding the widespread nature of these benefits, particularly when it comes to academic motivation. Aims: In this large-scale cross-sectional study, we relied on the Big-Fish-Little-Pond Effect (BFLPE) to assess the links between inclusive education and students’ academic self-concepts and learning interests in the mathematics and verbal domains. Sample: The sample consisted of 21,219 German elementary school children in Grade 4 who were enrolled in three groups: students without SEN attending regular schools (n1 = 19,069), students with SEN attending regular schools (n2 = 933), and students with SEN attending special education schools (n3 = 1214). Methods: Doubly latent multi-group multilevel structural equation models and tests of latent interaction were performed to test the BFLPE. Results: Results supported the BFLPE for both outcomes and domains. However, no BFLPE was identified for learning interest in the verbal domain among students with SEN attending special education schools, although the size of this effect did not differ significantly from that observed among students without SEN. In regular schools, the BFLPE was almost two times stronger among students with SEN than among their peers without SEN. Conclusions: Results support the generalizability of the BFLPE to students with SEN, while casting doubts on the motivational benefits of inclusive education for these students. Interventions targeted at attenuating the BFLPE should thus be tailored for both regular and special education schools. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

First, the proposed model is developed with kinematic and friction nonlinearities, and the corresponding governing equations are obtained. Governing equations are then solved numerically for certain operating parameters, and the characteristics of different dynamic responses are investigated. It is observed from the numerical solutions that the dynamic response of the system can be deterministic or chaotic based on the set of operating parameters. Furthermore, the period doubling mechanism is found to be the path from deterministic to chaotic behavior. Second, experiments are performed at a wide range of operating parameters in order to calculate the dynamic friction coefficient, which are used in artificial neural network models for the generation of friction models as functions of operating parameters. It is observed that these operating parameters have significant influence on the variation of the dynamic friction coefficient. Third, the friction models developed with artificial neural network approach are implemented in the nonlinear mathematical model, and numerical solutions are obtained at the same operating parameters. Finally, the numerical results of the low order nonlinear mathematical model are compared to the experimental data, and it is concluded that there is a good correlation between the model predictions and measurements from the perspectives of fundamental frequencies and the characteristics of the dynamic responses. Hence, a better insight about the dynamic response behavior of the mass-sliding belt experiment is achieved through the bifurcation analyses. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, little is known on students’ circumstances and efforts in an attempt to reduce these inequalities. The aim of this paper therefore is to analyse inequality of opportunity in Cameroon's primary education sector. Using the 2014 and 2019 PASEC databases, we decompose students’ reading and mathematics test scores based on Shapley and non-parametric approaches to assess the role of household, school and environmental circumstances. Results show that inequality of opportunity contributes between 38.1 % and 46.3 % of total inequality for between 2014 and 2019 in test scores. Interestingly, school factors like school type, location, resources, and class size, have a bigger impact than students’ family background. Policies to improve school conditions should focus on rural and under-resourced areas in terms of educational materials, while improving school inspections and reducing class sizes may be more effective in reducing educational inequalities. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, open questions remain regarding how different types of back matter may affect caregivers’ ability to use fraction picture books as a teaching tool. The current study offers a novel investigation into how back matter affects caregivers’ (N = 160) fraction understanding (i.e., equivalence and arithmetic) and subjective beliefs about math using a pretest/posttest design. We contrasted existing back matter text with research-informed back matter text crossed with either circle area or number line visual displays. Caregivers’ performance improved from pretest to posttest in the Researcher-Generated + Circles condition (fraction equivalence) and in the Existing + Circles, Researcher-Generated + Circles, and Researcher-Generated + Number Lines conditions (fraction arithmetic). In addition, caregivers were aware of their learning; they predicted improvements in their fraction arithmetic performance over time. These findings suggest that brief interventions, such as back matter in children's picture books, may improve adults’ fraction understanding. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

The main drivers of these changes are alterations in the amount, intensity or type of precipitation, glacier melting, or thawing of permafrost ice. The hazard responses can involve a change in hazard intensity or frequency (increasing or decreasing), a shift in their location or, a shift from one type of hazard to another. As climate change impacts vary in space and time, this variability must be considered when planning measures to protect populations and infrastructure from hazardous processes. To support this, we developed a method for assessing the climate sensitivity of small individual rock releases and larger rockfall processes. The method is based on a fuzzy logic approach and uses highly resolved climate scenario data, allowing application on a regional or even larger scale. The application in a study area of 700 km2 in the central Valais (Switzerland) shows that the impacts of climate change on natural hazard processes can vary quite substantially across small spatial scales. Generally, an increase in rockfall frequency and magnitude is simulated under future warming scenarios, especially at higher altitudes. However, at lower elevations and on south-exposed slopes, a decrease in freeze-thaw cycles leads to a decrease in material availability. This knowledge is essential in discussions of how climate change should be considered in hazard and disaster management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

This paper aims to examine the stochastic dynamics of the EMEHS system with time-delayed feedback and fractional derivative damping under random road excitation. The equivalent system can be obtained by variable transformation, followed by the derivation of the steady-state probability density function using stochastic averaging method. The consistency between numerical simulation and analytical results verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results indicate the existence of stochastic bifurcation phenomenon. The influences of fractional order, delayed time, fractional coefficient, and nonlinear damping coefficient on the stochastic P-bifurcation of the system are discussed individually in detail. Then the output performance of the EMEHS system is illustrated by presenting the mean square current and mean output power. The conclusions demonstrate that adjusting parameters such as fractional order, delayed time, and noise intensity can enhance the energy harvested from road vibrations.

Different from the traditional mode-III moving crack, this paper studies a Yoffe-type anti-plane shear crack subjected to couple tractions, not force tractions, on the crack faces. The governing equation is first deduced. Employing the Fourier transform, one derives two hypersingular integral equations for prescribed bending and twisting couple stresses on the crack surfaces, respectively. With the help of the Chebyshev series expansion, each hypersingular integral equation is converted to a system of linear algebraic equations. The strain and couple/force stress intensity factors are numerically calculated. Based on the numerical results, the couple/force stress field as well as the strain energy density is derived for each case. The obtained results indicate the size-dependent mechanical behavior. Moreover, the velocity and flexure–torsion effect may cause a redistribution of the couple/force stress field. The crack velocity and flexure–torsion effect also play an important role in assessing the crack bifurcation angle. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Leveraging Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study Advanced 2015 data from 1729 physics instructors across nine countries, it probes the extent to which collaborative practices among teachers influence their teaching to enhance active learning and engagement. Analytical techniques include Spearman correlations, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling. Results reveal a robust model, confirmed by a Comparative Fit Index of 0.989 and Tucker-Lewis Index of 0.988, suggesting a good fit with the empirical data, alongside a Root Mean Square Error of Approximation of 0.053. The analysis demonstrates that teacher collaboration (‘Collab’) significantly predicts active learning (‘Active’) with a notable effect (β = 0.344, p < 0.001), which in turn significantly enhances student engagement (‘Engage’) (β = 0.438, p < 0.001). Additionally, ‘Engage’ is also directly influenced by ‘Collab’ (β = 0.174, p < 0.001). Although the relationship between ‘Collab’ and physics achievement (‘Physics’) is weaker, it remains significant (β = 0.063, p = 0.019). These findings support the enhancement of teacher collaboration as a catalyst for active learning and student engagement, which could indirectly foster improvements in physics achievement globally. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd."

Notably, there is a dearth of understanding regarding how homework effects vary across different subjects, how student backgrounds may moderate its effectiveness, what the optimal amount and distribution of homework is, and how the causal impact of homework can be disentangled from other associations. Aims: This study examines the different effects of homework frequency and duration on student achievement in both mathematics and science while adopting a causal inference probabilistic framework. Sample: Our data consists of a nationally representative sample of 4118 Irish eighth grade students, collected as part of TIMSS 2019. Methods: We employ an extension of a causal inference machine learning model called Bayesian Causal Forests that allows us to consider the effect of homework on achievement in mathematics and science simultaneously. By investigating the impacts of both homework frequency and duration, we discern the optimal frequency and duration for homework in both subjects. Additionally, we explore the potential moderating role of student socioeconomic backgrounds. Results: Daily homework benefitted mathematics achievement the most, while three to four days per week was most effective for science. Short-duration assignments proved equally as effective as longer ones in both subjects. Notably, students from advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds did not gain more from homework. Conclusions: These findings can guide policies aimed at enhancing student outcomes while promoting a balance between academic responsibilities and extracurricular activities. © 2024 The Authors"

Thus, this research aims to refigure how students who receive Realistic Mathematics Education (RME) literacy and numeracy skills improve based on teacher's experiences. The research subjects are third, fourth, and fifth-grade students in elementary schools in Padang. Three schools were selected for each grade level and taught by three teachers with different experiences. The students were given literacy and numeracy problems before and after RME instruction. The answers were assessed and grouped to examine the student's literacy and numeracy achievement. The research results show that student's literacy and numeracy skills are better with RME learning.

Preschool teachers exhibit considerable variability in the amount and types of mathematics activities they engage in with their students; one potentially important source of these individual differences is adults’ knowledge of early math development. The current study aimed to describe preschool teachers’ knowledge of numeracy, patterning, and spatial/geometric skills developed in preschool and its relation to their reported mathematics instruction. Participants (N = 83) completed a survey in which they judged whether particular early math skills could be observed in typically developing 4-year-olds in the United States and reported their frequency of engaging in different math instructional activities. Pre- and in-service preschool teachers’ knowledge varied across the different domains (i.e., numeracy, patterning, and spatial/geometric) of mathematical thinking, but their reported frequency of instruction did not. Teachers who were found to be more accurate in their knowledge of early math development were more likely to report higher frequency of math instruction; looking specifically at the domains, the strength of association between knowledge and instruction was the strongest for numeracy. Such findings highlight the possibility that supporting preschool teachers’ knowledge of the range of math skills their students can be developing may be one component of improving early math teaching and learning. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

This paper addresses two related aspects of this phenomenon. On the one hand, it asks: to the extent that the significance of the life sciences was indeed downplayed by early analytic philosophers, why was this the case? An answer to this question may be found in Bertrand Russell’s 1914 discussions of the relation between biology and philosophy. Contrary to received views of the history of analytic philosophy, Russell presented his own ‘logical atomism’ in opposition not only to British Idealism, but also to ‘evolutionism’. On the other hand, I will question whether this purported neglect of the life sciences does indeed accurately characterise the history of analytic philosophy. In answering this, I turn first to Susan Stebbing’s criticisms of Russell’s overlooking of biology, her influence on J.H. Woodger, and her critical discussion of T.H. Huxley’s and C.H. Waddington’s application of evolutionary views to philosophical questions. I then discuss the case of Moritz Schlick, whose evolutionist philosophy has been overlooked within recent debates concerning Logical Empiricism’s relation to the philosophy of biology. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

The collision risk analysis of MASS reveals unsolved challenges, which without appropriate solutions, will result in the error prone development of the relevant risk control measures and policies. Among the challenges, two significant ones in the existing literature are the lack of historical failure data to realise quantitative risk assessment, and 2) the complex causal relationship among the relevant risk factors. This paper aims to develop a new Fault Tree Analysis-Fuzzy Bayesian Network (FTA-FBN) model to conduct the collision risk assessment of MASS with uncertainty in data. First, it establishes a causal relationship among the risk factors through an FTA. Secondly, mapping the obtained FTA diagram into a BN allows fault diagnosis and the identification of the most important factors influencing MASS collisions. In this process, a survey is conducted to collect the primary data for configuring the conditional probabilities of the relevant influential factors and quantifying the developed BN for risk diagnosis and prediction. Finally, the new model is verified by using sensitivity analysis and three axioms and then applied to conduct scenario-based risk prediction and diagnosis to generate insightful findings to guide MASS navigation safety. The results demonstrate that the FTA-FBN model realizes the simplification of the expert scoring process, reduces computational complexity, and addresses the challenge of constructing causal relationships between MASS collisions and their risk factors due to the scarcity of historical accident data. Additionally, the BN backward reasoning identifies key collision risks, including external physical attacks, inadequate training of shore-based operators, insufficient maintenance of ship equipment and systems, and cyber-security threats. The new model when being adapted, can provide a reference for the formulation of safe navigation policies and provide important insights for shipping companies to ensure the safe navigation of their ships and shipbuilders to optimise ship design. © 2024 The Authors"

The emphasis is put specifically on the tracking of predicted limit point (LP) bifurcations as key parameters - such as the amplitude of the aerodynamic forcing applied on the blade, the friction coefficient or the operating clearances - vary. Overall, presented results underline that the employed frequency method is well-suited to tackle the numerical challenges inherent to such computations on high-dimensional systems.

This paper presents an efficient privacy-preserving semantic-aware multi-keyword ranked search scheme (EPSMR) over encrypted cloud data. EPSMR utilizes the LDA topic model to discover hidden semantic information in documents and convert documents into vector representations. vector encryption by using the secure inner product is employed to implement the privacy-preserving semantic relevance score computation between search keywords and documents.

This paper considers the Clustered Spanning Tree by Paths problem, denoted by CSTP. This problem aims to decide whether a feasible solution tree exists, spanning all vertices of V, such that each cluster induces a path in the solution tree. We introduce the idea of a minimum cardinality feasible removal list and a minimum cardinality feasible insertion list, which removes or inserts vertices from or into clusters, such that using each one of the lists separately creates hypergraphs with feasible solution trees for CSTP. In addition, we decompose the intersection graph of H into smaller instances, for those cases where the intersection graph contains a cut node or a separating edge. We demonstrate how to compose a minimum cardinality feasible removal list or a minimum cardinality feasible insertion list of a given hypergraph from the smaller minimum cardinality feasible removal lists or minimum cardinality feasible insertion lists of the smaller instances.

Single nucleotide mutations (SNM) are the most abundant type of mutations among them. Here, we perform a meta-analysis to quantify the influence of selected global genomic parameters (genome size, genomic GC content, genomic repeat fraction, number of coding genes, gene count, and strand bias in prokaryotes) and local genomic features (local GC content, repeat content, CpG content and the number of SNM at CpG islands) on spontaneous SNM rates across the tree of life (prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes, multicellular eukaryotes) using wild-type sequence data in two different taxon classification systems. We find that the spontaneous SNM rates in our data are correlated with many genomic features in prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes irrespective of their sample sizes. On the other hand, only the number of coding genes was correlated with the spontaneous SNM rates in multicellular eukaryotes primarily contributed by vertebrates data. Considering local features, we notice that local GC content and CpG content significantly were correlated with the spontaneous SNM rates in the unicellular eukaryotes, while local repeat fraction is an important feature in prokaryotes and certain specific uni- and multi-cellular eukaryotes. Such predictive features of the spontaneous SNM rates often support non-linear models as the best fit compared to the linear model. We also observe that the strand asymmetry in prokaryotes plays an important role in determining the spontaneous SNM rates but the SNM spectrum does not. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The propagation is described by a system of J perturbed coupled nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equations. The NN interaction property leads to the elimination of collisional three-pulse interaction effects, which prevented the observation of stable multisequence soliton propagation with J>2 sequences in the presence of generic GL gain–loss in all previous studies. We show that the dynamics of soliton amplitudes can be described by a generalized J-dimensional Lotka–Volterra (LV) model. Stability and bifurcation analysis for the equilibrium points of the LV model, which is augmented by an application of the Lyapunov function method, is used to develop setups that lead to robust and scalable transmission stabilization and switching for a general J value. The predictions of the LV model are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations with the perturbed coupled-NLS model with J=3, 4, and 5 soliton sequences. Furthermore, soliton stability and the agreement between the LV model's predictions and the simulations are not reduced with increasing value of J. Therefore, our study provides the first demonstration of robust control of multiple colliding sequences of NLS solitons in the presence of generic weak GL gain–loss with an arbitrary number of sequences. Due to the robustness and scalability of the results, they can have important applications in stabilization and switching of broadband soliton-based optical waveguide transmission. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Unfortunately, program module labeling is often time-consuming and error-prone. Semi-supervised software defect prediction (SSDP) can alleviate this issue by incorporating some labeled modules and the remaining unlabeled modules from the same project. Objective: However, previous SSDP methods ignore the significant influence of dependencies between software modules. The potential of knowledge distillation in leveraging labeled instances to guide the learning process and effectively utilizing information from unlabeled instances to improve SSDP performance has not been fully investigated. Method: We propose a novel approach SeDPGK. Specifically, to exploit the graph-structured knowledge, we first construct the program dependence graph to extract control and data dependencies among modules. Then we use graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the graph representation of the module relationships and encode with the statement semantics of abstract syntax tree and traditional static features for diversity. Second, we integrate multiple GNNs jointly trained as teacher models to ensemble various styles of graph-based networks and generate trustworthy labels for unlabeled modules. Further, to preserve the teacher model's sufficient structure and semantic knowledge, we adopt a trainable label propagation and multi-layer perception as the student model and mitigate the differences between the teacher and student models using two widespread knowledge distillation functions. Results: We conducted our experiments on 17 real-world projects. The experimental results show that SeDPGK outperforms semi-supervised baselines with an average improvement of 16.9% for PD, 42.5% for FAR, and 8.9% for AUC, respectively. Moreover, the performance improvement is consistently significant across multiple statistical tests. Conclusion: The effectiveness of SeDPGK comes from the aggregation of the different GNNs with heterogeneity. Moreover, the graph structure and semantic features hidden behind the source code play a crucial role in the distillation framework. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

However, the nonlinear response mechanism of the friction induced vibration (FIV) energy harvesting system with multiple stability and stick-slip motion is still unclear. In the current paper, a novel nonlinear energy harvesting model with multiple stability of single-, double- and triple-well potential is proposed based on V-shaped structure spring and the belt conveying system. The dynamic equations for the energy harvesting system with multiple stability and self-excited friction are established by using Euler-Lagrangian equations. Secondly, the static characteristics of the nonlinear restoring force, the friction force, and the potential energy surfaces are obtained to show the nonlinear stiffness, multiple equilibrium points, discontinuous behaviors and multiple well responses. Then, the equilibrium surface of bifurcation sets for the autonomous system is given to show the third-order quasi zero stiffness (QZS3), fifth-order quasi zero stiffness (QZS5), double well (DW) and triple well (TW). The co-dimension bifurcation sets of the self-excited vibration system are analyzed and the corresponding phase portraits for the coexistent of multiple limit cycles are obtained. Furthermore, the analytical formula of amplitude frequency response of the approximated system are obtained by the complex harmonic method. The response amplitudes of charge, current, voltage and power of the forced electron-mechanical coupled vibration system for QZS3, QZS5, DW and TW are analyzed by using the numerically solution. Finally, a prototype of FIV energy harvesting system is manufactured and the experimental system is setup. The experimental works of static restoring forces, damping forcse and the electrical outputs are well agreeable with the numerical results, which testified the proposed FIV energy harvesting model. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Its objective is to alleviate mathematics anxiety, a prevalent negative emotion, and enhance well-being during mathematical learning. Drawing upon flow theory from positive psychology, the research endeavors to optimize mathematical well-being by crafting appropriately challenging questions.

Data collection involves observation, interviews, tests, and documentation, with analysis employing data reduction, presentation, triangulation, and verification techniques. The study utilizes socio-religious problems as a context, one of the characteristics of RME, such as inheritance division, to design mathematical challenges. The findings demonstrate a marked transition from math anxiety to math well-being, manifested through heightened enthusiasm and cheerfulness in learning mathematics, particularly by the mother. Noteworthy transformations include increased engagement, generous gestures towards the teacher, and frequent smiling, contrasting with previous instances of math anxiety during learning sessions.

On the other hand, the growth and expansion of the use of RE requires cooperation and participation in the Renewable Energy Supply Chain (RESC). The strategic alliance between the parties involved in the field of RE can play an important role in reducing risk and significant growth in RESC. Also, due to various capabilities such as transparency, traceability, decentralization, security, and immutability of information, blockchain plays an important role in improving trust and strengthening cooperation in strategic alliances between partners in RESC. Therefore, this study proposes a decision-making framework under uncertainty for integrating blockchain and strategic alliance in RESC. The proposed framework involves the CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) and Fuzzy Combined Compromise Solution (F-CoCoSo) techniques. Also, validation and sensitivity analysis are performed using several fuzzy decision-making techniques.

The airborne electromagnetic (AEM) method is an efficient data acquisition technique and can be used to image the underground resistivity structure with high spatial resolution. However, inversion of the increasingly huge volume of AEM data poses a heavy computational burden. In this study, we develop a hybrid deep learning-based approach by using the physics-guided neural network (PGNN) which incorporates the governing physical laws into the loss function to solve the AEM inverse problem. The PGNN integrates the strength of data-driven method for representation learning with electromagnetic laws and allows for the underlying physical constraints to be strictly satisfied. We validate the effectiveness of our approach using both synthetic and field datasets. Compared with the classic Gauss–Newton method, our PGNN inversion system shows strong robustness against multiple noise sources and reduces the risk of being trapped in local extrema. Moreover, the PGNN-inverted results are physically more consistent with the AEM observations compared to the purely data-driven approach. Application to the field AEM data from Northern Australia demonstrates that the PGNN-based inversion framework effectively estimates the subsurface electrical properties with considerable lateral continuity and significantly higher efficiency, completing the inversion of more than 2734000 AEM soundings taking only minutes on a common PC. Our proposed PGNN-based method shows great promise for large-scale underground resistivity imaging, and the well-identified subsurface resistivity structure can effectively improve our understanding of resource distributions and geological hazards. © The Author(s) 2024.

PROPs and PROBs are categories used to encode structures borne by objects in symmetric and braided monoidal categories respectively, whilst crossed simplicial groups are categories which encode a unital, associative multiplication and a compatible group action. We will produce PROPs and PROBs whose categories of algebras are equivalent to the categories of monoids, comonoids and bimonoids with group action using extensions of the symmetric and braid crossed simplicial groups.

The generalized extension of the q-rung orthopair fuzzy set in combination with the soft set (SS) is introduced to determine which location is most likely to be favourable for urban growth. The Aczel–Alsina aggregation operators (AA'AOs) for q-rung orthopair fuzzy soft set (q-ROFSS) are formulated. The generalized nature of q-ROFSS is due to flexibility in the index of membership and non-membership, which provide decision-makers more freedom to express their opinions. The developed AA'AOs are based on the Aczel–Alsina (AA) t-norm and t-conorm that emphasize parameter variability. Important properties of these operators are studied. A novel approach based on q-ROFSS is established. The approach is tested with a case study problem related to urbanization. In this scenario, a company is searching for the best possible area to develop a housing society. The results show that the approach is highly valuable and easily applicable. The stability of the operators is examined through comparative analysis. The findings of sensitivity analysis show that increasing parameters in q-ROFSS leads to diminishing the impact of the non-membership operation, indicating geometric expansion and mathematical rebalancing of dominance between operations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Through careful analysis, we have determined that even small changes in the initial conditions have little impact on the stability of the solution, which has been confirmed by employing the Runge-Kutta method.

Solar energy's uncertain and intermittent characteristics require interaction with the building integrated energy system (BIES) and central grid. The design of solar integration in the community is proposed, and six types of BIESs with different components and configurations are constructed. The power and heat coordination is implemented through hybrid installations, such as solar heat collectors and photovoltaic panels, and electricity and heat storage. A multi-criteria fuzzy decision-making method combining a multi-objective optimization model of hybrid solar BIES is developed to select the optimal scheme. The multi-objective optimization is modeled to optimize the capacities of components in the BIES alternative in minimizing annual total fuel consumption, cost, and CO2 emission, which obtains Pareto solutions. Then, a fuzzy multi-criteria evaluation approach is proposed to consider quantitative performances and qualitative advancements and judgments from experts and respondents and to select the best BIES scheme for the prosumer community. The heat and power coordination of the optimal BIES scheme is discussed. A case study demonstrates the validation of the proposed approach. The results illustrate that the photovoltaic modules installed on roofs and south walls of buildings supply approximately 12.66% of total energy demands. The fuzzy weighting method analyzed the weights of 4 main criteria and 14 sub-criteria, and the renewable energy penetration rate and annual total emission of CO2 have the largest weights, 0.148 and 0.113. The technical, environmental, economic, and social weights are 0.421, 0.215, 0.201, and 0.164, respectively. The closeness coefficient of the optimum scheme with the ideal BIES scheme is 0.637. © 2024 International Solar Energy Society"

To address these challenges, researchers have introduced unsupervised pre-trained models specifically tailored for mathematics education, yielding promising outcomes. However, the existing literature fails to consider the domain-specific characteristics of mathematics, particularly the structural features in pre-trained corpora and extensive expressions, which makes them costly expensive and time-consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose a lightweight expression-enhanced large-scale pre-trained language model, called EBERT, for mathematics education. Specifically, we select a large number of expression-enriched exercises to further pre-train the original BERT. To depict the inherent structural features existed in expressions, the initial step involves the creation of an Operator Tree for each expression. Subsequently, each exercise is transformed into a corresponding Question&Answer tree (QAT) to serve as the model input. Notably, to ensure the preservation of semantic integrity within the QAT, a specialized Expression Enhanced Matrix is devised to confine the visibility of individual tokens. Additionally, a new pre-training task, referred to as Question&Answer Matching, is introduced to capture exercise-related structural information at the semantic level. Through three downstream tasks in mathematical education, we prove that EBERT outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines (such as MathBERT and GPT-3) in terms of ACC and F1-score. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The existence and nonlinear dynamic features of combustion instability in non-premixed methane combustion are experimentally examined by varying IFGR nozzle structures and global equivalence ratios (Φ). The experimental observations reveal that the flammability limits and stability maps are transited according to different IFGR nozzle structures. Combustion instabilities are prone to occur in lean conditions due to the intensified axial and tangential heat release rate oscillations. Multiple combustion states and two bifurcations in thermoacoustic instability by decreasing global equivalence ratios are found. In the discussion and analysis, a computational method of convection time is established for non-premixed combustion. To compensate for the lack of experimental data of local species/flow fields, numerical simulations are conducted to achieve quantitative data of convection time. A convection time of 34 ms triggers the limit cycle oscillation modes in the experiments, corresponding to the 2nd thermoacoustic delay time in the combustion system. Varying IFGR structures and global equivalence ratios have impacts on the flow velocity in the oxidant mixture, and thus, the convection time is changed. When the convection time is coupled with the thermoacoustic delay time in the combustion system, combustion instability occurs. This work establishes a link between IFGR nozzles and combustion instability in non-premixed methane combustion, and highlights the influence of varying nozzle structures and global equivalence ratios on convection time and the flow velocity in the oxidant mixture in non-premixed combustion, which can provide a foundation for further studies on combustion instability in various low-NOx combustion types. © 2024"

One potential pathway is through encountering story problems where the location of the unknown quantity varies. Aims: The goal of the present study is to characterize how arithmetic problem-solving strategy sophistication can evolve through opportunities to solve story problems. Sample: We used microgenetic principles to guide the coding of arithmetic problem-solving behavior (8843 attempts) across three timescales (time within-session, attempt to solve, and between sessions) for nine story problem structures (N = 40, 19 girls). Data come from a teaching experiment conducted in a Mountain West US state in Spring 2018. Methods: We employed a Bayesian hierarchical ordinal regression with a nine-level response variable. The model contained fixed effects for session, attempt, story problem structure; a smooth time within session effect; and random effects for student, instructor, and equation. Results: Our analysis indicates which transitions from less to more sophisticated strategies are better supported by additional attempts to solve the same problem vs. additional instructional sessions. Strategy sophistication also varied by the location of the unknown quantity (result unknown, find difference, start unknown), but not operation (join, separate, part-whole). Conclusions: If confirmed by other studies, including experiments, what teachers offer children in terms of learning opportunities (more attempts within the same problem or more problems across work sessions) should vary based on the transition they are making. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Numerous studies have extensively investigated the impacts of 2D/3D urban features on LST. However, the diurnal impacts have not been comprehensively understood. Therefore, taking 1, 510 blocks within the 4th ring road of Beijing as samples, this study examined the influence of urban features (2D: low vegetation, water, and impervious surface; 3D: buildings and trees) on diurnal LST at the block scale based on ECOSTRESS LST using boosted regression tree (BRT) algorithm. The results showed that trees exhibit better cooling effects than low vegetation except at 3:09. The 3D features exhibited a greater impact on diurnal LST compared with 2D features, and it contributed strongly to daytime LST, which was 27.8 % on average higher than the 2D features. Building and tree densities had the greatest influence on daytime LST, while building height influenced nighttime LST the most. The impacts of key metrics on diurnal LST were nonlinear, and the relationship had diurnal variations. Taller buildings and trees were negatively correlated with LST during the daytime and transition time, but positively correlated with nighttime LST. The findings provide insights into landscape optimization strategies to improve block thermal comfort. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Traditional machine learning methods also struggle to analyze the physical correlations between model outputs, parameters, and data. In this paper, a two-stage equation for hydrogen-assisted FCG is proposed using Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering Using Hierarchies (BIRCH) clustering and domain knowledge-guided symbol regression. The segmentation of crack growth data is achieved through the BIRCH algorithm and outputs the transitive stress intensity factor Kt, while domain knowledge is obtained by analyzing the symbol regression (SR) trees of six existing semi-empirical models. By constraining the symbol regression search space with variable subtrees including ΔK, ΔKth, R, KIH, and KIC, a SR model is developed based on the ×60-5.5 MPa-R0.5 test data. The applicability of the equation under different conditions was validated using test data from X60-5.5 MPa-R0.1, X60-21 MPa-R0.1, X60-21 MPa-R0.5, X42-6.9 MPa-R0.1, and X42-6.9 MPa-R0.8. The results indicate that our model outperforms the other six semi-empirical crack propagation rate models, achieving higher prediction accuracy with a minimum R2 value of 0.968912 and a maximum RMSE value of 0.000003. Therefore, this two-stage model accurately captures the hydrogen-assisted FCGR and enhances the predictive capability of fatigue life in a hydrogen environment, providing valuable references for hydrogen-related pipeline design and operational safety. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"

From a biophysical standpoint, integrating piezoelectric devices into a nonlinear neuron circuit enables the conversion of external pressure or sound wave signals into electrical signals. The primary content of this research are as follows: initially, the piezoelectric neuron system is analytically solved by employing the TMRM, yielding high-precision periodic solutions. Subsequently, a detailed bifurcation analysis is performed leveraging these high-precision solutions. The findings demonstrate that the neuronal system experiences a periodic-doubling bifurcation when the amplitude of external stimuli surpasses a specific threshold. With further increases in the stimulus, this periodic-doubling response evolves into a periodic response. Moreover, changes in cell membrane resistance will lead to complex nonlinear behaviors such as stable or unstable period-1 solutions and stable or unstable and critically stable period-3 solutions in the system.

However, incomplete information caused by uncertainties from multiple sources and fluctuations in inherent properties during engineering practice can seriously interfere with obtaining singular values. Based on the convex set uncertainty theory, a novel convex set-oriented singular value decomposition (CSSVD) is proposed to overcome the limitations of using the nominal SVD method. The CSSVD aims to accurately and efficiently calculate the uncertainty bounds of singular values and vectors through the bounds and correlations of initial uncertainty parameters. Traditional probability methods rely on a sufficient sample size, and when the sample size is insufficient, accurate results cannot be obtained. However, the CSSVD method is based on set theory and can still demonstrate excellent performance in scenarios with small samples. This study investigates the detailed derivation steps of the proposed CSSVD method, taking into consideration properties such as normalization, orthogonality, and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) to verify the accurate bounds of convex sets. The proposed method is finally applied to several numerical examples to demonstrate its superiority. This includes verifying singular values and vectors, handling high-order matrices, matrices with close singular values, and rectangular matrices. An application of image denoising is also used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2024"

Previous studies on this apparently ‘familiar’ structural problem have yielded controversial results, necessitating a comprehensive clarification. This study shows that results previously labelled as ‘correct’ or ‘wrong’ simply refer to different external constraints, whose presence becomes necessary only for the two latter loads, (ii.) and (iii.). Moreover, the paper presents the first experimental realization of a circular rod subjected to centrally-directed loads. The experimental findings align with the theoretical predictions and show the exploitation of a new type of load acting on a continuous structural element.

The framework provides in particular the following features: interfaces to manipulate meshes and fields, services to deal with different physical solvers, setup of coupling trees to realize multiphysics partitioned (accelerated) fixed point couplings, automated time-marching algorithm, checkpoint/restart strategies, capability to realize on-the-fly multiscale couplings. It is built with a permanent concern for sustainability, scalability and maintainability. PLEIADES framework supports multidimensional simulations, typically 1D, 2D and 3D, possibly multilayered. To date, this framework relies on the generic thermomechanical finite elements solver Cast3M to deal with partial derivative problems (mechanical, thermal or diffusion problems) at the scale of the structure or the (heterogeneous) microstructure. It also makes use of so-called point models (mainly based on ODE — ordinary differential equations) to describe the local (mesoscale) evolution of the material through the physics of irradiation. Several software applications are built on the PLEIADES framework, they can use its parallel features to use multiple processors. The multilayered calculation scheme provides a way to loosen the computations and access to a good parallel performance up to hundred cores. It is also possible to achieve efficient scalable concurrent multiscale simulations through finite element square (FE2) computational homogenization algorithms. © 2024"

They appear as key players in many branches of physics, mathematics, and other sciences. Despite their widespread significance, how to compute distances between pairs of points on compact Riemann surfaces is surprisingly unknown, unless the surface is a sphere or a torus. This is because on higher-genus surfaces, the distance formula involves an infimum over infinitely many terms, so it cannot be evaluated in practice. Here we derive a computable distance formula for a broad class of Riemann surfaces. The formula reduces the infimum to a minimum over an explicit set consisting of finitely many terms. We also develop a distance computation algorithm, which cannot be expressed as a formula, but which is more computationally efficient on surfaces with high genuses. We illustrate both the formula and the algorithm in application to generalized Bolza surfaces, which are a particular class of highly symmetric compact Riemann surfaces of any genus greater than 1. © 2024 The Author(s).

However, the utilization of ultracapacitors in existing energy management strategies is insufficient, preventing complete exploitation of the energy storage system's benefits. To strengthen the utilization of ultracapacitors, this paper proposes an energy management strategy for fuel cell vehicles with three energy sources, considering the ideal state of charge (SOC) of ultracapacitors. The proposed method disassembles the motor power demand, with the ultracapacitor primarily supplying the acceleration portion. It calculates the ideal SOC of the ultracapacitor, and controlling the actual SOC of the ultracapacitor to match the ideal SOC. Furthermore, a fuzzy logic controller is designed to modify the fuel cell's output power, reducing power fluctuation. Additionally, according to the variation of the SOC of the battery, the fuel cell output power is modified to enhance the overall performance of the composite energy storage system. Simulation and hardware-in-loop results demonstrate that, compared to the adaptive filtering strategy with fuel cell power constraints and dynamic programming strategy, the strategy proposed in this paper reduces operational costs by 14.56 % and 4.99 %, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Prior research has largely focused on the question of how language shapes mathematical thinking. The current study considers the converse question. Specifically, it investigates whether the magnitude representations that are thought to anchor understanding of number are also recruited to understand the meanings of graded words. These are words that come in scales (e.g., Anger) whose members can be ordered by the degree to which they possess the defining property (e.g., calm, annoyed, angry, furious). Experiment 1 uses the comparison paradigm to find evidence that the distance, ratio, and boundary effects that are taken as evidence of the recruitment of magnitude representations extend from numbers to words. Experiment 2 uses a similarity rating paradigm and multi-dimensional scaling to find converging evidence for these effects in graded word understanding. Experiment 3 evaluates an alternative hypothesis – that these effects for graded words simply reflect the statistical structure of the linguistic environment – by using machine learning models of distributional word semantics: LSA, word2vec, GloVe, counterfitted word vectors, BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2. These models fail to show the full pattern of effects observed of humans in Experiment 2, suggesting that more is needed than mere statistics. This research paves the way for further investigations of the role of magnitude representations in sentence and text comprehension, and of the question of whether language understanding and number understanding draw on shared or independent magnitude representations. It also informs the role of machine learning models in cognitive psychology research. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

However, ground stations are generally limited, with nearly 40% of countries having no official PM2.5 stations, not allowing air quality analysis for a significantly large share of the world's population. Furthermore, limited studies analyze community data from a geodemographic perspective, in other words, to delineate the sociodemographic profiles and geographically locate the socioeconomic groups more exposed to ambient air pollution. Therefore, a significant question arises: How can we trace vulnerable communities to air pollution in areas lacking air-quality ground data? Here, we propose a novel methodology to respond to this question. We use NO2, SO2, CO, and HCHO tropospheric column air-quality data from Sentinel-5P, a satellite that quantifies concentrations of atmospheric species from space operationally. We integrate them with census and environmental data and apply the local fuzzy geographically weighted clustering spatial machine learning method for segmentation analysis. Our findings for Bali, Indonesia, provide quantitative evidence for the benefits of this methodology in tracing and delineating the profiles of the communities most exposed to air pollution. For example, results show that communities with highly disadvantaged populations, such as unemployed (over 27.8%), low educated (over 27.9%), and children (over 22.1%) (mainly located around Bali's south and north coast touristic areas), exhibit very high values (over the 75th quartile) across the pollutants studied. The proposed method is reproducible easily, quickly, and at low cost, as it is based on freely available satellite data and not on costly ground station measurements. This will hopefully assist decision-makers in tracing the most vulnerable subpopulations, even in areas with inadequate air-quality monitoring networks, thus allowing local governments around the globe (even those that are financially weak) to achieve environmental justice and their sustainable development goals. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Generally, PQ problems mitigation strategy has turned into a critical issue in grid-connected PV systems. This paper proposes a control topology for PQ issues mitigation scheme in grid connected PV systems. The primary goal of this study is to enhance the PQ in power distribution system through eradicating the voltage interruption, voltage swell and sag as well as voltage fluctuation. To accomplish these changes, Unified Power Quality Conditioners (UPQCs) with controllers were utilized. Then the faults are mitigated by the utilization of UPQC with Tree Seeds Algorithm (TSA) - Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Interference System (ANFIS). At first, the normal properties of the grid-connected PV systems are dissected. From that point forward, a few interruptions are made in the system and the abnormal characteristics are analyzed. Then the abnormal characteristics of PQ problems are diminished in the utilization of UPQC and TSA-ANFIS controllers. UPQC is one of the best filters topologies which can mitigate and control all PQ problems. The combined algorithms of TSA-ANFIS are used to keep the dc-link voltage in UPQC at consistent level. The proposed hybrid approach is executed in MATLAB/Simulink platform and the performance is studied. Further, the proposed method is compared with existing Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO) technique and also with hybrid EHO-ANFIS techniques. The comparison results showed that the proposed technique is superior to the EHO and EHO-ANFIS techniques. © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Company."

Accordingly, this study examines the effects of cognitive rehabilitation on processing speed, response inhibition, attention, and Perceptual Reasoning in students with mathematics learning disabilities. Methods: This was a semi-experimental study with a pre-test-post-test design and a control group. The statistical population included all third-grade students with mathematics problems in Tehran City, Iran, in 2017. They were referred to Roozbeh Counseling and Rehabilitation Clinic for treatment and met the inclusion criteria. A total of 30 students were selected from among these individuals using the purposive sampling method. The participants were assigned to experimental (n=15) and control groups (n=15). The participants in the experimental group underwent a 20-session cognitive rehabilitation program. The Grant and Beck Wisconsin test (1948), the Wechsler intelligence test (2003), the fourth edition, the Sarrold continuous achievement test (1956), and the Toulouse-Piron attention test (1986) were used to collect data. The data were analyzed using the multivariate analysis of variance and the SPSS software, version 22. Results: Cognitive rehabilitation strategies effectively affect information processing speed, responsiveness, attention and perceptual reasoning in children with math learning disabilities (P<0.001). Furthermore, the results showed that learning cognitive rehabilitation strategies had a considerable impact on perceptual reasoning (P<0.001) according to the resulting Eta coefficient (η2=0.92). Discussion: Cognitive rehabilitation is a practical approach to improving information processing speed, reaction inhibition, attention, and Perceptual Reasoning skills in students with special mathematical learning disabilities.

This study proposes an incorporation of a bio-inspired limb-like structure (LLS)-based nonlinear damping into the motor suspension system for traction units to improve the nonlinear critical speed and hunting stability of high-speed trains (HSTs). Initially, a vibration transmission analysis is conducted on a HST vehicle and a metro vehicle that suffered from hunting motion to explore the effect of different motor suspension systems from on-track tests. Subsequently, a simplified lateral dynamics model of an HST bogie is established to investigate the influence of the motor suspension on the bogie hunting behavior. The bifurcation analysis is applied to optimize the motor suspension parameters for high critical speed. Then, the nonlinear damping of the bio-inspired LLS, which has a positive correlation with the relative displacement, can further improve the modal damping of hunting motion and nonlinear critical speed compared with the linear motor suspension system. Furthermore, a comprehensive numerical model of a high-speed train, considering all nonlinearities, is established to investigate the influence of different types of motor suspension. The simulation results are well consistent with the theoretical analysis. The benefits of employing nonlinear damping of the bio-inspired LLS into the motor suspension of HSTs to enhance bogie hunting stability are thoroughly validated. © The Author(s) 2024."

Based on engineering investigation, fuzzy mathematics and statistical analysis, this paper proposes a new method to evaluate the health state of highway tunnel structure, which considers the multi-disease characteristics and adaptive comprehensive weighting theory. Firstly, by investigating the health state of 20 operation highway tunnels in China, a tunnel disease database with 539 samples was constructed. Considering some new tunnel diseases such as floor heave and lining spalling, a health evaluation index system of highway tunnel was established further. Secondly, utilizing the subjective-objective weighting theory and the principle of variable weight, a new adaptive comprehensive weighting method was proposed to calculate the indexes’ weights. This method overcomes the defect that the constant weight cannot be dynamically updated according to the actual situation of disease development. Then, according to the established four-level classification standard suitable for health evaluation of highway tunnels, the normal distribution membership functions of second-level indexes were determined. Combining with the fuzzy theory, the quantitative evaluation model of tunnel health state was constructed further, which was applied to a case study of the Nanyangshan Tunnel of Kanglin Expressway in China. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with the traditional subjective-objective combination weighting method was conducted, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed evaluation method in terms of engineering applicability and result accuracy. The research findings can provide a decision-making basis for the health maintenance and scientific management of highway tunnels in China. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, a thorough review of the design and implementation of conventional and IVR conditions in media comparison studies has not been conducted to examine the extent to which specific affordances of IVR can be pinpointed as the causal factor in enhancing learning. The present review filled this gap in the literature by examining the degree to which conventional and IVR conditions have been controlled on instructional methods and content within the K-12 and higher education STEM literature base. Thirty-eight published journal articles, conference proceedings, and dissertations related to IVR comparison studies in STEM education between the years 2013 and 2022 were coded according to 15 categories. These categories allowed for the extraction of information on the instructional methods and content characteristics of the conventional and IVR conditions to determine the degree of control within each experimental comparison. Results indicated only 26% of all comparisons examined between an IVR and conventional condition were fully controlled on five key control criteria. Moreover, 40% of the comparisons had at least one confound related to instructional method and content. When looking at the outcomes of the studies, it was difficult to gather a clear picture of the benefits or pitfalls of IVR when much of the literature was confounded and/or lacked sufficient information to determine if the conditions were controlled on key variables. Implications and recommendations for future IVR comparison research are discussed. © The Author(s) 2024."

By employing the reductive perturbation method, we derive the Chen–Lee–Liu equation, thereby obtaining the nonlinear system in a planar form. Bifurcation analysis of the phase portraits is conducted to demonstrate the emergence of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits from the equilibrium points. These orbits serve as evidence that the nonlinear electrical network with neighbor couplings supports a diverse range of wave phenomena, including bright, dark, kink, and double-kink waves, as well as periodic waves. Furthermore, an external force is introduced to investigate the chaotic, quasi-periodic and time-dependent behaviors within the nonlinear system. It becomes evident that both the phase portraits and the time-dependent waveforms are highly responsive to variations in the amplitude of the external force. Finally, it is noteworthy that the Chen–Lee–Liu equation derived in the electrical network with neighbor couplings sheds light on dynamic behaviors reminiscent of those observed in models such as the helicoidal Peyrard–Bishop–Dauxois model of deoxyribonucleic acid and anharmonic lattices (Djine et al., 2023; Tchakoutio Nguetcho et al., 2017). © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The local and global stability analysis of the two subsystems, with and without harvesting, are studied. Furthermore, for the Filippov system, we have performed bifurcation analysis for several key parameters like predation rate, threshold quantity and prey refuge.

Previous research has shown that this model exhibits a large number of complex spatial and spatiotemporal aggregation patterns, as evidenced by numerical simulations and weakly nonlinear analysis. In this study, we focus on a particular type of localised patterns with odd/even/no symmetries (which are usually part of snaking solution branches with different symmetries that form complex bifurcation structures called snake-and-ladder bifurcations). To numerically investigate the bifurcating solution branches (to eventually construct the full bifurcating structures), we first need to understand the numerical issues that could appear when using different numerical schemes. To this end, in this study, we consider ten different numerical schemes (the upwind scheme, the MacCormack scheme, the Fractional-Step method, and the Quasi-Steady Wave-Propagation algorithm, combining them with high-resolution methods), while paying attention to the preservation of the solution symmetries with all these schemes. We show several numerical issues: first, we observe the presence of two distinct types of numerical solutions (with different symmetries) that exhibit very small errors, which might initially suggest that we have reached a steady-state solution, but this is not the case (this also implies an extremely slow convergence); second, in some cases, none of the investigated numerical schemes converge, posing a challenge for the development of numerical continuation algorithms for nonlocal hyperbolic systems; lastly, the choice of the numerical schemes, as well as their corresponding parameters such as time-space steps, exert a significant influence on the type and symmetry of bifurcating solutions. To conclude we emphasize that if we want to construct numerically bifurcation diagrams for these localised solutions with different symmetries, the resulting bifurcations may vary when different numerical schemes and/or corresponding parameters are employed. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The selected simulation area is the Sapinhoá field, located in the Santos Basin, Brazil, covering the age interval from 123 Ma to 113 Ma.

The presence of bifurcation structure can lead to the flow redistribution and distinctive characteristics. In the current study, a relational expression for the SMFR in branched tunnel was theoretically derived. A series of numerical simulations with Fire Dynamics Simulator(FDS) were conducted to investigate the effects of multiple factors on the smoke mass flow and validate the predictions. The results indicated that for a T-shaped tunnel, the amount of smoke flowing into the branch is mainly depends on the thickness and temperature of the incoming smoke flow from mainline, affecting by heat release rate(HRR) and tunnel section size, while the influence of the bifurcation angle and longitudinal position of fire source is unremarkable.

To accurately extract a priori clustering information, we use density peak clustering (DPC) rather than fuzzy c-means (FCM). The number and centres of resistivity and shear-wave velocity a priori clusters are extracted by DPC and then used to guide the joint inversion with the GFCM clustering coupling of ERT and ANSW data. Synthetic and field data are used to evaluate the flow and algorithm of DPC-GFCM clustering joint inversion. The results of synthetic examples show that the models recovered by the DPC-GFCM clustering joint inversion are nearly the same as the true models and are more accurate than those inverted using individual inversion and FCM-GFCM clustering joint inversion. In the field case, the depths of the stratigraphic interfaces shown in the resistivity and shear-wave velocity models inverted by DPC-GFCM clustering joint inversion are nearly consistent with those from the drilling data. In contrast, the strata recovered by the individual inversion and FCM-GFCM clustering joint inversion significantly differ from the drilling results. Both the synthetic and field examples verify the effectiveness of the DPC-GFCM clustering coupling method used for the joint inversion of ERT and ANSW data acquired from the near surface with strong heterogeneity.

To measure the structural entropy of a dynamic graph, we need to decode the optimal encoding tree corresponding to the best community partitioning for each snapshot. However, the current methods do not support dynamic encoding tree updating and incremental structural entropy computation. To address this issue, we propose Incre-2dSE, a novel incremental measurement framework that dynamically adjusts the community partitioning and efficiently computes the updated structural entropy for each updated graph. Specifically, Incre-2dSE includes incremental algorithms based on two dynamic adjustment strategies for two-dimensional encoding trees, i.e., the naive adjustment strategy and the node-shifting adjustment strategy, which support theoretical analysis of updated structural entropy and incrementally optimize community partitioning towards a lower structural entropy. We conduct extensive experiments on 3 artificial datasets generated by Hawkes Process and 3 real-world datasets. Experimental results confirm that our incremental algorithms effectively capture the dynamic evolution of the communities, reduce time consumption, and provide great interpretability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

However, a prevailing challenge in most existing ZSL approaches is their limited effectiveness in distinguishing similar unseen faults. This paper proposed a category-tree-guided hierarchical knowledge transfer zero-shot fault diagnosis (CTZSD) method, which is a coarse-to-fine zero-shot fault diagnosis framework to alleviate this problem. To embody the similarities between fault categories, the concept of fault category tree is proposed, for which a data-attribute collaborative tree construction mechanism (DATC) is designed. Rather than relying solely on semantic knowledge, DATC involves data, which carries richer information, to complement the category similarity evaluation. A hierarchical knowledge transfer zero-shot fault diagnosis mechanism (HKT) is subsequently developed, utilizing the established category tree to gradually narrow down the options, thereby promoting the recognition of similar unseen faults. The mechanism treats the diagnostic outcomes and model parameters from coarse-grained tasks as knowledge and transfers them to fine-grained tasks for guidance, realizing a coarse-to-fine diagnosis. Aiming at providing discriminative information to further distinguish similar unseen faults, attention modules are integrated within HKT. These modules assess attribute weight, thereby directing the model's focus toward the discriminative attributes of similar unseen faults. Experiments on a real TPP industrial process demonstrate that the proposed CTZSD outperforms other traditional ZSL methods in distinguishing similar unseen faults, improving the average accuracy by at least 19.7%. © 2024"

Results: Most postgraduate STEMM mentorship intervention studies lack strong evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, with only 5.5% of articles designed as randomized controlled trials. Most mentorship interventions (45.6%) were created for faculty, and few (4%) were for postdoctoral researchers. Also, only 18.8% of interventions focused on underrepresented groups in STEMM. Most interventions (53.7%) prescribed a dyadic structure, and there was more mentorship training for mentors than mentees.

Unlike previously reported reduced order models, which fail to capture realistic system behavior, such as chaos in healthy gears observed experimentally, this realistic model offers a more accurate representation. The proposed model is validated against experimental data and used to analyze the effect of varying tooth root crack depth as a bifurcation parameter, a novel investigation in this field. The proposed model incorporates major nonlinearities such as analytically improved time-varying mesh stiffness (AI-TVMS), backlash, static transmission error, and bearing clearances. The AI-TVMS model under healthy and varying crack depth scenarios is incorporated to analyze the nonlinear characteristics of the system. The analysis is presented via different tools such as bifurcation diagrams, phase portraits, Poincare maps, power spectral density, cepstrum analysis, envelope analysis, multifractal spectral analysis, Lyapunov exponents, and approximate entropy. The results demonstrate the chaotic nature of both healthy and defective gear systems. Additionally, the transient nature of the system at fault locations increased with the severity of % the crack depth, due to which the transient chaos phenomenon appeared for defective gear systems. Finally, the evaluation of tools attempts to distinguish between inherent nonlinearity and crack-induced nonlinearity.

In the field of path planning, the evaluation of planned trajectories is based on GPS data. However, due to the unstructured operating environment, the existing methods for evaluating the efficiency of actual operating trajectories are not yet fully developed. In the context of agricultural machinery GPS trajectories, headland turning of the field is considered a non-working segment, which related to evaluation standard for trajectory planning efficiency in many studies. This paper proposes a processing method that evaluates GPS trajectories efficiency. A turning extraction algorithm based on changes in the angle of the agricultural machine's driving direction is proposed. The turning parts of the raw GPS data are preliminarily extracted, and a method for constructing a turning extraction dataset is presented. Then a multi-layer perceptron model for straight-turn binary classification training using K-Fold cross validation is designed and applied, which can implement robust segmentation of agricultural machinery trajectory points in actual environment. Two methods for building different turning classification datasets are proposed, and turning classification is performed using two deep learning models. A convolutional neural network-based model classifies headland turnings by their normalized sequences’ visualization images, while a long short-term memory network-based model utilizes the trajectory point sequences. The CNN-based model performs relatively better than the LSTM-based model. Finally, some commonly used GPS trajectory efficiency evaluation standards in the field of agricultural machinery path planning are combined to evaluate the efficiency of actual GPS trajectories of agricultural machinery. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

This paper is devoted to further refining the fast–slow dynamics of the slowly forced Duffing system with another commonly encountered frequency switching scheme, i.e., the ascending frequency switching, characterized by switching the frequency synchronously according to the increase or decrease of state variable values. Taking the forcing amplitude as an example, this paper provides a theoretical way to fully summarize the fast–slow behaviors in frequency switching systems with the variation of parameter values based on the proposed superposition analysis of one- and two-parameter bifurcations of subsystems. As a result, two typical bifurcation structures and eight threshold windows with distinct switching vector fields therein are identified, inducing up to ten different bursting patterns.

In particular, the underlying mechanism of threshold modulation, i.e., the evolution of unconventional bifurcations, is also found. These findings contribute to complementing and contrasting the existing studies on the fast–slow dynamics of frequency switching systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, there is little rigorous work that analyses the enablers that promote AI–HI integration and application in the HSC. Thus, this paper reports a hybrid decision support framework for analysing enablers of AI–HI integration in the HSC with complicated, uncertain, and periodic information. First, to collect interdependent preference data from experts, the complex spherical fuzzy weighted Heronian mean operator with a weighted distance measures-based optimization model is established to generate a group decision matrix. Next, to measure the influence strength of enablers, a complex spherical fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation method is established to determine enabler weights, taking into account their interactive relationships. After that, to explore the enabler level of AI–HI integration in different participants of the HSC, the complex spherical fuzzy measurement of alternatives and ranking according to the compromise solution method is developed by combining the former two procedures. Finally, a case study of enablers analysis for AI–HI integration in HSC is presented to assess the feasibility of the current method, which includes sensitivity and comparison studies. The results reveal that the factor “enhancing the efficiency of relief operations” (0.084) is the most important driving factor for AI–HI integration. The outcomes of this study can provide a new decision support method for understanding the enablers of AI–HI integration in key parts of the HSC. © 2024 The Author(s)"

To elucidate these behaviors, the basic properties, including equilibrium points and symmetry, of a Shinriki circuit incorporating a grounded asymmetric diode-bridge-based memristor are first illustrated. The discretization scheme for the circuit is established through the implicit mapping method, and the relatively complete bifurcation trees of each periodic motion by tuning a variable resistor can be analyzed through the Newton-Raphson algorithm. The unique unstable periodic bifurcation routes are also revealed. The evolution of antimonotonicity triggered by period-doubling or saddle-node bifurcations, along with the formed unstable motions, are comprehensively discussed. Furthermore, the simulation results are verified via a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), by which both the asymmetric stable and unstable coexisting periodic attractors can be captured. The results will contribute to explaining the dynamical behaviors of numerous memristive circuits from a novel semi-analytical way, thus opening the possibility of analyzing some phenomena, such as unstable bifurcation routes, that cannot be directly observed via the numerical method. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

First, we analyze the dynamical behaviors of the HVDRS without the low-frequency amplitude-modulated excitation, and only one bursting mode named symmetric compound “fold/supHopf-fold/supHopf” bursting oscillation with two PSEs can be observed. By regarding the slowly time-varying cosine harmonic function as a generalized slow parameter, we find that the amplitude-modulated excitation can significantly influence the equilibrium curve characteristics and bursting oscillations types. Two excited harmonic oscillations can be identified by combining the phase portraits on the (δ, x) space with bifurcation diagrams. The first is asymmetric compound bursting oscillations when the coupling factor n is equal the odd numbers, and we note that the bursting structures become increasingly complex as n increases. The second is compound bursting oscillations with respect to the origin symmetry when the coupling factor n is equal the even numbers. We point out that the generation of the asymmetric and symmetric bursting oscillations are mainly caused by the bifurcation structures and bifurcation delay effect. The validities of the conclusions are verified by numerical simulations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Understanding the key factors influencing forest fire dynamics is essential for effective management and mitigation. This study aims to comprehensively analyze forest fire risk patterns in Djebel El Ouahch's massif (Algeria), focusing on integrating bioclimatic, fuel, geomorphological, and human factors through advanced fuzzy logic and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. Climatic station data, satellite imagery, and GIS were employed to map bioclimatic parameters, land cover, and geomorphological features. Fuzzy logic systems were applied to integrate these factors, assigning appropriate weights based on their significance. The resulting forest fire prediction model was defuzzified to generate predictive maps indicating varying vulnerability levels within the study area. Predictive maps delineated areas of low to high forest fire risk. Low-risk zones were characterized by sparse vegetation, while high-risk regions featured densely vegetated slopes near human settlements. The study identified critical factors influencing vulnerability, emphasizing the impact of climate, terrain, and human activities. Urgent attention was directed toward high-risk areas, necessitating tailored fire prevention measures and strategic urban planning to minimize human-induced risks. The results underscored the complex interaction of natural and anthropogenic factors in shaping forest fire susceptibility. Understanding these dynamics facilitates evidence-based policymaking, enhancing forest fire preparedness, biodiversity preservation, and community safety. Additionally, the study emphasized the need for continuous research incorporating real-time climate data and socio-economic factors to refine predictive models. This research provided valuable insights into forest fire risk patterns in Djebel El Ouahch, serving as a foundation for targeted fire management strategies. By bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, this study contributes significantly to sustainable forest management and disaster mitigation efforts globally, emphasizing the importance of proactive measures in safeguarding vulnerable ecosystems and communities. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Triangular stochastic simulation (TSS) possesses certain advantages in solving uncertainty problems, but its inadequacy with discrete data reveals limitations in this aspect. To solve the above problems, this study proposes to construct trapezoidal fuzzy number-Monte Carlo stochastic simulation (TFN-MCSS) to compensate for the shortcomings of the first two methods. This method adopted trapezoidal fuzzy number (TFN) analysis to comprehensively consider the characteristics of a large dispersion of water quality monitoring data and the uncertainty of the human health risk assessment (HHRA) process. Concurrently, to overcome the subjectivity and uncertainty of artificially determining the interval of TFN in traditional methods, the slope was used to select the most probable interval value (TMPIV) of TFN combined with the α-truncated set technique (α-TST) and MCSS. Based on these, a TFN-MCSS was constructed and applied to groundwater HHRA in western Jilin Province. First, the groundwater chemical characteristic determination and water quality evaluation in western Jilin were performed to identify the main pollution indicators, and the health risk effects of pollutants in groundwater of different aquifers at different time periods on adults and children were evaluated using the TFN-MCSS. The uncertainty and sensitivity were analyzed, and the primary risk control indicators were identified and compared to FSM and TSS. The results reveal that TFN-MCSS was more sensitive to data and could reduce the uncertainty of assessment process. It indicated that over a 10-year period, the health risks associated with unconfined groundwater (UW) and confined water (CW) decreased by greater than 52 %. However, the highest total non-carcinogenic risk index (THI) was 1.3-fold higher than the safety threshold, and this posed a health risk. © 2024 The Authors"

Previous works have illustrated the persistent coexistence of high-energy and low-energy responses. Jumps among the responses can be induced by unavoidable initial-condition disturbances of TPEHs in practice, which concerns the final output of the harvested energy. For a more accurate evaluation of the TPEH performance, the disturbances of initial conditions should be taken into account. This study focuses on global dynamics of a typical TPEH with two fixed external magnets. Via static bifurcation analysis of the TPEH oscillatory system, the separation and gap distances are identified as key parameters to configure triple potential wells. The primary resonance analysis of the intra-well and inter-well responses is carried out to determine the optimum separation distance for efficient energy harvesting. Then, sequences of attractors and their basins of attraction (BAs) with the rise in the ambient excitation level and frequency is illustrated, showing that initial conditions of the TPEH system perturbed within the central well are beneficial for energy harvesting. For a low-level base excitation, BAs outside of the triple wells are severely fractal where the perturbation of the initial state of the TPEH can easily induce a jump that implies the unreliability of the TPEH performance. At a much higher ambient excitation level, the high-energy inter-well response can be globally attractive and reliable, which is preferable for practical applications of energy harvesters. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Prior research predominantly follows a variable-centred approach to investigate students’ emotions while person-centred analyses are still scarce. Based on a representative sample of N = 11 131 Swiss students in grade 9, this cross-sectional large-scale study investigates how four trait mathematics emotions (enjoyment, anger, anxiety and boredom) are related to students’ perception of mathematics instruction quality (cognitive activation, lack of classroom management, teacher support) and their mathematics test achievement. Results from structural equation modelling (variable-centred approach) revealed that enjoyment and all three negative emotions are related to two dimensions of instructional quality: cognitive activation and lack of classroom management. Association of emotions with teacher support differed, as associations were not confirmed for enjoyment and anxiety. Enjoyment was not related to achievement, whereas boredom showed positive associations. The results from mediation analyses suggest that the direct associations of perceived cognitive activation and perceived lack of classroom management with mathematics achievement are stronger compared to the indirect associations mediated by student emotions. Latent profile analysis identified four profiles: happy, unhappy, bored, and ambivalent. Students in the happy profile had the highest perception of instructional quality and outperformed the other profiles. Results are discussed in relation to the added value of a person-centred approach to better understand students’ emotions in mathematics education. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

In this study, we use the construct of critical incident as a tool to support prospective mathematics teachers’ reflection on their authentic fieldwork activities, notice students’ thinking, and link it to the complexity of mathematics teaching. Particularly, we aim to explore the characteristics and evolution of prospective mathematics teachers’ noticing of students’ mathematical thinking when critical incidents trigger reflective discussions. Critical incidents are moments in which students’ mathematical thinking becomes apparent and can provide teachers with opportunities to delve more deeply into the mathematics discussed in the lesson. In the study, twenty-two prospective mathematics teachers participated in fieldwork activities that included observing and teaching secondary school classrooms. The prospective teachers identified critical incidents from their observations and teaching, which were the foci for reflective discussion in university sessions. By characterizing the prospective teachers’ reflective talk in these discussions, we demonstrate the discussion’s evolution. In it, participants questioned learning and teaching mathematics and suggested alternate explanations. This characterization also shows that using critical incidents in the university discussions enabled the prospective teachers to link students’ thinking with the teacher’s teaching practices while supporting their reflection using classroom evidence. We emphasize the importance of descriptive talk in the discussion, which allows for deepening the prospective teachers’ reflections. Further, we explore the teacher educator’s contributions in those discussions, showing that the teacher educator mainly maintained the reflective talk by contextualizing the critical incidents and pressing the participants to explain further issues they raised in the discussions.

Electroactive PVC gel is a composite material that mimics the response of natural muscles, making it highly advantageous for various bionic mechanical applications. The existing literature primarily focuses on enhancing the performance and exploring applications of PVC gel, with particular emphasis on optimizing its ability to simulate muscle deformation. However, the existing literature lacks research on the theoretical mechanism and modeling of large deformation, particularly regarding the investigation of nonlinear dynamic behavior under state-varying electromechanical parameters. The present research establishes a novel theoretical model for PVC gel and investigates its dynamic response to voltage, mechanical force, and inertia force. Firstly, the electromechanical constitutive model of PVC gel actuator was elucidated, and the nonlinear dynamics control equation of PVC gel actuator was established based on the Gent model. Secondly, we investigate the vibration characteristics of PVC gel material by analyzing four key parameters: size, tensile strength, applied voltage amplitude, and excitation frequency. Through this analysis, we determine the relevant parameters and operational range of the PVC gel actuator when subjected to voltage excitation. Meanwhile, the phase trajectories and Poincaré maps were generated based on the control equation calculation results to investigate the vibration stability and chaotic characteristics of the PVC gel actuator under electromechanical coupling conditions. The deformation of PVC gel is influenced by various nonlinear factors, wherein the alteration in frequency induces harmonic, subharmonic, and super-harmonic resonance phenomena within the frequency response. By revising the size, voltage, and frequency of these three factors, with particular emphasis on regulating the frequency, chaotic behavior in the PVC gel will be facilitated. Finally, the bifurcation analysis of the electromechanical vibration behavior of the PVC gel actuator was carried out, and the stability of the PVC gel vibration was further quantitatively determined by the Lyapunov exponent. © 2024"

In the research project a series of 14 short mathematical challenges were designed and delivered in a WhatsApp group used as a communication and documentation tool with the participating families. Videos recorded by them were subsequently analyzed with the purpose of describing and analyzing: (a) the experience children live in contact with informal situations underlying the concepts of number and shape and (b) the engagement of families. The choice of these informal situations is based upon recent research that shows the need to consider the wide range of occasional experiences with mathematical ideas children have in their family prior to schooling. In order to design productive mathematical activities we drew on our past research for the choosing of crucial mathematical issues (whole numbers, plane geometry, and solids). We discuss the evolution in parents from practical help to deep engagement, and the fact that notwithstanding diversity in family contexts, engagement and an especially joyful approach to mathematics emerged. The use of videos opens up a path to the possibility to online learning for children with Down syndrome. © 2024 The Author(s).

The cavity-dumped Q-switched laser has emerged as the preferred scheme for producing shorter pulse output at a high repetition rate in these lasers. In this manuscript, the entire evolution process of the cavity-dumped pulsed chaotic dynamical system is revealed using the equilibrium theory between depletion and restoration of population inversion and the numerical iteration method. The entire path goes through several stages, including the steady-state operation stage, period-doubling bifurcations stage, period windows stage, deterministic chaos stage, inverse period-doubling bifurcations stage, and finally stable state again. The output characteristics of the cavity-dumped laser system were determined experimentally at various stages. Using one-dimensional discrete-time dynamical system theory, the boundaries between stable and unstable pulses have been identified, demonstrating the effectiveness of multiple parameter regulation for controllable single-cycle steady-state operation. Finally, laser pulses with a FWHM of 2.78 ns at a repetition rate of 50 kHz are generated, and it is also the shortest pulse duration achieved with a cavity-dumped Q-switched linear laser cavity structure. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, there is still no generally accepted approach for site selection and oftentimes authorities rely on empirical insights instead of systematic design. In this study, we integrated geoprocessing tools with a Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP), coupled with a thorough sensitivity analysis (SA) to determine the optimal sites for a WQMN automatic stations. The proposed model is based on the combination of seven criteria, representing anthropogenic stressors and environmental status to identify high-priority sub-basins (“hot-spots”), in geographic information system (GIS). The results propose that “hot-spots” appear in clusters and are unevenly distributed over the study area. They encompass the biggest cities and their surroundings as well as the estuaries of the three main rivers. Moreover, the model identified monitoring “hot-spots” that occupy only small extents of the study area and could otherwise be undetected. Complementing the model, a SA was performed over the -50% to + 50% range of criteria weights, to evaluate the stability of the results and robustness of the model. The criteria with the highest weight values in base scenario were determined as the most impactful. Furthermore, sub-basins that contain features from only one criterion proved to be greatly susceptible to ranking changes during the SA. The GIS-based F-AHP method, paired with SA, proved to be a reliable and cost-effective tool, that does not rely on hydrologic data, making it a suitable approach even for ungauged basins. Highlights: • A GIS-based FAHP to identify “hot-spots” for designing a water monitoring network. • High-priority sub-basins appear in clusters, unevenly distributed over the study area. • Thorough sensitivity analysis was implemented to support robustness of the model. • Sensitivity analysis identified the more susceptible to ranking variations sub-basins. • Highest weight criteria proved to be the most impactful during sensitivity analysis. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

A vast amount of business data and private data are continuously uploaded to the cloud platform, driven by a series of attractive services offered by the cloud. Unfortunately, once data is uploaded to the cloud, its owner has no way of ensuring that it is actually deleted as intended. This obviously increases the concerns of data owners about the security of their data, because it is related to the privacy of users. Therefore, there must be a reliable solution to prove that data is deleted as requested by users, to prevent data leakage or abuse. In existing data deletion schemes, most are designed based on cryptographic knowledge rather than erasure or overwrite techniques, in order not to cause incalculable damage to the storage medium. However, most cryptographic-based data deletion schemes, particularly attribute-based encryption, involve numerous complex bilinear mapping operations, which are expensive for most devices. To address this issue, the paper proposes an Efficient and Verifiable Scheme for Secure Data Deletion (EVSD). Firstly, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is introduced to achieve efficient encryption of data. Then, leveraging Linear Secret Sharing Scheme (LSSS), fine-grained data deletion policies supporting logical operations are implemented. Finally, the deletion of the data is efficiently verified using the root of the Merkle Hash Tree (MHT) generated by the defined illegal and legal attributes, while the deletion proof is also generated. Satisfactorily, security analysis shows that the EVSD scheme is much more advantageous compared to existing schemes, and a trait likewise is also observed in the performance evaluation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, developing a computational toolbox with high interpretability to unveil the interaction dynamics from data remains a crucial challenge. Here, we propose a new computational approach called automated dynamical model inference based on expression trees (ADMIET), in which the machine learning algorithm, the numerical integration of ordinary differential equations and the interpretability from prior knowledge are embedded into the symbolic learning scheme to establish a general framework for revealing the hidden dynamics in time-series data. ADMIET takes full advantage of both machine learning algorithm and expression tree. Firstly, we translate the prior knowledge into constraints on the structure of expression tree, reducing the search space and enhancing the interpretability. Secondly, we utilize the proposed adaptive penalty function to ensure the convergence of gradient descent algorithm and the selection of the symbols. Compared to gene expression programming, ADMIET exhibits its remarkable capability in function fitting with higher accuracy and broader applicability. Moreover, ADMIET can better fit parameters in nonlinear forms compared to regression methods. Furthermore, we apply ADMIET to two typical biological systems and one real data with different prior knowledge to infer the dynamical equations. The results indicate that ADMIET can not only discover the interaction relationships but also provide accurate estimates of the parameters in the equations. These results demonstrate ADMIET’s superiority in revealing interpretable dynamics from time-series biological data. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd."

We cast these considerations in a model of human–human and human–machine alignment and sketch basic alignment strategies based on these categories and further reflections on rule-following like the notion of meaning as use. To sustain the validity of these considerations, we also show that successful techniques employed by AI safety researchers to better align new AI systems with our human goals are congruent with the stipulations that we derive from the later Wittgenstein’s philosophy. However, their application may benefit from the added specificities and stipulations of our framework: it extends on the current efforts and provides further, specific AI alignment techniques. Thus, we argue that the categories of the model and the core alignment strategies presented in this work can inform further AI alignment techniques. © The Author(s) 2024."

Efforts to confront this diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) challenge, such as faculty adoption of evidenced-based instructional approaches that promote student success, have been slow. Instructional and pedagogical change efforts at the academic department level have been demonstrated to be effective at enacting reform. One potential strategy is to embed change agent individuals within STEM departments that can drive change efforts. This study seeks to assess whether tenure-track, teaching-focused faculty housed in STEM departments are perceived as influential on the instructional and pedagogical domains of their colleagues. To answer this, individuals across five STEM departments at large, research-intensive campuses identified faculty who were influential upon six domains of their instruction and pedagogy. Social network analysis of individuals in these departments revealed heterogeneity across the instructional domains. Some, like the teaching strategies network, are highly connected and involve the majority of the department; while others, like the DEI influence network, comprise a significantly smaller population of faculty. Importantly, we demonstrate that tenure-track, teaching-focused faculty are influential across all domains of instruction, but are disproportionately so in the sparsely populated DEI influence networks."

The PDDNLS is a universal model to describe parametrically driven systems. In particular, we have characterized stationary Faraday patterns, periodic, quasi-periodic, and spatiotemporal chaos as a function of the amplitude and the frequency of the parametric driving force. We have computed the Lyapunov spectra, the Fourier spectra, the amplitude norm, and the Kaplan–Yorke dimensions as valuable indicators for the identification of several dynamical regimes. We show that in the Faraday regime, close to the bifurcation of the trivial state, the pattern amplitude scales with power one-fourth (1/4) of the bifurcation parameter. Furthermore, we have found that the pattern wavelength decreases when the detuning parameter increases. In the case of the high dimensional spatiotemporal chaotic states, we have found that the Kaplan–Yorke dimension increases linearly with the length of the system, showing its extensive character in this dynamical regime. We have also found a transition from low to high dimensional chaos when the forcing amplitude is increased. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, findings from these investigations vary significantly and occasionally contradict each other. This study delves into this connection by analyzing variables or dimensions from three distinct models of national culture concerning the results of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the economic strength and growth of 86 nations between 2000 and 2018. Religious affiliations emerge as a significant statistical explanatory factor, accounting for a substantial portion of the variance in overall PISA performance, ranging from 24% to 40%. Remarkably, an underutilized cultural model, the Axiological Cube, surpasses others, exhibiting explanatory power ranging from 45% to 63%. Path analyses rooted in both Human Capital Theory and Cognitive Capitalism Theory reveal that cultural variables exert their influence on economic growth mainly indirectly through their impact on student competence. Cultural variables exhibit robust predictive capacity for overall student competences, as indicated by PISA mean scores. However, they prove inadequate in explaining certain cognitive competence patterns, such as disparities in inequality and subject-specific variations, like mathematics and reading.

The purpose of this study was to investigate originality in the solving of mathematical problems in K-6 students. Guided by this purpose, we investigated to what extent scores on accuracy, fluency, and application of concepts predict originality in producing solutions to mathematical problems. The participants included 520 K-6 students who attended a public elementary school which was located in a multicultural metropolitan area of New South Wales, Australia. The DISCOVER Mathematics Assessment was used to assess the students’ problem solving skills. To answer our research question, we conducted binary logistic regression analysis to predict the relationship between the independent variables (accuracy, fluency, and application of concepts) and the predicted binary variable (originality in solutions to mathematical problems). The logistic regression model was statistically significant and explained 11.6% of the variance in producing original solutions and classified 91.3 % of cases correctly. The results of the binary logistic regression analysis showed that increases in accuracy and application of concept scores were associated with an increase in the odds of being able to produce original solutions in mathematical problem solving. Unlike accuracy and application of concepts, a change in fluency scores was not significantly associated with a change in the odds of being able to produce original solutions in mathematical problem solving. The findings of this domain specific research on originality provided insights for the notion of creativity in mathematical problem solving among K-6 students. We discussed the implications of our findings as well as our recommendations for research, practice and policy to develop students’ creative potential. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

In this paper, we propose a stateful black-box encryption protocol fuzzing method to analyze the security of real-world black-box encryption protocol programs and devices. This method does not rely on the source code but uses captured packets as input, performs state selection based on a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm, and processes the encryption/decryption conversion of mutant test cases based on the intermediate mapper. It sends test cases and collects responses in interactive communication with the tested program and dynamically optimizes the corpus based on the collected state information. Based on this method, we develop SBEPFuzz and primarily analyze IPsec. We evaluate SBEPFuzz on six widely used IPsec implementations. The experimental results show that SBEPFuzz achieves higher code coverage, and can discover more protocol state sequences and vulnerabilities.

This paper analyzes results of the outdoor experiment conducted at the Faculty of Sciences and Mathematics in Niš investigating the influence of deposited fly ash on power (P) drop for horizontally and optimally inclined PV panels during three heating seasons in the City of Niš. Innovations of the paper are reflected in concrete data of P drop for short time periods in real outdoor environment, additionally connected with precipitation values which represent natural way of panels cleaning, that are all together not frequent in available literature especially for continental climate regions. The experiment showed that for only one day without precipitation, the P drop for the horizontal panel rose by an extra 0.4–10 %, and 0.2–9.1 % for the optimal panel. Experimentally measured data in this paper are of high importance not only for showing the P loss of PV panels in soiling conditions and the necessity of periodical cleaning, but also for their utilization in urban PV plants design and further simulations and calculations. © 2024"

In order to automatically switch energy utilization modes based on current parameters to reduce energy consumption, this paper developed a fuzzy control system for a kelp multi-energy drying device. An automatic switching strategy between different operating modes and the action processes of various actuators were established for matching multiple energy sources. The system hardware and software were designed and installed, including a remote monitoring devices and human-machine interface. Drying experiments of kelp were conducted in solar, solar-heat pump, heat pump and Heat storage-heat pump mode using both the fuzzy control system and the original. The fuzzy control system showed a temperature overshoot of 2.57 %–3.95 %, temperature deviation within ±1.5 °C, which were superior to the original control system. The energy consumption in solar-heat pump mode was 0.398 kW h/kg, only 43 % of the original control system.

Besides, we consider that severe and asymptomatic cases may present relapse between them. Transmission dynamics driven by the contact rates only occurs when a parameter R∗>1, as normally occur in directly-transmitted or vector-transmitted diseases, but it will not adequately correspond to a basic reproductive number as it depends on environmental parameters. In this case, the forward transcritical bifurcation that exists for R∗<1, becomes a backward bifurcation, producing multiple steady-states, a hysteresis effect and dependence on initial conditions. A threshold parameter for an epidemic outbreak, independent of R∗ is only the ratio of the external contamination inflow shedding rate to the environmental clearance rate. R∗ describes the strength of the transmission to infectious classes other than the I-(acute) type infections.

The Symbiogenic mechanism for assimilation of factors in the environment formulates the continuum from inside the cell to the Cosmos, both consciousness and cosmology complying with the Laws of Nature. Since Symbiogenesis is ‘constructive’, whereas eliminating what threatens us is ‘destructive’, why do we largely practice Symbiogenesis? Hypothetically, Symbiogenesis recursively simulates the monism of our origin, recognizing ‘something bigger than ourselves’. That perspective explains many heretofore unexplained aspects of consciousness, such as mind, epigenetic inheritance, physiology, behaviors, social systems, mathematics, the Arts, from an a priori perspective. Moreover, there is an energetic continuum from Newtonian to Quantum Mechanics, opening up to a novel way of understanding the ‘true nature of our being’, not as ‘materialism’, but instead being the serial homeostatic control of energy. The latter is consistent with the spirit of Claude Bernard and Walter B. Cannon's perspectives on physiology. Such a paradigm shift is overdue, given that materialism is causing the destruction of the Earth and ourselves. © 2024"

Use Simulink to model HODO to display different phase trajectories. Secondly, the fractional-order high-order Duffing oscillator (FOHODO) is studied, and the results exhibit its nonlinear characteristics that differ from HODO. Then, the critical state of the fractional-order high-order Duffing coupled Van der Pol oscillator (FOHOD-VPO) is studied, and it is successfully applied to detect the multi-line spectrum periodic signals and ship-radiated noise (S-RN). Finally, in the performance analysis, the input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold of the HODO is lower, which is −33.47 dB. The performance of the FOHOD-VPO considering the coupling factor and fractional derivative is better than that of the HODO. The input SNR threshold of the FOHOD-VPO is −70.97 dB.

In education, a central tenet of the theory is that experiencing autonomous motivation in school activities (i.e., genuine pleasure and enjoyment) fosters optimal learning processes, whereas experiencing controlled motivation (i.e., pressure from social or instrumental incentives) undermines them. Although the theory is well established empirically, little is known about how these motivations combine in their effects on achievement at school (interactions), and whether their effects depend on the intensity of motivations (nonlinearities) or on the context of study (national differences). Applying cubic response surface analysis to the TIMSS 2019 dataset on mathematics (N = 152,825 8th grade students from 37 countries), as well as replication data (N = 169,269 8th grade students from TIMSS 2015, N = 270 college students from SDT data), this study uncovers the existence of various kinds of nonlinear-interactive motivational processes in achievement, three of which systematically account for cross-national differences. In substance, these findings demonstrate that predictions based on SDT are close to universally true (93% of students), although they may not generalize well to extreme states of autonomous or controlled motivation (nonlinear and interactive processes). Implications for research and interventions on motivational processes are discussed. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Semantic labeling is often necessary to extract information from the raw point cloud. Deep learning methods constitute a data-hungry solution for the semantic segmentation of point clouds. In this work, we investigate the use of simulated laser scanning for training deep learning models, which are applied to real data subsequently. We show that training a deep learning model purely on virtual laser scanning data can produce results comparable to models trained on real data when evaluated on real data. For leaf-wood segmentation of trees, using the KPConv model trained with virtual data achieves 93.7% overall accuracy, while the model trained on real data reaches 94.7% overall accuracy. In urban contexts, a KPConv model trained on virtual data achieves 74.1% overall accuracy on real validation data, while the model trained on real data achieves 82.4%. Our models outperform the state-of-the-art model FSCT in terms of generalization to unseen real data as well as a baseline model trained on points randomly sampled from the tree mesh surface. From our results, we conclude that the combination of laser scanning simulation and deep learning is a cost-effective alternative to real data acquisition and manual labeling in the domain of geospatial point cloud analysis. The strengths of this approach are that (a) a large amount of diverse laser scanning training data can be generated quickly and without the need for expensive equipment, (b) the simulation configurations can be adapted so that the virtual training data have similar characteristics to the targeted real data, and (c) the whole workflow can be automated through procedural scene generation. © 2024 The Authors"

A variable coefficient third-order nonlinear Schrödinger’s equation (PNLSE) with truncated M-fractional derivative is considered. We also discuss a few assets that the derivative satisfies. Initially, a novel evaluation method known as bifurcation analysis is employed to look at the complex model's dynamic behavior. Figure 1 provides an analytical and graphical study of the observed mechanism of static soliton through a saddle-node bifurcation in the nonlinear Schrödinger problem using a matching technique. Secondly, By implementing novel two analytic techniques such as unified solver and generalized unified techniques to offer insights into wave propagation and optical soliton conduct in nonlinear optics, optical communications, quantum mechanics, plasma physics, and engineering. The underlying idea of these two approaches is to transform the equation with partial derivatives into a version of the equation with ordinary derivatives, which are first required to incorporate a new wave definition. These techniques permit us to generate innovative soliton solutions that can be formulated in terms of rational, hyperbolic, and trigonometrical functions. The collected outcomes have the potential to facilitate an understanding and elucidation of the physical characteristics of waves moving within a dispersive substance. We additionally estimated conservative values related to solitons, such as energy, momentum, and power. By selecting appropriate parameter values, the graphical shapes in 3D, density, and 2D are generated using relevant parameter values to visually present the obtained results, including periodic wave soliton, interaction of kink and bell shape soliton, periodic breather wave soliton, double periodic soliton through unified solver method and interaction of kink and periodic lump wave soliton and also with the periodic soliton, double periodic wave soliton, periodic wave soliton with lump soliton, multi periodic wave with kink shape soliton, periodic wave soliton, periodic breather wave soliton, periodic wave soliton, multi periodic wave soliton, periodic lump wave soliton, breather wave soliton multi periodic wave through generalized unified technique, providing an insightful visualization of the discovered solutions. In a two-dimensional graph, we show the effect of truncated M-fractional parameters for [g=0.1,0.5,0.9]. Additionally, the modulation instability spectrum can be expressed utilizing a linear analysis technique, and the modulation instability bands are shown to be influenced by the third-order and group velocity dispersion. The findings indicate that the modulation instability disappears for negative values of the fourth order in a typical dispersion regime. Consequently, it was shown that the techniques mentioned previously could be an effective tool to generate unique, precise soliton solutions for numerous uses, which are crucial to nonlinear optics, optical communications, and engineering. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024."

Identifying such strategies specifically for campuses is urgently needed to tackle the adverse impacts of unsustainable transportation practices on carbon emissions, local air quality, campus health, and institutional budgets while promoting a culture of sustainability among university communities. To address this, a set of strategies, including 23 sub-strategies and 8 main strategies, along with 6 evaluation criteria, was determined following extensive research. Thus, the present study aims to select and prioritize the strategies of sustainable transportation within the campus environment by proposing a novel hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method, integrating Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) under Picture fuzzy sets. This research also carried out sensitivity and comparative analyses to confirm the consistency and reliability of the results produced by the proposed hybrid method. The results indicate that short-term strategies, such as providing facilities for bike riders and reorganizing campus parking, ranked highest due to their immediate feasibility and cost-effectiveness. Conversely, strategies related to remote and flexible work options or affordable housing, which require a longer implementation process, and significant investment, ranked lower in the final rankings. Policy-makers, stakeholders, and campus administrators will gain useful insights from this research, which not only provides a holistic perspective on sustainable transportation planning within educational settings but also proposes a novel methodology, bridging the knowledge gap in the existing literature. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Specifically, we introduce the necessary conditions to ensure the occurrence of the bistability phenomenon within a parametric family of bimodal maps, based on the difference map. The bimodal map is defined within a regular partition consisting of two subintervals, and we present three case studies: the first case corresponds to keeping the value of the first modal fixed, while the second modal changes its value according to a parameter. In the second case, the value assigned to the first modal changes according to another parameter while the value of the second modal remains fixed. In the third case, both values assigned to the modals change according to a bifurcation parameter. Bifurcation diagrams are shown for the three case studies and let us identify invariant sets or trapping regions in each subinterval. Subsequently, two invariant sets are defined to enable the bistability phenomenon. Therefore, monostability and bistability phenomena appear in parametric families according to the control of invariant sets and trapping regions by varying a bifurcation parameter. The numerical results align with the developed theory. We show an application of the family of bimodal maps to generate a reconfigurable multivibrator-classified as astable, bistable and monostable. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

In light of this, the simultaneous optimization of these two objectives within the port integrated scheduling of quay cranes, internal vehicles, and yard cranes, can aid in sustaining port development in the era of digitalization and autonomy. Furthermore, given the persistent fluctuations in uncertain operation time of the cranes and vehicles in port, it becomes imperative to consider the robustness of their scheduling plans collectively. This paper therefore aims to develop a new tri-objective mixed-integer programming model for the first time that enables the incorporation of operational uncertainty and energy efficiency into the context of port operation scheduling consideration. The three objectives are makespan, energy consumption, and scheduling plan robustness, which is represented by anti-cascade and robustness evaluation indices. To effectively address complex optimization challenges, a novel multi-objective solution algorithm has been developed, featured with a dynamic fitness evaluation method selection mechanism. This mechanism utilizes a new crowding distance operator based on the cosine distance of objective value vectors to enhance population diversity in the early stages of the algorithm's iterations. At the later stages, it employs a fuzzy correlation entropy operator to ensure rapid convergence and high-quality solutions. Comparative experiments conducted in scenarios involving emerging technologies such as U-shaped ports and double-cycling operational mode demonstrate the evident improvements achieved by the new model in terms of makespan, energy consumption, and computational efficiency. Based on the compelling experimental results, meaningful insights and implications are put forward, including the potential time and energy savings in port operations, and the practical applicability of these models and algorithms in both port and various other industries. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Urmia Lake, the largest inland lake of Iran has lost most of its water over the past 2 decades. The lake bed is known as one of the aerosol pollution sources in the northwestern Iran. Although recent studies contributed to investigate the impacts of the drying up of Urmia Lake on the local and regional air quality, there is still a need to identify spatiotemporal aerosol pollution and dust generation sources in the study area. In this study, remote sensing techniques, fuzzy logic and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were used to identify dust hot spots in the south and east parts of the Lake, where recent studies have highlighted the dramatic extent of salinization and desertification. Based on the results of this study, the lake's contribution to the local aerosol pollution declines with increasing distance from it. The results indicated that the potential of dust forming on the east side of the lake has increased, presenting a variety of challenges for inhabitants, including health and biological hazards. The fuzzy results have a high correlation with Electrical Conductivity (EC) (0.69), Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) (0.46), and Leaf Area Index (0.45), respectively, while wind speed (0.22) and slope (0.24) have the lower correlation. The results of PCA indicate that AOD, Digital Elevation Model, and EC have the highest percentage in identifying dust generation sources among the effective parameters in determining dust production sources. © Indian Society of Remote Sensing 2024."

This paper considers the scenario where an armature wall acts on one side of an axially moving ferromagnetic thin plate and investigates the multiple resonance of the plate subjected to a harmonic excitation in the air-gap magnetic field. First, based on electromagnetic theory combined with boundary conditions of the magnetic field, the distribution of the air-gap magnetic field is determined by solving the Laplace equation of the magnetic scalar potential function. Next, expressions for the magnetic and Lorentz forces acting on the moving ferromagnetic plate are derived. Then, the thin plate energy expression considering geometric nonlinearity and the virtual work expressions of the forces are obtained by applying the Kirchhoff plate theory and the principle of virtual work. Subsequently, the nonlinear vibration equation of the system with magnetoelastic coupling is established using the Hamiltonian variational principle. Utilizing the established mechanical model, the principal-internal resonance is analytically solved employing the Galerkin and multiple scales methods, with stability criteria for steady-state motion solutions determined using Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the nonlinear dynamics of the system are analyzed through analytical and numerical examples, and the influences of different physical parameter variations on the dynamic behavior are discussed. Results indicate that variations in physical parameters affect the amplitude, resonance region, and regions of multiple solutions of the system. Moreover, the system may transition to chaos through quasiperiodic torus breakdown or period-doubling bifurcation due to changes in physical parameters. The results of this study provide theoretical references for research in magnetoelastic coupling nonlinear dynamics in fields of magnetic drive and electromagnetic control, as well as for product design and optimization. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024."

The state-of-the-art methods of microservice architectural granularity detection primarily focus on the service level, which lacks consideration of detailed information such as interfaces, and these methods also lack considerations about semantic information related to business logic, leading to lower accuracy in the detection results. To address these issues, we introduce ASDMG, which takes semantic information within the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into consideration, integrating them with data dependency to extract business topic relationships of functions. It performs interface-oriented business topic clustering, allowing comprehensive detection of granularity smells both within individual microservices as well as the overall microservice architecture. Experiments were conducted using 5 open-source microservice systems in different scales and domains. Results show that ASDMG achieves an average precision of 83.41%, an average recall of 95.84%, and an average accuracy of 95.85% in detecting architectural granularity smells. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, it achieves better detection results and can improve the quality of microservice architecture. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Meanwhile, we also constructed a joint probability distribution model of drought and drought disasters, which can calculate the conditional probability of different grades of drought leading to different grades of drought disasters, then, we can calculate the drought disaster risk measurement(DDRM) based on the level of drought propagation, by combining the achievements of the above model and the determination of inhibitory or promoting mechanism in the disaster-forming process. Finally, we conducted an empirical study of the new method using Anhui Province as the research object. The results show that: (1) The improved Monte-Carlo model incorporates the Copula function and rank correlation coefficient, which can generate indicator sequences with correlation and maintain a similar correlation level to the original samples. (2) The fuzzy identification model of drought disaster can not only elucidate the propagation pattern of drought factors to drought disaster through numerous drought scenario simulations, but also effectively address the limitations of traditional drought risk research that heavily relies on long sequences of statistical data. (3) The DDRM can absolutely quantify the magnitude of regional inhibiting or promoting effects during the disaster formation process, which can make the assessment results comparable among the drought risk in different regions. The resultant findings offer crucial insights for pertinent decision-makers to alleviate the adverse effects of drought disaster. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Insulin protein (IP) plays an active role in drug discovery, medicine, and therapeutic methods. Unlike experimental protocols, computational predictors are fast and can predict IP accurately. This work introduces a model, called IP-GCN for IP prediction. The patterns from IP are extracted by K-spaced position specific scoring matrix (KS-PSSM) and the model training is accomplished using powerful deep learning tool, called Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Additionally, we implemented Pseudo Amino Acid Composition (PseAAC) and Dipeptide Composition (DPC) for feature encoding to assess the predictive performance of GCN. To evaluate the efficacy of our novel approach, we compare its performance with well-known deep/machine learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Extremely Randomized Tree (ERT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Predictive results demonstrate that the proposed predictor (IP-GCN) secured the best performance on both training and testing datasets. The novel computational would be fruitful in diabetes drug discovery and contributes to research for therapeutic interventions in various Insulin protein associated diseases. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

In this study, we investigate newcomers’ learning of these rules when being taught them explicitly. Our data come from academically motivated high-school students who took a special course in undergraduate mathematics. The course teacher dedicated three academic hours to introducing and explaining selected rules of proof to support students’ shift to the new discourse. The homework assignment consisted of typical proof-requiring problems and a scriptwriting task, asking students to compose a dialogue between fictional characters about a proof-related mistake of their choice. We analyzed the differences and similarities between the rules discussed in the classroom and those that students addressed and implemented in their proofs. The analysis showed that while students’ solutions to proof-requiring problems required rule implementation, fictitious dialogues opened the space for rule formulation and substantiation. In many cases, the students discussed the rules presented in the classroom, extending, elaborating, and specifying the teacher’s formulations. Furthermore, while the students’ proofs were mainly consistent with the teacher’s expectations, some of their rule formulations were more radical and overgeneralized than expected. These findings suggest that newcomers’ communication about the rules of proof may lag behind their capability to implement those rules to prove mathematical statements. © The Author(s) 2024."

School environments are increasingly recognised, both by scientists and policymakers, as priority areas to increase children's exposure to GBI. However, studies analysing the spatial and temporal patterns of GBI in school environments are still scarce, especially those considering a cross-city and equity perspective. To contribute to the expanding field of urban environmental justice in the context of children's geographies, our research aims to assess the (un)equal spatial patterns of school-related GBI across four large European cities (Brussels, Barcelona, Rotterdam, and Paris) and over time (between 2006 and 2018). For this purpose, we used EU-comparable green and blue land cover and tree canopy cover data, together with schools’ socio-economic characteristics (median income and educational attainment) based on local neighbourhood-level data. Through geospatial and statistical analyses on 1259 primary schools, our study reveals significant positive correlations between school-related GBI indicators and socio-economic variables in Brussels and Rotterdam. In contrast, negative correlations were found in Barcelona and Paris. Overall, the four cities show very distinct patterns of school-related socio-environmental inequities and no substantial GBI gains during the period analysed, suggesting that greening initiatives in and around school environments are still to be upscaled at the city level. © 2024 The Authors"

With a focus on improving engagement and academic performance, we address the critical need for effective pedagogical approaches in a virtual environment. The study involves 176 students, encompassing a wide demographic spectrum, during 2021, and utilises an extensive theoretical framework to support the ELT approach. The core of the study is an innovative learning model based on hands-on experiments, designed to enhance engagement, deepen understanding, and promote active learning. Students perform a series of experiments, reflect on their observations, connect theory to practice, and answer challenging questions that link theoretical concepts with real-world applications. Our results reveal a significant improvement in students’ academic outcomes, with higher average grades and reduced course abandonment compared to the previous year. The study also explores students’ perceptions, revealing their appreciation for this active learning approach, as it enhances motivation, concentration, enjoyment, and perceived learning. Collecting data through questionnaires, in-class feedback, andpost-class email reflections further validates the effectiveness of the Kolb-based ELT approach. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the power of implementing hands-on experiential learning in virtual education settings, fostering deeper engagement and improved academic outcomes, especially in a post-pandemic world where such pedagogical innovation is vital. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd"

To develop the data-driven BN model, a dataset comprising 980 accidents from 2000 to 2023 in the Liaoning Sea area is initially established. Subsequently, the data-driven BN model is constructed using the Tree Augmented Network (TAN) learning algorithm and expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Finally, comprehensive BN analysis encompassing strength of influence assessment, sensitivity analysis, scenario simulation, and model verification is conducted based on the developed TAN-BN model. The results demonstrate that distinct types of maritime accidents exhibit varying sensitivities to seasonal variations and time of day; contact and groundings are primarily encountered by general cargo ships while fire and explosions are more prevalent among bulk carriers. Fishing boats tend to be vulnerable to collisions whereas sinking accidents are most commonly associated with sand carriers. © 2024 The Institution of Chemical Engineers"

Subsequently, a water quality map was generated employing large and small fuzzy membership functions. Additionally, advanced prediction models using neural networks were employed to forecast future water pollution trends. Fuzzy method results indicated higher pollution levels in the northern regions of the study area compared to the southern parts. Furthermore, the water quality prediction models demonstrated that the LSTM model exhibited superior predictive performance (R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 0.007).

Such chaotic dynamics could be substantially influenced by the occurrence of a breathing crack, characterized by a cyclic opening and closing process. However, current models for breathing cracks primarily focus on beam-like structures and often rely on the assumption of periodic dynamical responses, which is inadequate for depicting the chaotic vibrations experienced by cracked LVPs. To that end, this study presents a novel nonlinear breathing crack model (NBCM) to precisely characterize the breathing effect on chaotic dynamics of large-amplitude vibrating plates containing a parallel part-through breathing crack. By refining the line spring model and devising a mathematical expression for crack parameters and dynamical responses, the NBCM-based governing equation for cracked LVPs is derived with a Duffing type expression having a quadratic term. Through the utilization of the harmonic balance method and the Hilbert–Hughes–Taylor algorithm, both analytical and numerical dynamic responses of the cracked LVP based on the NBCM are obtained. Comprehensive nonlinearity analyses are then conducted, including hardening nonlinearity, breathing nonlinearity, and bifurcation nonlinearity. Comparison results demonstrate the superiority of the presented nonlinear breathing crack model in characterizing the chaotic dynamics of LVPs with breathing cracks. Accordingly, the presented NBCM shows significant potential for identifying abnormalities within practical engineering plate-like structures when considering the effects of crack breathing. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, EFs are often examined independently, obscuring their symbiotic contribution. We examined the relationship between students’ holistic EF profiles and their academic success. Methods: We sampled over 1200 7–15 year old students from a diverse school district (16 % White; 32 % low income) in the United States. We used 9 EF assessments to construct cognitive profiles via self-organizing maps. We then related profiles to academic achievement scores from both laboratory-based assessments and state-administered standardized tests of reading and math. Results: Six profiles differed in EF performance, but their differences in academic achievement did not suggest a linear relationship between individual EFs and academic skill. Conclusions: We show cognitive profiles based on individual strengths and weaknesses in EFs can reveal multiple cognitive paths to the same academic outcome. © 2024 The Author(s)"

In this context, localized states appear due to the interaction and locking of front waves connecting different extended states. In the tristable regime investigated here two extended uniform states coexist with one periodic Turing pattern. This scenario leads to the transition from the standard-homoclinic-snaking-related localized states associated with uniform-pattern bistability to the collapsed-homoclinic-snaking-related states which arise in a uniform-bistable configuration. We find that this transition is mediated by the emergence of hybrid states through codimension-two necking bifurcations.

We applied inverse probability weighting, derived from propensity scores estimated by a Generalized Boosting Model with multiple treatments, to account for other teachers' and students' characteristics when evaluating student performance. Results showed that teachers who graduated in mathematics through distance education had classes with higher grades than teachers with other academic backgrounds or without higher education, particularly in rural schools and among students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Moreover, no statistically significant differences were observed in the performance of students taught by teachers trained in mathematics through distance education as opposed to traditional face-to-face training.

Dynamical analysis is conducted from equilibrium points, Lyapunov exponents and bifurcation diagrams, Poincaré map, 0–1 tests, complexity, coexisting attractors, and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) test. The Lyapunov exponents and bifurcation diagrams revealed that 1D-MMSCA exhibit rich dynamical behaviors, including fixed points, periodic orbits, transient quasi-periodic cycles, limit cycles, and period-doubling bifurcations. The 2D-MMSCA demonstrates simultaneous homogeneous and heterogeneous multi-stability and extreme multi-stability. Furthermore, an analog circuit is designed and simulated, and the results verify the circuit realizability and correctness of the MMSCAs. By utilizing an improved Euler algorithm and STM32 microcontroller, the implementation of MMSCAs are achieved, enhancing their applicability in the embedded systems domain.

The paper begins by exploring the necessary preliminaries to describe the model. Subsequently, we examine the model's well-posedness, focusing on the positivity and boundedness of solutions. The basic reproduction number is then derived using the next-generation matrix method. The model exhibits two stable states: the mathematics-free equilibrium point and the learning equilibrium point for students who struggle with mathematics. The study shows that when the basic reproduction number is less than one, the mathematics-free equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable. Conversely, when the basic reproduction number exceeds one, the learning equilibrium point for students who struggle with mathematics is globally asymptotically stable. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical findings. In the last part of the paper, we present a structured model involving two distinct strategies aimed at improving the mathematical skills of students who encounter difficulties in this subject. The first strategy consists of offering individualized or small-group tutoring sessions, focusing on challenging topics and using alternative teaching methods. The second strategy entails adjusting the overall program and pedagogical approach to better respond to diverse learning needs.

Data sources included interviews with five teachers who taught high-school mathematics before, during, and after their academic mathematics studies. All teachers provided tangible examples of fundamental changes in instructional practices that they explicitly linked to new knowledge acquired in the academic mathematics courses. The domain of analysis in general, and the topics of integrals and derivatives in particular, were central in the teachers’ illustrations of changes they made in their teaching, although other mathematical topics and domains were also mentioned. The reported changes were mostly associated with emphasis on mathematical explanations, exposition of two key elements of the deductive structure of mathematics: definition and proof, an increased focus on formal mathematics, and portrayal of mathematics as a wide and varied discipline.

Since the experimental discovery of MMOs, unnested MMO-incrementing bifurcations (MMOIBs) have been observed in numerous systems, including the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, chlorite–thiosulfate reaction, and hydrodynamic and electrochemical systems; in such systems, daughter oscillations [L1s,L2s×m] can be observed for successive values of m. In this paper, we investigate high-order singly nested MMOs of the form [C0,m,D0,m×p] for increasing values of m, i.e., C0,m is followed by D0,m repeated p times, where C0,m≡[C0,D0×m], D0,m≡[C0,D0×(m+1)], and C0 and D0 are adjacent fundamental MMOs, e.g., C0=1s and D0=1s+1. This work extends our previous analysis that was conducted on the lowest-order case (m=1), and we demonstrate that the high-order (m≥2) singly nested MMOs can indeed occur. We investigate the cases of m=2,3,4, and 10, although we note that the regions in which nested MMOs can be observed become increasingly narrow for larger values of m. These bifurcations are confirmed via one-parameter bifurcation diagrams, time-series waveforms, and first return plots. Furthermore, we present notable similarities between the Nagumo–Sato piecewise-linear discontinuous one-dimensional map and the forced BVP oscillator. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Despite its prominence in public and political discourse, however, there is no systemic evidence on the levels and patterns of school segregation. Drawing on the literature on the post-apartheid political settlement and sociological theories of opportunity hoarding, we explain how the small White minority and, to a lesser extent, the new Black middle class monopolized access to South Africa’s most prestigious schools following the abolition of de jure segregation in 1994. Using the 2021 Annual School Survey—an administrative dataset covering all South African schools—and the 2019 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study school survey, we find very high levels of school segregation along racial as well as socioeconomic lines. White students almost exclusively attend former White schools, have little exposure to the low-income Black majority, and are vastly overrepresented in elite public and private schools. We argue that in South Africa and other contexts with under-resourced education systems, elite capture of the few high-performing schools serves to reproduce race and class privilege. © The Author(s) 2024."

Beside well-known disabling symptoms - such as palpitations, reduced exercise tolerance, and chest discomfort - there is growing evidence that an alteration of deep cerebral hemodynamics due to AF increases the risk of vascular dementia and cognitive impairment, even in the absence of clinical strokes. The alteration of deep cerebral circulation in AF represents one of the least investigated among the possible mechanisms. Lenticulostriate arteries (LSAs) are small perforating arteries mainly departing from the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and susceptible to small vessel disease, which is one of the mechanisms of subcortical vascular dementia development. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of different LSAs morphologies on the cerebral hemodynamics during AF. Methods: By combining a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of LSAs with 7T high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we performed different CFD-based multivariate regression analyses to detect which geometrical and morphological vessel features mostly affect AF hemodynamics in terms of wall shear stress. We exploited 17 cerebral 7T-MRI derived LSA vascular geometries extracted from 10 subjects and internal carotid artery data from validated 0D cardiovascular-cerebral modeling as inflow conditions. Results: Our results revealed that few geometrical variables - namely the size of the MCA and the bifurcation angles between MCA and LSA - are able to satisfactorily predict the AF impact. In particular, the present study indicates that LSA morphologies exhibiting markedly obtuse LSA-MCA inlet angles and small MCA size downstream of the LSA-MCA bifurcation may be more prone to vascular damage induced by AF. Conclusions: The present MRI-based computational study has been able for the first time to: (i) investigate the net impact of LSAs vascular morphologies on cerebral hemodynamics during AF events; (ii) detect which combination of morphological features worsens the hemodynamic response in the presence of AF. Awaiting necessary clinical confirmation, our analysis suggests that the local hemodynamics of LSAs is affected by their geometrical features and some LSA morphologies undergo greater hemodynamic alterations in the presence of AF. © 2024"

Methods: The present study used a large-scale dataset, consisting of participants from 43 countries/regions, to test whether societal collectivism–individualism would moderate the relationship between three types of parental involvement (asking, helping and checking) in homework and elementary school students' academic performance in math and science. Results: The multi-level analyses revealed diverse effects of different parental involvement behaviours for homework. Helping and checking behaviours were generally negatively associated with elementary school students' academic achievement, but asking behaviours were positively associated with their academic achievement. Importantly, the positive effect of asking behaviours was stronger, while the negative effect of helping behaviours was weaker in collectivistic societies than in individualistic societies.

This research validates the assumption of independence previously used to develop a probability-based form for SL. Independence greatly simplifies the mathematics of the new form, in particular, the ability to decompose a pavement condition model into multiple relatively simple submodels. Friction is shown to not correlate to the other two components. FOD and roughness are conditionally independent with a latent variable of crack and spall density.

As an extended algorithm of Rapidly-exploring Random Tree(RRT), the optimal RRT(RRT*) has advantages in asymptotic optimality. However, it still suffers from a slow convergence rate and expensive initial solution heavily. Besides, it cannot provide an effective path planning solution when dealing with narrow passages. To overcome this problem, an adaptive bidirectional quick RRT*(ABQ-RRT*) method is proposed for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) in narrow passages. Firstly, the cost function has been redefined by taking into account both the Euclidean distance and the turning angle of the UAV. Secondly, the number of failures in the collision detection is considered and an adaptive goal-biased sampling strategy is adopted to obtain higher-quality sampling points. Thirdly, by local sampling near the obstacles, the type of the local environment is quickly judged. Also, the repulsion field is superimposed to effectively avoid obstacles. Then, during the process of selecting the optimal parent node from the set of candidate nodes, the sorted possible parents consider both the neighborhood nodes and their ancestors to obtain better paths. At last, the effectiveness of ABQ-RRT* is confirmed by comparing it with several other improved RRT algorithms through simulations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Undirected path graphs, directed path graphs and rooted directed path graphs are intermediate graph classes, defined, respectively, as the intersection graphs of paths of a tree, of directed paths of an oriented tree, and of directed paths of an out branching. All of these path graphs have vertex leafage 2. Dominating Set, Connected Dominating Set, and Steiner tree problems are (Formula presented.) -hard parameterized by the size of the solution on chordal graphs, (Formula presented.) -complete on undirected path graphs, and polynomial-time solvable on rooted directed path graphs, and hence also on interval graphs. We further investigate the (parameterized) complexity of all these problems when constrained to chordal graphs, taking the vertex leafage and the aforementioned classes into consideration. We prove that Dominating Set, Connected Dominating Set, and Steiner tree are (Formula presented.) on chordal graphs when parameterized by the size of the solution plus the vertex leafage, and that Weighted Connected Dominating Set is polynomial-time solvable on strongly chordal graphs. We also introduce a new subclass of undirected path graphs, which we call in–out rooted directed path graphs, as the intersection graphs of directed paths of an in–out branching. We prove that Dominating Set, Connected Dominating Set, and Steiner tree are solvable in polynomial time on this class, generalizing the polynomiality for rooted directed path graphs proved by Booth and Johnson (SIAM J.

Accompanying the developments of computational science and 3D digital scanning technology, conformal mapping has also found wide applications in geometric modeling, computer graphics, medical imaging and other fields. In the virtual image or animation world, conformal mapping offers a convenient approach to achieve various shape changes of planar regions and 3D surfaces. In this work, we propose a promising approach, i.e., through the stress-free growth of hyperelastic plates, to realize arbitrary planar and surface conformal mappings in the physical world. The growth field in a hyperelastic plate can be represented by a symmetric tensor field. For any given planar or surface conformal mappings with explicit analytical expressions, the formulas of growth functions in the growth tensor are derived. In the case that the target surfaces of conformal mappings have no explicit analytical expressions, we further propose a numerical scheme to determine the growth data in the hyperelastic plates. The efficiency of the approach proposed in the current work is validated through several typical examples, where the 3D finite element simulations are conducted. The results demonstrate that, by incorporating the obtained growth functions or growth data, the target surfaces can be generated accurately through growth deformations of hyperelastic plates. As an application of the current work, we further propose an approach of shape-control for double-layer grid structures with plate forms. According to any given target shapes, the values of elongation or contraction of the bar elements are determined, then the desired deformations of the grid structures can be realized. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

In learning contexts, this implies that high boredom may be experienced both by low- and high-achieving students. Aims: This research aimed to explore the existence and prevalence of boredom due to being over- and under-challenged in mathematics, for which empirical evidence is lacking. Sample: We employed a sample of 1.407 students (fifth to ninth graders) from all three secondary school tracks (lower, middle and upper) in Bavaria (Germany). Methods: Boredom was assessed via self-report and achievement via a standardized mathematics test. We used latent profile analysis to identify groups characterized by different levels of boredom and achievement, and we additionally examined gender and school track as group membership predictors. Results: Results revealed four distinct groups, of which two showed considerably high boredom. One was coupled with low achievement on the test (i.e. ‘over-challenged group’, 13% of the total sample), and one was coupled with high achievement (i.e. ‘under-challenged group’, 21%). Furthermore, we found a low boredom and high achievement (i.e. ‘well-off group’, 27%) and a relatively low boredom low achievement group (i.e. ‘indifferent group’, 39%). Girls were overrepresented in the over-challenged group, and students from the upper school track were underrepresented in the under-challenged group. Conclusion: Our research emphasizes the need to openly discuss and further investigate boredom due to being over- and under-challenged. © 2024 The Author(s).

Fuzzy-AHP, as an alternative to traditional AHP, accommodates uncertainty and imprecision, offering a decision-making method that is more adaptable and realistic. The F-AHP methodology, delineated in a seven-step process, incorporates pairwise comparisons, fuzzy mathematics, and linguistic variables to compute fuzzy weights for waste management criteria, encompassing physical, biological, social, and economic aspects. Hospital 1, with a weight value of 0.406 and strict adherence to the Bio-medical Waste Management (Amendment), 2018 rules and regulations of the Government of India, emerges as the most promising sustainability hospital based on the F-AHP analysis findings. Conversely, Hospital 5 exhibits the poorest waste management practices among the surveyed hospitals, earning the lowest possible ranking. While the proposed F-AHP method provides valuable insights, the study is limited to a specific geographic area (Gwalior) and potential variations based on environmental factors. Additionally, the practical implications extend beyond the general emphasis on continuous monitoring to include specific actions for hospitals to enhance their waste management systems. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

Aims: The current study investigates whether number sense contributes to such arithmetic tasks when other cognitive factors are controlled for (including those that mediate the link); and whether this contribution varies as a function of participants' individual maths fluency levels. Sample: Four hundred and thirty-seven Chinese schoolchildren (186 females; Mage = 83.49 months) completed a range of cognitive measures in Grade 1 (no previous classroom training) and in Grade 2 (a year later). Methods: Number sense, arithmetic (addition and subtraction), spatial ability, visuo-spatial working memory, perception, reaction time, character reading and general intelligence were measured. Results: Our data showed that the link between number sense and arithmetic was weaker in Grade 1 (Beta =.15 for addition and.06 (ns) for subtraction) compared to Grade 2 (.23–.28), but still persisted in children with no previous maths training. Further, math's performance in Grade 1 did not affect the link between number sense and maths performance in Grade 2. Conclusion: Our data extended previous findings by showing that number sense is linked with simple maths task performance even after controlling for multiple cognitive factors. Our results brought some evidence that number sense-arithmetic link is somewhat sensitive to previous formal maths education. Further research is needed, as the differences in effects between grades were quite small, and arithmetic in Grade 1 did not moderate the link at question in Grade 2. © 2024 British Psychological Society."

The proposed algorithm is employed to approximate the Bark scale to find a rational frequency partitioning that can be realized using RDNUFBs with less approximation error. The proposed Bark frequency partitioning is found to reduce the average deviation in centre frequency and bandwidth by 65.04% and 48.50%, respectively, and root-mean-square bandwidth deviation by 54.46% when compared to those of the existing perceptual wavelet approximation of Bark scale. In the first filter bank design approach discussed in the paper, a near-perfect reconstruction partially cosine modulated filter bank is employed to obtain the improved Bark frequency partitioning. In the second design approach, the hardware complexity of the PCM-based RDNUFB is reduced by deriving the channels with different sampling factors from the same prototype filter by the method of channel merging. There is a considerable reduction of 40.83% in the number of multipliers when merging of partially cosine modulated channels is employed. It is also found that both the proposed approaches can reduce the delay by 95.17% when compared to the existing rational tree approximation methods and hence, are suitable for real-time applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

In this paper, we develop a single reliable composite index employing fuzzy mathematical modelling that considers the effect of uncertainty and imprecision related to the specific nature of the phenomenon being measured. Additionally, we suggest a procedure for incorporating this new way of assigning priorities through multicriteria techniques. To this end, we propose a new multicriteria approach that introduces the recent notion of picture fuzzy sets to deal with uncertainty and imprecision in the assessment of objective and subjective dimensions of quality-of-life performance. To verify the effectiveness of the whole approach and the credibility of the results, we show its application for monitoring the quality of life in the European Union. Our results show that fuzzy numbers can be a useful tool when combined with multicriteria techniques in the prioritization phase of the criteria and that they increase the quality and reliability of the overall aggregate indicator. Furthermore, through statistical measures we found that in a picture environment the results are consistent regardless of the multi-criteria approach used to provide a final classification. © 2024 The Authors"

However, more information is needed about the underlying process behind this relationship among students with different mathematical abilities. Aims: This study examined the association between students' perceived teaching quality and achievement emotions in Chinese mathematics classrooms, focusing on students with different mathematics achievements. Samples: There are 1045 secondary school students (49.1% girls; Mage = 13.90, SD =.84) from Chinese mathematics classrooms in the present study. Methods: A multi-group structural equation model was adopted to test the relationship between teaching quality and achievement emotions between low- and high-achieving students. Results: Control-value appraisals mediated in teacher support and achievement emotions in both student groups. At the same time, control-value appraisals failed to mediate cognitive activation and achievement emotions in low-achieving students, while the mediating effect of control-value appraisals was identified in high-achieving students. Besides, classroom management was related to achievement emotions via academic value only in low-achieving students. In contrast, it was related to achievement emotions via control-value appraisals in high-achieving students. Conclusions: The results clarified the mediation roles of control-value appraisals in teaching quality and achievement emotions in students with low- and high-achieving achievements. Similarities and differences were also identified between the two student groups. Teacher support was beneficial to students' positive emotions while classroom management helped to lessen students' negative emotions.

However, they have often been criticized for being too complicated, hard to explain, and unsuitable for pedagogical purposes, particularly their delete operation. Sedgewick (in: Dagstuhl Workshop on Data Structures, 2008. https://sedgewick.io/wp-content/themes/sedgewick/papers/2008LLRB.pdf) identified the length of code as the root of the problems and introduced left-leaning red–black (LLRB) trees. The delete operation of LLRB trees has a compact recursive code. Unfortunately, it may perform many unnecessary operations. The crux of the deletion algorithm is dealing with a “deficient” subtree, that is one whose black-height has become one less than that of its sibling subtree. In this paper, we revisit 2–3 red–black trees and propose a parity-seeking delete algorithm with the basic idea of making a deficient subtree on a par with its sibling: either by fixing the deficient subtree or by turning the sibling deficient as well, ascending deficiency to the parent node. Interestingly, the proposed parity-seeking delete algorithm also works for 2–3–4 RB trees. Our experiments show that the proposed parity-seeking delete algorithm is as efficient as the best preceding RB trees. The proposed parity-seeking delete algorithm is easily understandable and suitable for pedagogical and practical purposes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024."

We give a constructive proof that this decomposition exists for all invariant tensors, after possibly enriching the simplicial complex.

While recent research on such use is promising overall, there are specific questions that have been left unanswered about the construct of presence in 360 videos. More specifically, research has yet to fully explore how video delivery devices and PST characteristics may impact presence. The purpose of this study was to respond to this gap in the literature by examining PST major, delivery device (ie, head mounted display vs. flat screen), and the interaction between the two in informing presence. A total of 93 PSTs watched 360 videos and then completed a questionnaire. Findings indicated that presence in head-mounted displays was related to emotions and agency. Conversely, presence with flat screens meant familiarity and control. Moreover, PST major was a predictor of presence, suggesting that 360 videos should be personalized according to PST career and professional goals. Finally, the interaction effect of preparing to teach K-12 mathematics and wearing a head-mounted display had a negative and statistically significant effect on participants' perceived presence, thus indicating a non-cumulative effect. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic 360 videos are increasingly used to support preservice teacher training. 360 videos for teacher education foster immersion, presence, and noticing skills. What this paper adds Empirical evidence that 360 videos experienced with head-mounted display facilitate agency and emotional involvement. Empirical evidence that 360 videos experienced with flat screens facilitate feelings of control. Data showed that preservice teachers' content area (math) was a positive predictor of presence in 360 videos. Implications for practice and/or policy Head-mounted displays show promise as a delivery mode for 360 videos in teacher education. 360 videos should be personalized according to PST career and professional goals. The eXtended Reality Presence Scale is confirmed as a robust instrument to measure presence in immersive environments. More research is needed to evaluate the scalability of this approach in other contexts. © 2024 British Educational Research Association."

He pointed out strong relationships between mathematics and all areas of human creation abilities. In particular, his investigations on the relationship between arts, including architecture, and mathematics in important historical phases reveal that the mathematics of an age is reflected aesthetically in the artistic styles or theories of art. His thesis posits that a high point in mathematics corresponds to a high point in art. Later on, Bense developed an aesthetic theory on the basis of mathematics, semiotics and information theory. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

However, this convenience has brought about an increasingly severe concern: the risk of data privacy breaches. To tackle this issue, a novel scheme for personalized trajectory data publishing is proposed, leveraging a noisy prefix tree structure. The scheme begins by constructing multiple trajectory equivalence classes based on the spatiotemporal characteristics of trajectories, followed by the calculation of distinct Hilbert curve orders for each equivalence class. Subsequently, the Hilbert curve is employed to partition the location points within each equivalence class, with the aid of a scoring function that selects optimal center points to replace other location points effectively. Additionally, appropriate encoding levels are determined for each partitioned region, facilitating the conversion of the center points into binary encoded characters using Hilbert-Geohash. This conversion process safeguards against data privacy leakage by obfuscating the original latitude and longitude coordinates. Ultimately, a noisy prefix tree is constructed to store the binary encoding in its nodes. To ensure data privacy preservation, a novel privacy budget allocation approach is introduced, applying suitable Laplace noise to each node. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is confirmed through experimental comparisons with existing schemes, employing real datasets and demonstrating its notable performance in terms of both data privacy and utility. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Some examples of these properties are invariance, controllability and observability. The task addressed in this paper is to develop the geometric tools for fractional systems using the diffusive representation (also known as the distributed frequency) model. The mathematics involved in this approach is different from the classical case as fractional systems are inherently infinite dimensional. Unlike the integer order derivative, the fractional derivative is a non-local operator, and so the evolution of the so-called pseudo-state depends on not just its current value but also its past history. Thus, the notion of an initial condition for a fractional system can come in different forms. This leads to different kinds of fractional derivative operators. With some of these operators, the semigroup property is lost. With the distributed frequency model, the initial condition comes in the form of an initialization function. This takes care of the infinite dimensional nature of fractional systems. Furthermore, the distributed frequency model retains the semigroup property. This is useful in developing invariance and controlled invariance for fractional systems. Moreover, these properties of fractional systems are verified numerically using a higher order finite-dimensional approximation, which retains all the geometric properties of the distributed frequency model. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Aim: We studied the effects of physically active maths lessons on children's maths performance and maths-related effects, and whether gender and previous mathematical or motor skills modify these effects. Sample: A total of 22 volunteered teachers and their pupils with signed consent (N = 397, mean age: 9.3 years, 51% females) participated in a 5-month, teacher-led, multi-arm, cluster-randomized controlled trial. Methods: The intervention included a PAL group (20 min of physically active learning in each 45-min lesson), a breaks group (two 5-min PA breaks in each 45-min lesson) and a control group (traditional teaching). Maths performance was assessed with a tailored curriculum-based test. Maths-related enjoyment, self-perceptions and anxiety were measured with a self-reported questionnaire. The individual-level intervention effects were tested via covariate-adjusted linear mixed-effect models with school classes serving as random effects. Results: Changes in maths performance or self-perceptions did not differ between the intervention groups. Maths anxiety in learning situations increased in the PAL group (effect.28, 95% CI =.01–.56); there was no change in the other groups. Subgroup analyses suggested that maths anxiety increased in the PAL group among children in the two lowest tertiles of motor skills. It decreased in the highest tertile. Enjoyment decreased in the breaks group among pupils in the lowest motor skill tertile. Conclusions: Physically active maths lessons did not affect maths performance or self-perceptions but had divergent effects on maths anxiety and enjoyment, depending on motor skills. © 2024 The Authors.

First, because of the strong coupling and nonlinearity of the OTB unit, the unit model was accurately linearized using the mathematical concepts of Lie derivatives and relative orders. Subsequently, the finite time integral sliding mode control (FTISMC) strategy was developed. Notably, the maximum relative tracking errors for the main steam pressure, separator steam enthalpy, and active power at a load ramp rate of 6 % RBL/min based on the FTISMC strategy were only 0.065 %, 1.85 % and 35 % of those under the stair-like generalized predictive control (GPC) with feedforward strategy at a load ramp rate of 2.21 % RBL/min. Lastly, unlike previous work, the adaptive fuzzy finite time integral sliding mode control (AFFTISMC) strategy was employed to address both input and output disturbances, and the maximum dynamic errors of the main steam pressure, separator steam enthalpy, and active power do not exceed 1.4 %, 1 %, and 63 % of the FTISMC strategy. Therefore, the AFFTISMC strategy substantially enhances the flexible operation capability of the unit, offering valuable insights for optimizing the coordinated control system (CCS) of thermal power units to facilitate greater absorption of new energy electricity. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

This paper focuses on the design, implementation, and evaluation of the programs aimed at empowering female students in engineering, where it discusses the methodologies used, the effectiveness of the programs, and the impact on students' perceptions and attitudes toward engineering. Several retention programs that target female engineering students were employed, such as providing a peer-supportive environment, establishing a society of women engineers in university, organizing cooperative events and activities, and exposing them to successful female role models. The effectiveness of the programs was evaluated using a survey administered to female undergraduate students at Taylor’s University, Malaysia as part of a one-year project titled “EWE: Empowering Engineering Female Students to Improve Retention and Progression”, funded by Engineering Information Foundation (EiF). By using thematic coding and statistical tests, the survey aimed to investigate the motives behind female students' decisions to pursue engineering as a degree and assess Self-efficacy and Sustained Interest in Engineering as a result of the empowerment programs.

In this context, given a set of vertices S(|S|≥2,) a tree that connects all vertices in S is called an S-Steiner tree. This helps to measure how well a network G can connect any set of S vertices together. In an S-Steiner tree, if each vertex in S has only one connection, it is called a pendant S-Steiner tree. Two pendant S-Steiner trees, T and T′, are internally disjoint if E(T)∩E(T′)=∅ and V(T)∩V(T′)=S. The local pendant tree-connectivity, denoted as τG(S), represents the maximum number of internally disjoint pendant S-Steiner trees in graph G. For an integer k with 2≤k≤n, where n is the number of vertices, the pendant k-tree-connectivity, denoted as τk(G), is defined as τk(G)=min{τG(S):S⊆V(G),|S|=k}. This paper focuses on studying the pendant 3-tree-connectivity of augmented cubes, which are modified versions of hypercubes designed to enhance connectivity and reduce diameter. This research demonstrates that the pendant 3-tree-connectivity of augmented cubes, denoted as τ3(AQn) is 2n-3.

Then, the weighted voting method is applied to the selection step of sub nodes in the Monte Carlo tree search process.

A fifth-order Lorenz model is derived using a truncated Fourier series representation involving only two terms. The resulting heat transfer is calculated in terms of thermal Nusselt number by solving finite-amplitude equations numerically. The influence of the governing physical parameters on heat transport is analyzed and depicted graphically.

While gesture's importance in conveying shared meaning is recognized, its role in collaborative group settings remains understudied. This gap hinders accurate and equitable assessment and instruction, particularly for linguistically diverse students. Advancements in multimodal learning analytics, leveraging sensor technologies, offer innovative solutions for capturing and analysing body movements. This study employs these novel approaches to demonstrate how learners' machine-detected body movements during the learning process relate to their verbal and nonverbal contributions to the co-construction of embodied math knowledge. These findings substantiate the feasibility of utilizing learners' machine-detected body movements as a valid indicator for inferring their engagement with the collaborative knowledge construction process. In addition, we empirically validate that these inferred different levels of learner engagement indeed impact the desired learning outcomes of the intervention. This study contributes to our scientific understanding of multimodal approaches to knowledge expression and assessment in learning, teaching, and collaboration.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Previous research emphasizes the importance of gestures as essential tools for constructing common ground and reflecting shared meaning-making in learning and teaching contexts. The prior studies in multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) suggest that certain forms of body movements and postures can be differentiated based on the automatic detection of upper body joint locations. Empirical observations indicate that co-thought gestures typically involve smaller hand or arms movement that are closer to the gesturer's body than co-speech gestures used in interpersonal communication. What this paper adds This paper fills the research gap by examining the use of gestures in collaborative learning, offering insights into how individuals contribute verbally and nonverbally to collaborative knowledge construction. This paper introduces the concept of using machine-detected body movements as a viable proxy for inferring learners' engagement in collaborative knowledge-building activities. Leverages sensor technologies for automatic detection of body movements, the innovative approach in this work seeks to overcome the time-intensive and laborious process of manually coding gestures. Implications for practice and/or policy By recognizing the potential significance of learners' body movements in indicating engagement levels with collaborative knowledge-building activities, instructors can set up computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments to enable capturing these movements. Given the crucial role of gestures in learning, teaching, and collaboration, educators can create more equitable formative assessment practices for linguistically diverse students by developing strategies that align with multimodal forms of knowledge expression. Research can expand beyond mathematics to explore the transferability of these findings to other subjects, helping educators create comprehensive pedagogical approaches that leverage multimodal interactions across disciplines. © 2024 The Authors.

We explore in detail the challenges we have encountered in our attempts to apply principles from the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. We focus on tensions we have experienced when simultaneously applying multiple principles and balancing these with other educational considerations. Specifically, we consider trade-offs between redundancy versus clarity, seductive details versus richness, personalisation and emotional design versus abstraction, spatial contiguity and signalling versus parsimony, and pre-training and worked examples versus exploration. We examine the choices and dilemmas we faced, and illustrate our emerging attempts to resolve these tensions through presenting multiple examples from our design work.

Buckling failure is one of the most important failure modes for these shells under external pressure. In existing buckling studies of cylindrical pressure hulls, FEM is the most popular analysis method but not efficient enough when dealing with structures with complex material distributions such as the variable stiffness composite shells. Motivated by this, an isogeometric method for buckling prediction and post-buckling analysis of variable stiffness composite underwater pressure shell is proposed in this article. In this method, based on Reissner–Mindlin shell formulas undergoing large deformation, a buckling analysis framework in IGA forms is established. Then a modified arc-length method is proposed based on kinematics used in the shell formulas, and is used to overcome the inaccuracy caused by the 2 degrees of freedom node rotation in the prediction step of arc-length method. In addition, the influence of bifurcation is considered, which may seriously affect the precision of buckling behavior simulation when the limit point is close to a bifurcation point. The computational accuracy of this framework has been validated in a series of constant stiffness composite shell cases involving buckling load prediction and post-buckling behavior simulation. For variable stiffness composite hull cases, this framework achieves the same precision as FEM with fewer elements. Therefore, the proposed framework provides an efficient way for the buckling design of underwater variable stiffness composite pressure hulls. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Machine learning technologies are of great interest for predicting public transportation usage. While these technologies outperform many other techniques, they suffer from limited interpretability. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools and techniques that offer post-hoc explanations of the obtained predictions are gaining popularity. This paper proposes an advanced tree-based ensemble algorithm for public transportation usage rate prediction. We aim to explain the predictions both with the most widely used technique of XAI, Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) and in the light of the rules presented. To predict the total public transportation usage, the proposed model combines all types of public transportation, categorized as ferry, railway, and bus, unlike most existing studies focusing on a single kind of public transport. Besides the sort of transportation, the day of the week, whether the day is special, and the daily ratio of passenger types were identified as model features for predicting the daily usage of each type of public transportation. We tested the proposed model using an open data set from Izmir City, Turkey. While the model had superior prediction performance, the explanations showed that the type of public transportation, weekday, and the ratio of full-fare passengers have the highest SHAP values, and the model features have many interactions. We also validated our results using an online data set showing Google search trends. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

With the rise of multi-language code bases, new techniques addressing cross-language code clone detection enable the analysis of polyglot systems. Such techniques have not yet been applied to the mobile apps' domain, which are naturally polyglot. Native mobile app developers must synchronize their code base in at least two different programming languages. App synchronization is a difficult and time-consuming maintenance task, as features can rapidly diverge between platforms, and feature identification must be performed manually. The end goal of this work is to provide an analysis framework to reduce the impact of app synchronization. A first step in this direction consists in a structural algorithm for cross-language clone detection, called OUT OF STEP, exploiting the idea behind enriched concrete syntax trees. Such trees are used as a common intermediate representation built from programming languages' grammars, to detect similarities between app code bases. Our technique finds code similarities with over 80% for the evaluation of language features, where Type 1-3 clones are manually injected for the analysis of both single- and cross-language cases for Kotlin and Dart. We validate the feasibility and correctness of our approach through the evaluation of the main language constructs for Kotlin and Dart. To validate the effectiveness we use a first case study detecting clones between 12 sorting algorithms across Kotlin and Dart, identifying clone similarities with a precision between 67% and 95%. Finally, we use a corpus of 144 mobile apps implemented in Kotlin and Dart, correctly identifying code similarities for the full application logic. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Employing the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP), the study evaluates COPD prevalence, comorbidities, healthcare access, and individual health assessments. Given the mounting evidence linking environmental pollutants to COPD exacerbations, the research probes the influence of TRI sites on respiratory health, integrating Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to scrutinize the geospatial vulnerability of communities neighboring TRI sites. Socio-demographic disparities, economic conditions, and air pollution are emphasized in the analysis. The EPA's Toxic Release Inventory serves as the cornerstone for assessing the association between TRI proximity and COPD prevalence. The analysis uncovers a notable inverse correlation between distance from TRI sites and COPD prevalence, signaling potential health risks for populations residing closer to these facilities. Moreover, factors such as minority status, low income, and air pollution are associated with higher COPD prevalence, underscoring the imperative of comprehending the interplay between environmental exposure and respiratory health. This study bridges gaps in the literature by addressing the geographical nexus between COPD prevalence and pollution exposure. By leveraging FAHP, the research furnishes a holistic understanding of the multifaceted factors influencing vulnerability to COPD.

Most existing studies investigating the dynamic characteristics of DE structures neglect the viscoelasticity and strain-stiffening effects of materials, with only a few offering approximate analytical solutions. This paper establishes the governing equation for the dynamics of a DE balloon, utilizing the principle of virtual work and considering material viscoelasticity and strain-stiffening effects through linear damping and the Gent hyperelastic model, respectively. The nonlinear governing equations are simplified using the Chebyshev polynomial approximation. The multiple scales method is applied to derive approximate solutions for the structure's free vibration under static voltage excitation and parametrically excited vibration under harmonic voltage excitation. The accuracy of these approximate analytical solutions is validated by comparison with numerical solutions. Additionally, the paper analyzes stability and bifurcation phenomena through time-domain response curves, amplitude-frequency curves, and phase trajectories. Furthermore, the influence of the stretching limit, voltage, and damping on the nonlinear vibration of the balloon structure is studied, providing a valuable theoretical foundation for the future design and utilization of dielectric elastomers. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS"

This is realized by taking the multifold benefits of isogeometric PHT-Splines to (1) discretize the C1 continuous weak form of plate structures, (2) develop a C0 continuous density field for the material distribution in TO and inherently remove the need for filters, and (3) provide a hierarchical tree structure for the structural mesh to effortlessly implement an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) strategy. Moreover, to ensure continuity between isogeometric patches, we adopt a strong C1 coupling between the boundaries. This is established by constructing new basis functions, defined as a linear combination of existing C0 functions at the patch interfaces. The density field in TO is further enhanced with a first-neighbourhood smoothening algorithm based on the Shepard function to generate printable topologies and alleviate the post-processing stages after optimization. An element-centre density, based on the control point densities of the isogeometric mesh, is used as the marking scheme for the AMR to determine the subdomains to be refined. Utilizing the Geometry Independent Field approximaTion, the design and adaptive analysis-optimization stages were independently discretized respectively through NURBS and PHT-Splines, allowing easy transfer of multi-patch geometries from industry-standard packages. Multiple numerical examples illustrate the stability of the multi-patch algorithm in optimizing the geometries effectively.

A variety of robust methods, including attention mechanisms and convolutional neural networks, have been extensively utilized to tackle this complex task. Better experimental results are obtained by using graph convolutional networks (GCN) based on semantic dependency trees in previous studies. Therefore, abundant methods begin to use sentence structure information to complete this task. However, only the loose connection between aspect words and contexts is realized in some practices due to sentences may contain complex relations. To solve this problem, Twain-Syntax graph convolutional network model is proposed, which can utilize multiple syntactic structure information simultaneously. Guided by the constituent tree and dependency tree, rich syntactic information is fully used in the model to build the sentiment-aware context for each aspect. In special, the multilayer attention mechanism and GCN are employed for learning to capture the correlation between words. By integrating syntactic information, this approach significantly refines the model’s technical performance.

First, considering the implicit assumption of traditional method, hybrid model (HM) is improved to calibrate the elastic deformation state of high arch dam. Second, the adaptive proportion selection and the neighborhood search strategy are applied to improve artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. The undetermined parameters of HM are optimized by the improved ABC. Third, the dangerous degrees of single-point deformation and multi-point deformation are characterized using HM analysis results and information entropy. On this basis, the progressive diagnosis criteria are constructed based on probability principle. Finally, two case studies are conducted to validate the proposed methodology. The analysis results demonstrate that the performance of HM is better than that of the statistical model (SM); the improved ABC promotes the HM performance; and the progressive diagnosis criteria compared with the traditional confidence interval criteria have stricter probabilistic and physical meanings.

Adjusting passive suspension parameters to optimize ride comfort and hunting stability simultaneously in varied extreme operational conditions poses a significant challenge for high-speed trains. This research integrates high-order displacement-dependent nonlinear damping into the secondary lateral suspension, drawing on insights from field test data. We analyze three typical hunting motion bifurcations: carbody hunting and both subcritical and supercritical bifurcations of bogie hunting. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that (a) the adaptive nonlinear damping narrows the unstable speed range and reduces the amplitude of the limit cycle in carbody hunting, (b) while it does not increase the critical speed for supercritical bogie hunting bifurcation, it substantially reduces the amplitude of the limit cycle, and (c) it increases the nonlinear critical speed for subcritical bogie hunting bifurcation, with the potential to alter the bifurcation from subcritical to supercritical, which holds considerable practical significance. Implementing such nonlinear damping directly through passive structure is challenging. Therefore, in view of this underactuated control problem, the constraint-following control is applied in the active suspension system to inherit the benefits of adaptive nonlinear damping. The simulation results show that the proposed active suspension system can effectively suppress the abnormal vibration caused by hunting motions. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Therefore each set of molecules with a particular conformation in the pure state can be regarded as a distinguishable subclass of rigid molecules.

The present study (n = 802) aimed to test that assumption by investigating the impact of messages highlighting the contributions of women researchers to two STEM fields, (mathematics and biology) on the perception of those fields among high school students and comparing it to the impact of analogous messages concerning three nonSTEM fields. We found that these messages did not encourage women to participate in the respective academic fields, in STEM or otherwise. And more strongly they led both women and men to see that academic field as less interesting and worthy of study. We propose that the effect observed here, and previously not discussed in the literature, is the reverse of the well-known Matilda effect. If the Matilda effect consists in a tendency to ignore or downplay the academic contributions of women based on the assumption that only men can contribute real value to research, then what we observed in our study is that that same assumption apparently makes people think that if women excel in certain fields, then those fields must be less valuable than others.

In three different partitions of the phase plane, separated by two discontinuity lines, the map is defined by linear functions with the same Jacobian matrix, having two real eigenvalues, one of which is negative and one equal to 0. This leads to asymptotic dynamics that can belong to two or three critical lines. We show that when the basic fixed point is attracting, it may coexist with at most three attracting cycles. We have determined their existence regions, in the two-dimensional parameter plane, bounded by border collision bifurcation curves. At parameter values for which the basic fixed point is repelling, chaotic attractors may exist - either one that is symmetric with respect to the basic fixed point, or, if not symmetric, the symmetric one also exists. The homoclinic bifurcations of repelling cycles leading to the merging of chaotic attractors are commented by using the first return map on a suitable line. Moreover, four different kinds of homoclinic bifurcations of a saddle 2-cycle, leading to divergence of the generic trajectory, are determined. © The Author(s) 2024."

To promote the research process of ribonucleic acid function, this study is for analyzing the utilization of heuristic algorithms on the ground of fusion dynamic programming in predicting the secondary structure of ribonucleic acid. Research on novel use of tree models for RNA secondary structure comparison, and use heuristic algorithms to optimize the multi branch structure comparison of tree models. Firstly, this study utilized dynamic programming algorithms to construct a comparison matrix and successfully found the backtracking path in the matrix. Meanwhile, for ensuring that the structural information of ribonucleic acid is not lost during the comparative analysis process, the study applies the idea of heuristic algorithms to calculate the optimal comparison between multi branched loops. Finally, the weights are adjusted using neural network algorithms to predict the optimal alignment structure. The results showed that the fusion dynamic programming heuristic algorithm achieved generalization performance of 0.928, 0.856, 0.842, and 0.793 on the target base data test sets of humans, mice, yeast, and spotted fish, respectively. Compared with the SimTree algorithm, the generalization performance has been improved by 15.13 %, 27.38 %, 27.77 %, and 38.88 %, respectively. In summary, the application of heuristic algorithms integrating dynamic programming in predicting the secondary structure of ribonucleic acid has good predictive performance.

The performance of the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm, a popular feature extraction method for facial recognition, heavily relies on its parameter settings. Optimizing these parameters is crucial for achieving high accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to optimize HOG algorithm parameters and image size for facial recognition using a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)-based Bayesian optimization technique. This optimization process effectively harnesses machine learning performance metrics as the objective function, enabling the algorithm to adapt and enhance its feature extraction capabilities. Extensive experiments conducted across multiple databases, including the AR Face Database, Extended Yale B Database, ORL Database, Yale Face Database, and Facepix, have yielded an exceptional recognition accuracy of 100%. Our optimized handcrafted HOG algorithm highlights the potential and continued relevance of parameter-based handcrafted feature extraction algorithms in computer vision, particularly in resource-constrained environments or applications requiring interpretability. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

The co-infection of HIV and HTLV-I with the effect of Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) immune response is also important from epidemiological point of view. To identify the co-infection scenario of HIV and HTLV-I with the CTLs effect we proposed in this paper a six compartmental ODE-model with uninfected, HIV-infected, HTLV-I infected CD4+T cells and free HIV virus particles with HIV specific CTLs and HTLV-I specific CTLs. The rates of infection of the cases are considered here saturated type and proliferation rate of uninfected and HIV infected CD4+ T-cells are of logistic terms. To establish the well-posedness of the model we have shown that the solution of the proposed model is non-negative and bounded. We obtain the basic reproduction number which is the maximum of the HIV-related reproduction and the HTLV-I related reproduction number. Along with the disease free equilibrium point the system contains other seven endemic equilibrium points containing infection by single disease or both. Analytically, we establish the local and global stability conditions of the equilibrium points and also we establish that the system experiences transcritical bifurcation by the generation of only HIV or HTLV-I infected endemic equilibrium point. Using numerical simulations, we validate the theoretical results and found two infection paths, one initiating with HIV and other with HTLV-I, both cases ultimately become co-infected. Finally, using the optimal control analysis we found the optimal policy for treatment using AVR, RTI & PI for HIV or AZT for HTLV-I control and lastly concluded by some recommendations. © 2024 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS)"

The design of urban drainage system is challenging for its complex constraints and expensive individual evaluation. A kind of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm driven by both structural and empirical knowledge, called structural and empirical knowledge driven multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, is proposed in this paper. A novel tree-template-based encoding schema is proposed to extract the structural knowledge of urban drainage system. The population initialization method and genetic operators (i.e., crossover and mutation) are customized to handle the constraints among decision variables caused by the structure restriction of the urban drainage system. The radial basis function (RBF) model is employed to learn the empirical knowledge from the previous evolution process, and the RBF-based approximate evaluation is used to partially replace the expensive individual evaluation to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Besides, by combining the decomposition idea and the constrained dominance principle, the local constrained dominance principle is suggested to handle the constraints in decision space, which can effectively improve the defect that the constrained dominance principle is easy to fall into local optimum. Comprehensive experiments on two urban drainage system cases show the superiority of the proposed algorithm for the optimal urban drainage system design. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Numerous instances of thriving OEM remanufacturing can be observed, predominantly in the business-to-business domain. The significance of Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) in generating value and managing the recovery process is widely acknowledged within the supply chain industry. Manufacturing companies now have to come up with green supply chain and process design strategies in response to recent changes in environmental regulations. This study designates the specific features of circular closed-loop supply-chain design considering end-of-life products. Uncertainty in various aspects, such as acquisition, processing, and market stages, is impeding the progress of circular economies and also sustainable development in closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs). This has led to increased complexity in remanufacturing processes and decreased efficiency. To address this issue, the study proposes a comprehensive, integrative approach for establishing a sustainable CLSC network that adapts to fluctuating demand through a questionnaire analysis. Moreover, the study introduces a multi-objective optimization model for a dual-channel supply chain network, aiming to enhance the flow. This model considers both economic and environmental objectives to achieve a sustainable and efficient supply chain system. To determine the ideal circular closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network design, the research proposes linear programming model with mixed integer, where recovery can take place in one of three ways: through material recovery, component recovery, or product recovery. Numerous findings from a thorough analysis by data backup that inform CLSC managers of ways to improve product returns in terms of quantity and quality. To address the uncertainty problem, the research also developed the fuzzy credibility constraint technique with a Simulated Annealing algorithm. Using cutting-edge methods, it is explored and compared how sensitivity analysis results, the impact of altering the problem parameters, and the performance of the suggested model respectively. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

One of the turning points in students' educational trajectories likely to exacerbate boys' academic difficulties is students' enrolment in private or enriched school programmes, as boys are underrepresented in such programmes. Method: To better understand this gender imbalance, our research draws on a longitudinal design to examine whether grade 6 students' externalizing behaviours, school engagement and school grades in mathematics and language arts relate to secondary school programme attendance, among a sample size of 577 students (277 boys). Results: Path analysis showed that only language arts grades predicted enrolment in private or selective public programmes and contributed to boys' underrepresentation in these programmes.

Math walks are place-based walking tours where youths and facilitators critically examine and ask math-related questions about their environment. Method: Drawing on situated theories of learning and frameworks for understanding group participation, we examined how facilitators constrained or supported youths’ mathematical thinking as they participated in math walks at the local zoo. Results: Using interaction and stance analysis, we identified, analyzed, and compared three contrasting cases: In the first case, the facilitator may have overly constrained youths’ mathematical thinking by asking leading questions and not providing time for youths to discuss their personal interests. In the second case, the facilitator may have underly constrained youths’ mathematical thinking by allowing youths to ask too many new questions without refining or developing any one specific question. In the third case, the facilitator supported mathematical thinking by praising youths’ work, layering on mathematical terminology, and providing clear and actionable instructions for how youths could refine their mathematical questions. Conclusions: Findings support efforts to understand how adult facilitators can support youths in seeing mathematics within and asking mathematical questions about the world around them. © 2024 The Authors"

Nevertheless, there is a lack of reference on achievement goal orientation for academic buoyancy among students in Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) areas of Malaysia, especially for future workforce development. Hence, this study aims to examine the relationship between achievement goal orientation and academic buoyancy in mathematics achievement among FELDA students. This study employed a correlational research design to collect quantitative data via questionnaires from 462 students. The descriptive statistics indicated that the average academic buoyancy value was moderate. In addition, avoidance of mastery and performance had higher descriptive mean values than mastery approach and performance approach. Academic buoyancy was also found to be moderately positively associated with the mastery approach (r = 0.538), the performance approach (r = 0.411), and the performance avoidance orientation (r = 0.381). Mastery avoidance orientation exhibited the weakest positive relationship (r = 0.184). These findings shed light on how to foster students' achievement goal orientation in their ability to overcome academic setbacks. A sign of mastery avoidance had informed a need to focus on mastery of content for increasing academic buoyancy. © 2024, Semarak Ilmu Publishing. All rights reserved."

Parents' perfectionistic concerns had a direct negative link with children's mathematical abilities, an indirect link via approach motivation to learn mathematics, and an indirect link via avoidance motivation to learn mathematics. Conclusions: Early childhood practitioners are recommended to raise parents' awareness of how to communicate high-performance targets to children in a constructive manner. © 2024 British Psychological Society."

A dataset of both stiffened and unstiffened plate girders under patch loading are collected and used for training and testing to generate the proposed models. Firstly, the WERCS method is used to resample the training set to improve the performance of training data. After that, four ML models, including Gradient Boosted Tree (GTB), Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGB), Artificial neural network (ANN), and CATBoost regression (CAT) are employed. The hyperparameter of all above ML models are optimized by using ESOA algorithm to choose the best performance models. It was found that the WERCS influences considerably the performance of hybrid ML models, and the WERCS + ESOA + XGB model presents the best performance compared to others. The accuracy of the WERCS + ESOA + XGB model is validated by comparing its predictive results with the existing design codes and formulae. Additionally, the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) method is used to assess the importance and contributions of each input variable in the proposed model. This algorithm can explain the global and local effects of features with each range and create favourable foundations for practical designing. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool is developed to conveniently estimate both the patch loading resistance of longitudinally unstiffened and stiffened plate girders. A Python library has been developed and uploaded to PyPi for more convenient use without the need for accessing the source code. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Although significant progress has been made in this field, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the nature of such stable-to-unstable transition. Some studies reported a smooth and continuous instability transition in microchannels, interpreting this phenomenon as a supercritical bifurcation. Meanwhile, others have observed that the transition is subcritical, with rapid, stepwise evolution of the stable flame to FREI. This study aims to rigorously determine the transition character theoretically and numerically using a two-dimensional model with a precise resolution of the bifurcation parameter (flow velocity) near the critical point and gradual wall temperature ramp. The results indicate that the transition is a subcritical bifurcation with strong hysteresis. However, the amplitude of the limit cycle born in the bifurcation point could be small compared to FREI-like oscillations. Moreover, further development of the instability depends significantly on the channel width. In relatively wide channels, the stable regime transforms immediately into the extinction/ignition one with rapid growth in amplitude. In moderate channels, complex transitional dynamics were observed with an evident pulsating regime, which evolved into FREI through mixed-mode oscillations. In narrow channels, the amplitude of transitional pulsating flame becomes comparable to the fully-developed extinction/ignition cycles, and the bifurcation diagram has a continuous character with no significant jumps or discontinuities. Such qualitative variation of transition character provides a possible explanation for contradictory interpretations presented in the literature. Novelty and Significance Statement Currently, there is no consensus about the character of transition between the stable and extinction/ignition regimes in microchannels. Some studies have reported a continuous instability transition with an evident pulsating regime, interpreting it as a supercritical bifurcation, while others have observed subcritical bifurcation with a rapid transition. The novelty of this research lies in the rigorous determination of the bifurcation type and further instability development in microchannels of different widths based on an accurate simulation of flame dynamics near the critical point with very small steps of the flow velocity variation, along with the bifurcation theory. The study contributes to understanding the instability transition nature and may explain the different interpretations of the transitional phenomenon found in the literature. The results offer valuable insights for designing micro-scale and porous media combustion devices. © 2024 The Combustion Institute"

Whilst studies have demonstrated the positive effects of RPPs, potential challenges in establishing long-term and mutually beneficial RPPs have been reported. To understand these challenges, the present study explores dynamic changes in team interaction patterns and roles using Social Network Analysis (SNA), then employs qualitative analysis to elaborate the mechanisms underlying these changes and resulting outcomes. The visual and quantitative results of the SNA reveal that interaction patterns shifted from a researcher-centered (hierarchical) pattern to a decentralized pattern, with increasing numbers of participants exhibiting a higher level of activity and exchange over time across the four discussions in a RPP. As for role changes, researchers played more of a leading role in the first two discussions, while teachers played a more equal role in subsequent discussions. The qualitative findings identify some key factors that lead to the changes in interaction patterns and roles, including: the process of negotiating meaning through lesson study; the establishment of trust between participants; and a concern for how role changes may positively impact teachers' and researchers’ professional development. These findings thus offer insights into how to create more effective and long-lasting RPPs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Recently, air pollutant concentrations forecasting based on machine learning has been considerably advanced with the development of data-driven approaches. However, multi-source data constraints and architectural complexity in machine learning approaches limit the use of machine learning in actual scenarios. Herein we present a window-based multi-output gradient boosting regression tree (WM-GBRT) approach to predict air pollutant concentrations for the next 48 h at each monitoring station, considering air pollutant monitoring data, meteorological monitoring data, NECP-GFS data, and GEOS-CF data. The key innovation of our approach lies in the flexible input window configuration and the implementation of an multi-step independent strategy. The experiments were conducted in China and compared to existing data-driven baselines, we show that our approach achieved the superior performance in forecasting concentrations of six air pollutants, with a considerable improvement of 6.94 % (PM2.5), 12.3 % (PM10), 3.84 % (O3), 30.6 % (SO2), 9.84 % (NO2), and 93.9 % (CO) when compared to the second-best baselines.

The objective of this review is to establish how MSS researchers investigate the effect of MSS on students and what that impact is. Based on a predefined protocol, five databases, the proceedings of eight conferences, two previous MSS literature reviews’ reference lists, and six mathematics education or MSS networks’ websites and reports were searched for publications in English since 2000. A two-round screening process resulted in 148 publications being included in the review which featured research from 12 countries. Ten formats of MSS, seven data sources (e.g., surveys), and 14 types of data (e.g., institution attainment, usage data) were identified with a range of analysis methods. Potential biases in MSS research were also considered. The synthesised results and discussion of this review include the mostly positive impact of MSS, issues in MSS evaluation research thus far, and rich opportunities for collaboration. The role MSS has and can play in mathematics education research is highlighted, looking towards the future of MSS evaluation research. Future directions suggested include more targeted systematic reviews, rigorous study design development, and greater cross-disciplinary and international collaboration. © The Author(s) 2024."

Furthermore, non-prototypical figures are particularly important when teaching geometry, but teachers and pre-service teachers still have problems defining them. For these reasons, we investigated whether there were differences in the way that pre-service mathematics teachers constructed and selected definitions for prototypical and non-prototypical solids. In particular, the commognitive framework was employed to investigate the differences in the discourse of 33 pre-service secondary-school teachers when constructing and selecting definitions in task situations that involved prototypical and non-prototypical solids. Moreover, we studied if some commognitive conflicts appeared in task situations involving non-prototypical solids but not in similar task situations involving prototypical solids. The findings show some differences between the pre-service teachers’ discourses in both types of task situations. Additionally, some commognitive conflicts appeared only in task situations with non-prototypical solids. Lastly, we classified those commognitive conflicts. © 2024 The Authors"

The choice of the optimization objective determines the structure of the topology fins. In this paper, the topology generation process was analyzed using the mean temperature, the mean square deviation (MSD) of the mean temperature, and the multi-objective entropy depletion as the optimization objectives. In this way, a method for selecting the optimization objectives according to the design requirements was obtained. The multi-objective topological structure (Case 3) with uniform tree-shaped fins (Case 4) and gradient tree-shaped fins (Case 5) was applied to the LHS system, and the finite element analysis method was used to construct a mathematical model of the LHS system to comprehensively analyze the heat storage/release process. The results showed that the complete melting times for Case 3, Case 4, and Case 5 were 751 s, 1005 s, and 920 s, respectively. At 751 s, the average heat storage capacities for Case 3, Case 4, and Case 5 are 296.81 W, 216.94 W, and 238.92 W, respectively. Compared to Case 4, Case 3 decreased the complete melting time by 25.27 % and increased the average heat storage capacity by 36.82 %. At heat-releasing times of 500 s, 1000 s, 1500 s, and 2000 s, the maximum differences in liquid phase rates for the three models were 10.93 %, 11.97 %, 11.51 %, and 9.57 %, respectively. From the perspective of the field synergy, Case 3 showed a better heat transfer path and the optimal heat transfer effect considering the temperature, liquid phase rate, heat storage/release time, and heat storage/release capacity. In addition, the dimensionless criterion equation affecting the liquid phase rate was obtained by segmented fitting of the heat transfer process of the topology-optimized LHS system.

It was noted that the plate's initial deflection was perpendicular to its surface, resulting in asymmetry. The partial differential equation governing the plate's behavior was simplified to the one-degree-of-freedom Mathieu equation. The three methods have been used to analyze the system's dynamics: the FEM, the sampled-based method and path-following. The equivalence of the full model with the reduced one was confirmed by the researchers. It was found that the Mathieu equation was suitable for investigating the dynamics of the rectangular plate across various parameters and for studying the sensitivity to initial conditions. It is shown that the reduced model is very efficient for detecting ranges of multistability and bifurcations sequence. A good agreement is also observed for values of stress obtained from full and reduced models. © 2024 The Author(s)"

By rotating one of its clamped ends with controlled angular speed, we observe two snap-through transition paths among the multiple stable configurations of a ribbon in three-dimensional (3D) space; this is different from the classical snap-through of a two-dimensional (2D) bistable beam. Our theoretical model for the static bifurcation analysis is based on the Kirchhoff rod equations, and dynamical simulations are conducted using the Discrete Elastic Rods (DER) algorithm. The planar beam model is also employed for the asymptotic analysis of dynamic snap-through behaviors. The results show that, since the snap-through processes of both planar beams and 3D ribbons are governed by a saddle–node bifurcation, the same scaling law for the delay applies. We further demonstrate that by controlling the velocity of end-rotation, distinct snap-through pathways can be realized. In this way, we may selectively skip specific modes and, moreover, particular final modes can be strategically achieved. Through a parametric study using numerical simulations, we construct general phase diagrams for both mode skipping and selection of snapping ribbons. The work serves as a benchmark for future investigations on dynamic snap-through of thin elastic structures and provides guidelines for the novel design of intelligent mechanical systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, vulnerability detection is made difficult by the existence of some different and vulnerability-unrelated statements between codes with the same vulnerability pattern, as well as the small differences between vulnerable and fixed non-vulnerable codes. To address these challenges, we believe that more attention needs to be paid to some core syntactic and semantic information about vulnerabilities, which can help models more accurately identify vulnerable code. Hence, we propose a novel code-similarity-based vulnerability detection approach named SVulDetector. First, it contains a code representation, called Slice Composite Graphs (SCGs), which can represent rich syntactic and semantic information related to vulnerable statements while minimizing the interference from similar vulnerability irrelevant information as much as possible. Next, a tree-based attention mechanism is used to highlight certain key syntactic information in vulnerable code and fixed non-vulnerable code. Finally, SVulDetector highlights key vulnerable node information in the graph-based code representation via a weighted graph embedding mechanism. We extensively evaluated SVulDetector on an improved real-world dataset using both two-class and multi-class vulnerability detection tasks, and the proposed SVulDetector outperforms existing state-of-the-art detection methods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Recent studies on the critical demands posed by statistical information in media highlight the importance of the communicative component of statistical literacy, which involves students’ ability to react to statistical information. By adapting Habermas’ construct of communicative rationality into a framework for statistical literacy, a novel analytical tool is presented that can provide theoretical insights as well as in-depth empirical insights into students’ communication about statistical information. Central to the framework are the four validity claims of comprehensibility, truth, truthfulness, and rightness which interlocutors need to address to engage in statistical communication. The empirical usefulness of the framework is shown by presenting the results of a study that examined Grade 5 students’ responses to fictional arguments about the decline of Arctic sea ice. The Habermas-based framework not only reveals that complex evaluations of statistical arguments can take place even in Grade 5 but also shows that students’ evaluations vary greatly. Empirical results include a content-specific differentiation of validity claims through inductively identified sub-categories as well as a description of differences in the students’ uses of validity claims. © The Author(s) 2024."

This task holds immense importance in enhancing research efficiency, aiding decision-making processes, and facilitating scientific evaluations. For this, the scientific community has put forth a wide array of parameters to identify the most influential researchers. These include citation count, total publication count, hybrid methodologies, the h-index, and also its extended or modified versions. But still, there is a lack of consensus on a single optimal parameter for identifying the most influential author. In this study, we introduce a novel index derived from learning hidden patterns within the mathematics field dataset, comprising data from 1050 researchers evenly split between awardees and non-awardees. Initially, we ranked selected parameters by assessing their values for individual researchers, identifying the top five parameters that most frequently placed awardees within the top 100 records. Additionally, we employed deep learning techniques to identify the top five influential parameters from the initially selected set. Subsequently, we evaluated the disjointness between the results produced by these parameters. To further refine our analysis, we assessed seven different statistical models for combining the top disjoint pair to retain the maximum properties of both parameters. The study’s findings revealed that the gf and k indices exhibited a 0.96 percent disjointness ratio, establishing them as the highest disjoint pair. Moreover, the geometric mean demonstrated a 0.87 percent average impact in retaining the properties of the top disjoint pair, surpassing the other seven models. As a result of this study, we propose a new index obtained by taking the geometric mean of the top disjoint pair which increase the result by 12% as compared to existing best performing individual index performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024."

Recently, there has been a growing emphasis on techniques leveraging Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN). However, there are several challenges associated with current approaches: (1) Due to the inherent transitivity of CGN, training inevitably entails the acquisition of irrelevant semantic information. (2) Existing methodologies heavily depend on the dependency tree, neglecting to consider the contextual structure of the sentence. (3) Another limitation of the majority of methods is their failure to account for the interactions occurring between different aspects. In this study, we propose a Clause Graph Transformer Structure (CGT) to alleviate these limitations. Specifically, CGT comprises three modules. The preprocessing module extracts aspect clauses from each sentence by bi-directionally traversing the constituent tree, reducing reliance on syntax trees and extracting semantic information from the perspective of clauses. Additionally, we assert that a word's vector direction signifies its underlying attitude in the semantic space, a feature often overlooked in recent research. Without the necessity for additional parameters, we introduce the Clause Attention encoder (CA-encoder) to the clause module to effectively capture the directed cross-correlation coefficient between the clause and the target aspect. To enhance the representation of the target component, we propose capturing the connections between various aspects. In the inter-aspect module, we intricately design a Balanced Attention encoder (BA-encoder) that forms an aspect sequence by navigating the extracted phrase tree. To effectively capture the emotion of implicit components, we introduce a Top-K Attention Graph Convolutional Network (KA-GCN). Our proposed method has showcased state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance through experiments conducted on four widely used datasets. Furthermore, our model demonstrates a significant improvement in the robustness of datasets subjected to disturbances. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Aims: To examine the extent to which children's earlier knowledge of cross-notation magnitude predicted subsequent performance in fraction addition and subtraction as well as fraction multiplication and division longitudinally. Sample: Three hundred and fifty-four Chinese children (Mage = 112.1 months). Methods: During the first wave of assessment, a range of cognitive abilities of children were measured, including within-notation fraction and decimal magnitude comparisons, whole-number arithmetic fluency, non-verbal intelligence, attentive behaviours, counting recall, word-level reading, and phonological awareness. Twelve months later, the same children were assessed again with two tasks of fraction arithmetic: fraction addition and subtraction as well as fraction multiplication and division. Results and Conclusions: Multiple linear regressions showed that within-notation fraction and decimal magnitude knowledge predicted fraction addition and subtraction longitudinally, after the effects of working memory, nonverbal intelligence, language skills, attentive behaviour, and whole-number arithmetic were controlled. Cross-notation magnitude knowledge made independent contributions to fraction addition and subtraction longitudinally beyond the influence of within-notation fraction and decimal magnitude knowledge and other covariates. However, within-notation fraction and decimal magnitude knowledge were not associated with fraction multiplication and division, whereas cross-notation magnitude knowledge remained a unique predictor. These findings suggest that it may be useful to incorporate cross-notation knowledge in the assessments of children's mathematics abilities and teaching. © 2024 British Psychological Society."

We present a study of the coupling between radiation pressure and the gravitational perturbation due to polar flattening. Removing the short-period terms via perturbation theory yields a time-dependent two-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian, depending on one physical and one dynamical parameter. While the reduced model is non-integrable in general, assuming coplanar orbits (i.e., both Spacecraft and Sun on the equator) results in an integrable invariant manifold. We discuss the qualitative features of the coplanar dynamics, and find three regions of the parameters space characterized by different regimes of the reduced flow. For each regime, we identify the fixed points and their character. The fixed points represent frozen orbits, configurations for which the long-term perturbations cancel out to the order of the theory. They are advantageous from the point of view of station keeping, allowing the orbit to be maintained with minimal propellant consumption. We complement existing studies of the coplanar dynamics with a more rigorous treatment, deriving the generating function of the canonical transformation that underpins the use of averaged equations. Furthermore, we obtain an analytical expression for the bifurcation lines that separate the regions with different qualitative flow. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024."

However, detailed understanding of when and how students are most likely to lose motivation, as well as whether motivational trajectories differ across contexts, is lacking. Accordingly, we investigated trajectories of expectancy, task values, and perceived costs in four introductory STEM courses (N = 2,104). Latent change score models revealed nuanced patterns of change, indicating average motivational declines in expectancy and task values and average increases in cost perceptions observed in prior research tend to occur primarily at the beginning of the semester. Motivational trajectories also differed in the shape and timing of mean changes across the four STEM courses, suggesting motivational loss trends may not be universal. Variation in trajectories also related to course performance and major persistence, with different motivational beliefs playing different roles at various times in the semester. Findings highlighted the importance of early course performance in predicting motivational change, as well as the importance of motivational changes for short- and long-term outcomes. Findings underscore the contextualized nature of motivational constructs, as both change patterns and relations to correlates differed across settings, indicating a need for researchers to carefully consider how samples are aggregated and further uncover contextual features that shape motivation. Overall, our study findings add essential understanding of motivational strengths and needs in real-world classroom contexts, with implications for the design and timing of intervention for instructors by examining what developmental patterns are common across settings and which are more particular to specific settings. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Math formula recognition may be understood as a generalization of text recognition: formulas represent mathematical statements using a two dimensional arrangement of symbols on writing lines that are organized hierarchically. This survey provides an overview of techniques published in the last decade, including those taking input from handwritten strokes (i.e., ‘online’, as captured by a pen/touch device), raster images (i.e., ‘offline,’ from pixels), or both. Traditionally, HMEs were recognized by performing four structural pattern recognition tasks in separate steps: (1) symbol segmentation, (2) symbol classification, (3) spatial relationship classification, and (4) structural analysis, which identifies the arrangement of symbols on writing lines (e.g., in a Symbol Layout Tree (SLT) or LaTeX string). Recently, encoder–decoder neural network models and Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches have greatly increased HME recognition accuracy. These newer approaches perform all recognition tasks simultaneously, and utilize contextual features across tasks (e.g., using neural self-attention models). We also discuss evaluation techniques and benchmarks, and explore some implicit dependencies among the four key recognition tasks. Finally, we identify limitations of current systems, and present suggestions for future work, such as using two-dimensional language models rather than the one-dimensional models commonly used in encoder–decoder models. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

This study presents EduCross, a novel framework devised to enhance CMR within multimodal educational slides, which is a domain in which traditional retrieval systems fall short. Recognizing the imperative for a system that is tailored to the educational context, EduCross integrates dual adversarial bipartite hypergraph learning, harnessing the capabilities of generative adversarial networks with figure-text dual channels. This powerful combination facilitates robust bidirectional mapping, allowing for the precise association of figures with their descriptive spoken language segments and ensuring a comprehensive CMR experience. Specifically, we develop framelet-based deep bipartite hypergraph neural networks that effectively manage the high-order relationships between diverse educational content types and various types of slide figures. Our experimental results underscore the superior performance of EduCross, demonstrating its effectiveness through the use of the real Multimodal Lecture Presentations dataset that mirrors authentic educational settings.

This article examines the relationship between the environment and pedagogy from the perspective of primary school teachers in the context of teaching mathematics. We interviewed 26 teachers from 10 Finnish ILEs and did a thematic analysis. The relationship between the environment and pedagogy forms a complex network of entangled tensions between teacher's inner space, community's social space and physical space. When the tensions between these spaces were resolved in a positive way, ILEs enabled pedagogy that diversified mathematics education, improved student cohesion and teachers' well-being at work. However, the ILEs' transformation process often appears to be left unfinished, leading to unsuccessful resolution of tensions.

Technological strategies like the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing have been explored for real-time monitoring and these interventions may be investigated to improve indoor air quality (IAQ) and human health. This review article explores the prospects of IoT and smart environments for the improvement of indoor living conditions through automation. Some specific interference like sensors, air pollution simulations and modeling, the concept of smart ventilation, and fuzzy logic controllers (FLC) have been elaborated with pieces of evidence taken from previously published studies in leading indexing databases. Furthermore, some automated health risk assessment tools like the Human exposure model (HEM), Integrated Fuzzy-stochastic modeling (IFSM), and proximity and interpolation models have also been described. The findings suggested that IoT-based gadgets require ambient intelligence capabilities for ambient assisted living (AAL). The studies showed that innovations in technology like sensors and modeling techniques may yield crucial information on pollution exposure enabling long-term and sustainable predictions. However, efficient AAL systems may also face challenges in designing interfaces, usability, and accessibility. Although IoT can aid in mimicking real-world scenarios, nevertheless its-micro spatial scale application requires thorough investigation for reliable information extraction. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

Specifically, we deal with piecewise-constant weight functions in front of the nonlinearity with an arbitrary number κ≥1 of vanishing regions. We study, from an analytic and numerical point of view, the number of positive solutions, depending on the value of a parameter λ and on κ. Our main results are twofold. On the one hand, we study analytically the behavior of the solutions, as λ↓−∞, in the regions where the weight vanishes. Our result leads us to conjecture the existence of 2κ+1−1 solutions for sufficiently negative λ. On the other hand, we support such a conjecture with the results of numerical simulations which also shed light on the structure of the global bifurcation diagrams in λ and the profiles of positive solutions. Finally, we give additional numerical results suggesting that high multiplicity also holds true for a much larger class of weights, even arbitrarily close to situations where there is uniqueness of positive solutions. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Its effectiveness heavily relies on the iterative solver, which in turn depends crucially on the performance of the preconditioner. Although a leaf-based preconditioner has proven effective in the single domain FMBEM (SFB), it encounters challenges in the multi-domain FMBEM (MFB). To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a cell renumbering algorithm to construct a leaf-based preconditioner for MFB. This algorithm renumbers the cells in the tree structure, taking into account the influence of the tree structure's traversal order on the coefficient matrix distribution. This renumbering enables the generation of a leaf-based preconditioner matrix for MFB, with specialized processing for sub-matrix blocks associated with the interface, accommodating both aligned and misaligned cells on both sides of the interface. In cases where the tree structure is not aligned, each interface-related submatrix may correspond to two or more leaves, resulting in a larger matrix size and increased computational cost for preconditioner calculations. To mitigate this computational burden, this paper proposes an improved cell renumbering scheme, which directly manipulates the index set to align the cell indices within the tree structure, thereby reducing computational costs. The utilization of this renumbered preconditioner in MFB not only achieves fast convergence of iterative solvers but also retains the advantages as in SFB. Through these techniques, this paper proposes a new approach to MFB. Numerical results presented in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of the proposed cell renumbering algorithm and preconditioner for MFB. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

We report on the implementation of a two-part series of nudges designed to improve students' engagement with and performance on mastery-based assignments in high-enrollment, introductory undergraduate courses. Students received one or two email-based nudges for each assignment, providing both decision information and decision assistance. Delivered via email by a digital coaching system that provides tailored support to students, we evaluated the effectiveness of viewing versus not viewing these personalized nudges across introductory courses in mathematics, computer science and engineering over five terms at our large, research-intensive university. We used multilevel modelling with a sample of 30,693 assignment scores nested within 79 assignments and 5349 undergraduate students to explore the relationship between students' viewing the nudges and their scores while controlling for performance in other courses and students' baseline proclivities to read email from the coaching system. We find that viewing versus not viewing nudges is significantly related to improved outcomes. Viewing the first of the two-part nudge series is associated with a 3% increase in scores on average. Importantly, we found a significant interaction with prior academic performance such that students with the lowest average academic performance across all courses are predicted to benefit the most—up to 9%—from nudging. Positive impacts are observed in most courses where nudges were implemented and are found to be most impactful for later versus earlier assignments within a term. We discuss the implications of these results for supporting students' decision-making within mastery-based assignment schemes and suggest future research for tailored nudges to support student success. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Nudges are known to be broadly effective, but heterogeneity is observed especially in education where the research base is relatively limited. Mastery-based grading is an alternative approach to grading that, among other features, emphasizes learning through an explicit feedback cycle of struggle and revision without penalty. What this paper adds This study assesses the effectiveness of personalized nudges in the context of mastery-based grading in undergraduate STEM courses. We examined the efficacy of viewing versus not viewing nudges in the real learning settings of three STEM courses enrolling more than 5000 students. We found the nudges to be effective overall, correlated with improvements of approximately 3% in students' assignment scores and most impactful for students with the lowest average academic performance. Implications for practice and/or policy Nudging by email or text message has a low overhead cost and yet may provide materially significant gains in students' assessment scores. Nudges can be effectively targeted to specific subsets of students and tailored based on students' prior and concurrent learning analytics data. © 2024 The Authors.

The governing equation of CSWCNT is presented considering the axial thermo-magnetic load and the surface effect. By employing the Galerkin decomposition approximation method along with the admissible beam shape function satisfying the cantilevered beam boundary conditions, the nonlinear partial differential equation of the system is reduced to a nonlinear ordinary differential equation and numeric integration procedures are used to solve it. By considering the non-dimensional damping, cubic and quadratic terms, and amplitude of external force as controlling parameters, the bifurcation diagram and the largest Lyapunov exponent are employed to distinguish the chaotic, periodic, and quasi-periodic critical parameters of the curved CNT dynamics and validate the predicted results. Also, the phase plane and Poincare map for these critical parameters are provided. The results show that decreasing values of damping coefficient and quadratic term leads to quasi-periodic or chaotic motion, while system has periodic behaviour for smaller values of the external force and nonlinear cubic term. Also, magnetic field intensity and length of the CSWCNT help preventing the chaotic motion. Furthermore, adverse effects of higher values of temperature change, flow velocity and its correction factor are seen based on the obtained results. © 2024"

Using data from 104 U.S. kindergartners, we measured whether children's estimates were correctly sequenced across trials and correctly positioned relative to given benchmarks within trials at two time points. For both time points, we found that each ordinal error measure revealed a distinct pattern of data distribution, providing opportunities to tap into different aspects of children's ordinal understanding. Furthermore, children who made fewer ordinal errors scored higher on the Test of Early Mathematics Ability and showed greater improvement on their interval understanding of numbers as reflected by a larger reduction of percentage of absolute error from Time 1 to Time 2. The findings suggest that our number line measures reveal individual differences in children's ordinal understanding of numbers, and that such understanding may be a precursor to their interval understanding and later mathematics performance. © 2024 The Author(s)"

To reduce this influence (e.g., in testing situations), studies on linguistic simplification focus on modifying linguistic features. These studies show little or no effect on increasing test performance. An open question is whether a quantitative–exploratory approach with texts from a specific domain can be an additional model for reducing the linguistic influence on mathematical tasks. To answer this question, generalized linear mixed models were used to determine the effects of linguistic factors, the requirements of the items, and the effects of linguistic factors when differentiating the requirements of the items, while controlling for further person- and item-related effects.

In this paper, we develop an exact approach for the integrated layout and cable routing problem of onshore wind farm planning using the Quota Steiner tree problem. Applying a novel transformation on a known directed cut formulation, reduction techniques, and heuristics, we design an exact solver that makes large problem instances solvable and outperforms generic MIP solvers. In selected regions of Germany, the trade-offs between minimizing costs and landscape impact of onshore wind farm siting are investigated. Although our case studies show large trade-offs between the objective criteria of cost and landscape impact, small burdens on one criterion can significantly improve the other criteria. In addition, we demonstrate that contrary to many approaches for exclusive turbine siting, grid integration must be simultaneously optimized to avoid excessive costs or landscape impacts in the course of a wind farm project. Our novel problem formulation and the developed solver can assist planners in decision-making and help optimize wind farms in large regions in the future. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The analysis revealed that the flexible grading policy was utilized differently depending on course characteristics, with core courses and subjects like mathematics, chemistry, and economics having higher rates of usage. Additionally, sociodemographic and academic profile factors led to varying degrees of utilization, with males, urban students, freshmen, and non-STEM majors using the policy more frequently. Furthermore, the analysis suggested that the policy may have disadvantaged some students as they struggled in subsequent courses after using the pass option. Several implications and directions for future research are discussed. © International Association of Universities 2023."

STEM labs, which are similar to makerspaces, can be defined as physical spaces where students can learn integrated skills and content through hands-on experiences (Roy and Love, 2017). While STEM labs can be found in a variety of settings (e.g., school libraries, museums, or even theme parks), the industry-situated STEM lab that is the focus of this study is a unique application of such a learning environment in an informal space within a manufacturing facility. However, the aim for this specific space is to offer local students an opportunity to see manufacturing, the people that work there, and the skills that might be necessary to pursue a future career in the various aspects of this industry. This type of career awareness and preparation initiative has become an area of interest for manufacturers as they continue to face increasing challenges with attracting employees and confronting negative, potentially outdated, perceptions of manufacturing-related careers. That being said, this research will not attempt to justify the STEM lab initiative, but will instead provide a critical view of this novel context and this type of informal learning environment. This research objective was pursued by interviewing key industry stakeholders and analyzing an existing dataset—consisting of both student surveys and drawing tests—collected by the host manufacturer over the first year of the lab’s operation. By triangulating the data gathered from stakeholder interviews and both student surveys and drawing tests, which were collected before and after their experience with the STEM lab at the manufacturing facilities, this research sheds light on the challenges that similar industry-situated learning environments might face, as well as provides opportunities to potentially enhance the experience from both the student and industry perspective. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023."

When there are significant differences in the permeability of each layer, an interlayer contradiction arises that can impact the recovery efficiency. After a number of tests and the establishment of a mathematical model, the effects of permeability contrast on oil production for water flooding were revealed. In the meantime, the developed mathematical model was solved using the Buckley–Lever seepage equation. Ultimately, the accuracy of the established model was confirmed by comparing the simulated outcomes of the mathematical model with the experimental results. The findings indicate that when permeability contrast increases, the production ratio of the high-permeability layer will improve. This is primarily due to the low-permeability layer’s production contribution rate decreasing. The accuracy of the established model is ensured by an error of less than 5% between the results of the experiment and the simulation. When the permeability contrast is less than three, the low-permeability layer can be effectively used for three-layer commingled production. However, when the permeability contrast exceeds six, the production coefficient of the low-permeability layer will be less than 5%, which has a significant impact on the layer’s development. © 2024 by the authors."

A t-spanner of G is a spanning subgraph of G in which the distance between any pair of vertices is at most t times its distance in G. We address two problems on spanners. The first one, known as the minimumt-spanner problem (MinSt), seeks in a connected graph a t-spanner with the smallest possible number of edges. In the second one, called minimum cost treet-spanner problem (MCTSt), the input graph has costs assigned to its edges and seeks a t-spanner that is a tree with minimum cost. It is an optimization version of the treet-spanner problem (TreeSt), a decision problem concerning the existence of a t-spanner that is a tree. MinSt is known to be NP-hard for every t≥2. On the other hand, TreeSt admits a polynomial-time algorithm for t≤2 and is NP-complete for t≥4; but its complexity for t=3 remains open. We focus on the class of subcubic graphs. First, we show that for such graphs MinS3 can be solved in polynomial time. These results yield a practical polynomial algorithm for TreeS3 that is of a combinatorial nature. We also show that MCTS2 can be solved in polynomial time. To obtain this last result, we prove a complete linear characterization of the polytope defined by the incidence vectors of the tree 2-spanners of a subcubic graph. A recent result showing that MinS3 on graphs with maximum degree at most 5 is NP-hard, together with the current result on subcubic graphs, leaves open only the complexity of MinS3 on graphs with maximum degree 4. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

An algorithm was proposed for the coordination of robots in cooperative tasks, along with a Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) path planner for obstacle avoidance. The proposed system proved effective in transferring objects between robots and in handling various scenarios of variable complexity without collisions. The implementation of advanced trajectory planning and coordination algorithms significantly improves the adaptability and autonomy of robotic systems, allowing robots to predict and react to the movements of their counterparts and changes in the environment in real time. This capability is crucial for maintaining a safe and efficient work environment. The importance of synchronization and effective communication between robots is highlighted to avoid collisions and optimize trajectories and cycle times. All tests were conducted in virtual environments, allowing for the evaluation and refinement of the performance of the robots’ performance under controlled conditions. The positive results obtained in the simulations suggest that the system is well suited for future practical implementation in industrial and manufacturing applications, such as chemical handling, collaborative welding, quality inspection, among others.

This study focuses on Yulin City, a typical arid region located on the Loess Plateau in northwestern China. By constructing an evaluation index system for regional WRCC and combining an improved fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model with the TOPSIS evaluation model, a comprehensive WRCC evaluation model is established. Additionally, Geodetector is used to explore the main driving factors behind the evolution of regional WRCC. This multidimensional analytical framework aims to deeply analyze the dynamic evolution trends of WRCC and the driving mechanisms of different factors in its spatiotemporal changes. The results indicate that (1) from 2011 to 2020, the overall WRCC of Yulin City showed a trend of positive improvement, with Shenmu, Yuyang, and Fugu areas performing the best, and by 2020, more than half of the counties had achieved Grade 3 or above; (2) the spatial variability of WRCC in Yulin City was more significant than its temporal changes; and (3) in terms of driving mechanisms, the northern six counties gradually shifted from traditional economic-driven factors to ecological and environmental drivers, whereas the southern six counties remained constrained by economic factors. Overall, water resource factors remain the primary driving force for the socio-economic development and environmental sustainability of the entire Yulin City.

Challenges in this space include detecting unknown attacks, adapting to changes in the data stream such as changes in underlying behavior, the human cost of labeling data to retrain the machine learning model and the processing and memory constraints of a real-time data stream. Failure to manage the aforementioned factors could result in missed attacks, degraded detection performance, unnecessary expense or delayed detection times. This research proposes a new semi-supervised network data stream anomaly detection method, Split Active Learning Anomaly Detector (SALAD), which combines our novel Adaptive Anomaly Threshold and Stochastic Anomaly Threshold with Fading Factor methods. A novel Reconstruction Error based Distance from Threshold strategy is proposed and evaluated as part of an active stream framework to demonstrate reduction in labeling costs. The proposed methods are evaluated with the KDD Cup 1999, and UNSW-NB15 data sets, using the scikit-multiflow framework. Results demonstrated that the proposed SALAD method offered equivalent performance to full labeled and alternative Naïve Bayes (NB) and Hoeffding Adaptive Tree (HAT) methods, with a labeling budget of just 20%, significantly reducing the required human expertise to annotate the network data. Processing times of the SALAD method were demonstrated to be significantly lower than NB and HAT methods, allowing for greatly improved responsiveness to attacks occurring in real time. © 2024 The Authors"

A common problem in constructing routes for data packets to be successfully transferred from a source to a number of destinations is the multicast routing problem. Frequent routing problems usually include a minimum average delay from source to destination, resource usage costs, load on the network, and performance on the network. This problem requires optimization in order to produce optimal solutions for each problem. This problem can usually be solved using minimum or maximum Quality of Service (QoS) parameters, but the solution does not always provide optimal user network resources. In this study, optimality criteria or explicit reservation solutions will be used, which are developed with a mixture of linear programming that aims to minimize resources including time, cost, and bandwidth so that all routing from one or more data sources to destinations can be minimized. Mixed-linear integer programming is used to build multicast routing optimization problems so that the proposed model uses available resources more efficiently.  © 2024 Author(s)."

Unfitted (also known as embedded or immersed) finite element methods offer a significant advantage in dealing with complex geometries, eliminating the need for generating unstructured body-fitted meshes. However, current unfitted finite elements on nonlinear geometries are restricted to implicit (possibly high-order) level set geometries.

For the geometrical discretization, we propose a novel algorithm to generate quadratures for the bulk and surface integration on nonlinear polytopes required to compute all the terms in unfitted finite element methods. The algorithm relies on a nonlinear triangulation of the boundary, a kd-tree refinement of the surface cells that simplify the nonlinear intersections of surface and background cells to simple cases that are diffeomorphically equivalent to linear intersections, robust polynomial root-finding algorithms and surface parameterization techniques. We prove the correctness of the proposed algorithm. We have successfully applied this algorithm to simulate partial differential equations with unfitted finite elements on nonlinear domains described by computer-aided design models, demonstrating the robustness of the geometric algorithm and showing high-order accuracy of the overall method. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

This study proposes a metro flood risk assessment approach by combining urban flood inundation model, random forest algorithm (RF), and triangular fuzzy number based analytic hierarchy process (TFNAHP). The evaluation indicators are selected based on the theory of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, which are quantified through urban flood inundation model and geographic information system (GIS) technology. To solve the subjectivity of determining indicator weights, the data-driven RF algorithm is applied to identify indicator importance and create fuzzy judgment matrices of AHP. Moreover, the triangular fuzzy number is integrated with AHP to handle uncertain evaluation information. Taking the metro system in Zhengzhou, China as a case study, the flood risk is assessed for both metro line buffer zones and metro stations. The high-risk areas comprise more than 30 % of the study area. The assessment result is consistent with the historical flood condition. Furthermore, the proposed approach is more effective and suitable for metro flood risk assessment than the traditional AHP method. This study offers a new way for metro flood risk assessment and provides support for flood prevention in metro systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

In this article, we present an alternative novel technique by unveiling a new connection between triangulations of point configurations and MB integrals, to compute the latter. To make it ready to use, we have implemented our new method in the Mathematica package mbconichulls.wl, an already existing software dedicated to the analytic evaluation of MB integrals using conic hulls. The triangulation method is remarkably faster than the conic hull approach and can thus be used for the calculation of higher-fold MB integrals, as we show here by testing our code on the case of the off-shell massless scalar one-loop N-point Feynman integral up to N=15, for which the MB representation has 104 folds. Among other examples of applications, we present new simpler solutions for the off-shell one-loop massless conformal hexagon and two-loop double-box Feynman integrals, as well as for some complicated 8-fold MB integrals contributing to the hard diagram of the two-loop hexagon Wilson loop in general kinematics.  © 2024 authors.

Bifurcation detection in intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) images plays a significant role in guiding optimal revascularization strategies for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We propose a bifurcation detection method using vision transformer (ViT) based deep learning in IVOCT. Approach. Instead of relying on lumen segmentation, the proposed method identifies the bifurcation image using a ViT-based classification model and then estimate bifurcation ostium points by a ViT-based landmark detection model. Main results. By processing 8640 clinical images, the Accuracy and F1-score of bifurcation identification by the proposed ViT-based model are 2.54% and 16.08% higher than that of traditional non-deep learning methods, are similar to the best performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based methods, respectively. The ostium distance error of the ViT-based model is 0.305 mm, which is reduced 68.5% compared with the traditional non-deep learning method and reduced 24.81% compared with the best performance of CNNs based methods. The results also show that the proposed ViT-based method achieves the highest success detection rate are 11.3% and 29.2% higher than the non-deep learning method, and 4.6% and 2.5% higher than the best performance of CNNs based methods when the distance section is 0.1 and 0.2 mm, respectively. Significance. The proposed ViT-based method enhances the performance of bifurcation detection of IVOCT images, which maintains a high correlation and consistency between the automatic detection results and the expert manual results.

In many contexts, we assume that some vertices of a graph G are contaminated initially, before the process starts. By the q-forcing rule, a contaminated vertex having at most q uncontaminated neighbors enforces all the neighbors to become contaminated, while by the p-percolation rule, an uncontaminated vertex becomes contaminated if at least p of its neighbors are contaminated. If given a set S of initially contaminated vertices all vertices eventually become contaminated when continuously applying the q-forcing rule (respectively the p-percolation rule), S is called a q-forcing set (respectively, a p-percolating set) in G. In this paper, we consider sets S that are at the same time q-forcing sets and p-percolating sets, and call them (p,q)-spreading sets. Given positive integers p and q, the minimum cardinality of a (p,q)-spreading set in G is a (p,q)-spreading number, σ(p,q)(G), of G. While q-forcing sets have been studied in a dozen of papers, the decision version of the corresponding graph invariant has not been considered earlier, and we fill the gap by proving its NP-completeness. This, in turn, enables us to prove the NP-completeness of the decision version of the (p,q)-spreading number in graphs for an arbitrary choice of p and q. Again, for every p∈N and q∈N∪{∞}, we find a linear-time algorithm for determining the (p,q)-spreading number of a tree, where in the case p≥2 we apply Riedl's algorithm from [Largest and smallest minimal percolating sets in trees, Electron. J. Combin. 19 (2012) Paper 64] on p-percolation in trees. In addition, we present a lower and an upper bound on the (p,q)-spreading number of a tree and characterize extremal families of trees.

We present a new and arguably simple matching-based method for the well-known special case of leaf-to-leaf instances. Combining our work with prior techniques, we readily obtain a (4/3+ε)-approximation for Leaf-to-Leaf CAP by returning the better of our solution and one of an existing method. Prior to our work, a 4/3-guarantee was only known for Leaf-to-Leaf TAP instances on trees of height 2. Moreover, when combining our technique with a recently introduced stack analysis approach, which is part of the above-mentioned 1.393-approximation, we can further improve the approximation factor to 1.29, obtaining for the first time a factor below 43 for a nontrivial class of TAP/CAP instances. © The Author(s) 2023."

Because most of the current global path planning only considers the shortest path, it is difficult to meet the articulated steering tractor operation needs in the orchard environment and address other issues, so this paper proposes a hybrid algorithm of an improved bidirectional search A* algorithm and improved differential evolution genetic algorithm(AGADE). First, the integrated priority function and search method of the traditional A* algorithm are improved by adding weight influence to the integrated priority, and the search method is changed to a bidirectional search. Second, the genetic algorithm fitness function and search strategy are improved; the fitness function is set as the path tree row center offset factor; the smoothing factor and safety coefficient are set; and the search strategy adopts differential evolution for cross mutation. Finally, the shortest path obtained by the improved bidirectional search A* algorithm is used as the initial population of an improved differential evolution genetic algorithm, optimized iteratively, and the optimal path is obtained by adding kinematic constraints through a cubic B-spline curve smoothing path. The convergence of the AGADE hybrid algorithm and GA algorithm on four different maps, path length, and trajectory curve are compared and analyzed through simulation tests. The convergence speed of the AGADE hybrid algorithm on four different complexity maps is improved by 92.8%, 64.5%, 50.0%, and 71.2% respectively. The path length is slightly increased compared with the GA algorithm, but the path trajectory curve is located in the center of the tree row, with fewer turns, and it meets the articulated steering tractor operation needs in the orchard environment, proving that the improved hybrid algorithm is effective. © 2024 by the authors."

Methods and Children were prospectively recruited to the Born in Bradford birth cohort between March 2007 and December 2010. results Diagnoses of CHD were identified through linkage to the congenital anomaly register and independently verified by clinicians. Multivariable regression accounted for relevant confounders. Our primary outcome was the odds of ‘below expected’ attainment in maths, reading, and writing at ages 4–11 years. Educational records of 139 children with non-genetic CHD were compared with 11 188 age-matched children with no major congenital anomaly. Children with CHD had significantly higher odds of ‘below expected’ attainment in maths at age 4–5 years [odds ratio (OR) 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07–2.52], age 6–7 (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.32–3.12), and age 10–11 (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.01–5.14). Odds worsened with age, with similar results for reading and writing. The odds of receiving special educational needs support reduced with age for children with CHD relative to controls [age 4–5: OR 4.84 (2.06–11.40); age 6–7: OR 3.65 (2.41–5.53); age 10–11: OR 2.73 (1.84–4.06)]. Attainment was similar for children with and without exposure to cardio-pulmonary bypass. Lower attainment was strongly associated with the number of pre-school hospital admissions. Conclusion Children with CHD have lower educational attainment compared with their peers. Deficits are evident from school entry and increase throughout primary school. © The Author(s) 2023."

The understanding of the properties of light and photon energy is an important issue in physics/natural philosophy, and it is also a problem of pursuing cognitive certainty of nature. Comparing the deterministic differences between consciousness and experience, summarizing and analyzing the three causes of thinking, constructing the logical relationship between natural philosophy, philosophical epistemology, and certainty, a four element cognitive model of natural philosophy was established. The model answers the source of certainty of axiomatic knowledge, deepens the understanding of Newton's natural philosophy method of ""induction"", and also answers the validity of physics and mathematics, as well as their roles and functions in understanding nature. The model clearly reveals the logical relationship between time and space. Based on Newton's methodology of natural philosophy, the logical connection between natural laws and causal thinking and the limitations of falsificationism are expounded, and the traceability of theory (axiom) and three traceability conditions are proposed. A new inductive cognition of ""photons as electric magnetic particles"" was proposed, and the micro effects and influences of photon kinetic energy are discussed by inductive method.

It can be interpreted as allocating certain service providers (e.g., military formations, fire brigades or ambulances) to chosen locations within a certain area. Thereby the whole service (i.e., response to enemy attacks, fire or medical urgencies) should be established in a least expensive way, while still assuring a required “double Roman” level of availability and redundancy of providers. The standard version of DRD treated in the literature identifies the total expense of service with the total number of needed providers. In this paper a new “minimum-cost” version of DRD is considered, which is more general and more realistic than the standard version. It takes into account the fact that the actual expenses of providing service can differ from one location to another. Thus, formally speaking, each vertex in our graph is given a cost that is intepreted as the cost of keeping one service provider at the corresponding location. First, it is noted that the considered minimum-cost DRD problem is NP-hard, not only for general graphs but also for many special graph classes. Next, a dynamic programming algorithm is constructed, which shows that the problem can still be solved in linear time if the involved graph is a tree. Finally, as a solution for general graphs, a heuristic is proposed based on greedy construction and local search. Performance of both algorithms is evaluated by experiments. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023."

Thus, the aim of this paper is to describe and analyse how a group of 130 prospective primary school teachers vary a proportionality problem (comparison of ratios) given in a hypothetical classroom episode to address the difficulties encountered by students in solving it. We analyse whether these modifications are consistent with their didactic purposes and how they justify their decisions. We follow a mixed approach based on theoretical and methodological tools of the Ontosemiotic Approach and aspects of the creation of problems by variation. Among the results obtained, we highlight some shortcomings in the specialised knowledge of proportional reasoning, which prevent future teachers from creating variations of a problem to respond to this didactic-mathematical requirement.

Applying topological theory to photonics, known as, topological photonics, has become a significant principle and method in the field, attracting considerable attention for its novel light field manipulation capabilities. As an emerging research field, topological photonics originates from the concept of topological insulators in condensed matter physics. By introducing topology, integrated photonic systems acquire new properties, including unidirectional edge states and robustness against impurities or defects. These properties endow topological photonic devices with great potential for applications in optical communications, quantum computing, and high-precision sensing. Progress This paper reviews the research progress in integrated topological photonic devices for on-chip information processing. Initially, it delves into the basic theory of topological photonics, detailing the design principles of one- and two-dimensional topological photonic devices and their applications in on-chip optical information processing. These applications include waveguides, couplers, splitters, mode-order converters, electro-optical modulators, lasers, optical switches, logic gates, and filters. Each device exhibits unique features and advantages based on different topological phases or mechanisms, such as Zak phase (Fig. 1), Floquet phase (Fig. 1), topological pumping mechanism (Fig. 2), quantum Hall phase (Fig. 3), quantum spin Hall phase (Fig. 4), and quantum valley Hall phase (Fig. 5). In addition, we explore topological photonic devices in emerging fields, including non-Hermitian systems (Fig. 6), synthetic dimensions (Fig. 7), nonlinear optics (Fig. 8), and bound states in the continuum (Fig. 9). Examples such as non-Hermitian topological lasers and synthetic dimension microloop modulators illustrate the expansion of topological photonics applications and the realization of new functionalities in practical systems. Conclusions and Prospects Integrated topological photonic devices hold substantial potential for on-chip optical information processing, enabling both the speed and quality of information processing while improving system robustness and reliability. With continued advancements in topological photonics theory and related technologies, we can expect the development of more topological photonic devices with innovative functions, enabling complex optical path control and high-efficiency optical signal processing. Further research in topological photonics will likely bridge connections with other fields such as quantum information science and nanotechnology, driving revolutionary advancements in information technology. © 2024 Chinese Optical Society.

To promote equal opportunities for all students, it is essential to comprehend gender differences in math learning at school and identify potential barriers to educational equality. In this regard, our study examined the gender differences in solving word problems, and whether they relate to the solution strategy the students were taught. The study involved 100 10th-grade students divided into two groups and taught different solving approaches. One group was taught an algebraic approach using linear equations, while the other group was taught a combined approach, which incorporates the algebraic solution with a functional-graphic solution using a graph of a linear function. The research findings reveal gender differences in various aspects: Girls who learned the algebraic approach had better attainments than boys; Boys who learned the combined approach opted to solve problems with functions and graphs, whereas girls in the same group preferred an algebraic solution; Boys who learned the combined approach achieved significantly higher than boys who learned the algebraic approach. This study illuminates the importance of teaching word problems using diverse solution strategies because different populations of students respond differently to different strategies. © 2024 The Authors"

Yet, its impact on executive functions, particularly for disadvantaged children, still need to be explored. This study investigated the effects of short-term intensive design-based STEM learning on executive function among left-behind children. Sixty-one Grade 4 students from a school dedicated to the left-behind children in China were sampled and randomly assigned to an experimental group (10.70 ± 0.47 years old, n = 30) or a control group (10.77 ± 0.43 years old, n = 31). The experimental group underwent a two-week design-based STEM training program, while the control group participated in a 2-week STEM-related reading program. Both groups were assessed with the brain activation from 4 brain regions of interest using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and behavioral measures during a Stroop task before and after the training. Analysis disclosed: (i) a significant within-group time effect in the experimental group, with posttest brain activation in Brodmann Area 10 and 46 being notably lower during neutral and word conditions; (ii) a significant between-group difference at posttest, with the experimental group showing considerably lower brain activation in Brodmann Area 10 and Brodmann Area 46 than the control group; and (iii) a significant task effect in brain activity among the three conditions of the Stroop task. These findings indicated that this STEM learning effectively enhanced executive function in left-behind children. The discrepancy between the non-significant differences in behavioral performance and the significant ones in brain activation implies a compensatory mechanism in brain activation. This study enriches current theories about the impact of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) learning on children’s executive function development, providing biological evidence and valuable insights for educational curriculum design and assessment. © Crown copyright 2024."

In addition, this research seeks not only to alleviate prevailing uncertainties but also to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the economic landscape by identifying causal factors and providing a relevant contextual framework for the threats to society and regional development in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which affects sustainability both economically and socially. These disruptions have given rise to unprecedented uncertainties that could potentially trigger an irreversible cascade of shortages, leading to escalating costs of critical or irreplaceable products that directly affect regional development. This paper scrutinizes this intricate process, aiming to discern underlying patterns and mitigate the prevailing uncertainty—a state that challenges rational decision-making. In this pursuit, established economic theories are deployed to provide comprehensive insights into the evolving reality.

It has long been recognized that the proper description of eddy viscosity uses tensor mathematics, but in practice it is almost always employed as a scalar due to uncertainty about how to constrain the extra degrees of freedom and physical properties of its tensorial form. This manuscript borrows techniques from outside the realm of geophysical fluid dynamics to consider the eddy viscosity tensor using its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, establishing a new framework by which tensorial eddy viscosity can be tested. This is made possible by a careful analysis of an operation called tensor unrolling, which casts the eigenvalue problem for a fourth-order tensor into a more familiar matrix-vector form, whereby it becomes far easier to understand and manipulate. New constraints are established for the eddy viscosity coefficients that are guaranteed to result in energy dissipation, backscatter, or a combination of both. Finally, a testing protocol is developed by which tensorial eddy viscosity can be systematically evaluated across a wide range of fluid regimes. © 2024 The Author(s).

In this work, we present an algorithm that automatically constructs the optimal and exact tree tensor network operators (TTNO) for any sum-of-product symbolic quantum operator. The construction is based on the minimum vertex cover of a bipartite graph. With the optimal TTNO, we simulate open quantum systems, such as spin relaxation dynamics in the spin-boson model and charge transport in molecular junctions. In these simulations, the environment is treated as discrete modes and its wavefunction is evolved on equal footing with the system. We employ the Cole-Davidson spectral density to model the glassy phonon environment and incorporate temperature effects via thermo-field dynamics. Our results show that the computational cost scales linearly with the number of discretized modes, demonstrating the efficiency of our approach. © 2024 Author(s)."

To address this, a novel online energy management method based on the prioritized sum-tree experience replay strategy with a double delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (PSTER-TD3) is proposed in this paper. First, we formulate the sequential scheduling decision problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) problem with the objective of minimizing residential energy costs while simultaneously ensuring household thermal comfort and minimizing range anxiety for electric vehicle usage. Then, using the proposed method, we determine the optimal online scheduling strategy under this objective. By integrating the prioritized experience replay strategy of the summation tree structure into TD3, the agent is able to learn the optimal scheduling strategy in complex environments, and its optimization performance and policy learning efficiency are significantly improved. In addition, its ability to handle multidimensional continuous action spaces helps achieve finer-grained optimization for RMs. The case study results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively reduce the energy costs of residential microgrids while satisfying household thermal comfort requirements and reducing range anxiety for electric vehicle usage. Moreover, the optimization performance of the proposed method is robust when the uncertainty factors fluctuate violently in the environment. © 2023"

The mathematical model defined by a nonlinear system includes mainly two partial differential equations (PDEs): a parabolic equation for the pressure and a convection-diffusion equation for the saturation. The pressure is obtained by a conservative mixed finite volume element method (MFVE). The computational accuracy is improved for Darcy velocity. A conservative upwind mixed finite volume element method (UMFVE) is applied to compute the saturation on changing meshes. The diffusion is discretized by a mixed finite volume element method, and the convection is computed by upwind differences. The upwind method can solve convection-dominated diffusion equations accurately and avoids numerical dispersion and nonphysical oscillation. The saturation and the adjoint vector function are obtained simultaneously. An optimal order error estimates is obtained.

Firstly, a wide range of corrigent and the mass fractions were extensively screened using electronic tongue technology. Subsequently, a combination of sensory evaluation, analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-fuzzy mathematics evaluation, and Box-Behnken experimental design were employed to comprehensively assess the taste-masking effects of different combinations of corrigent on ibuprofen oral solution, optimize the taste-masking formulation, and validate the results. The study received ethical approval from the Review Committee of the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (ethical code: 2024BZYLL0102). The results showed that corrigent fractions and types were screened separately through single-factor experiments. Subsequently, a Box-Behnken response surface design combined with AHP and fuzzy mathematics evaluation was used to fit a functional model: Z = 688.310 11 − 3 023.722 22X1 − 11.477 00X2 + 62.721 67X3 + 14.600 00X1X2 − 179.666 67X1X3 − 3.152 00X2X3 + 4 031.111 11X1 2 + 0.525 28X2 2 + 9.772 00X3 2. This model is stable and reliable, determining the optimal taste-masking formulation to be 3.9 g·L-1 of stevioside, 100 g L-1 of xylitol, and 30 g L-1 of methyl-β-cyclodextrin. The comprehensive score of the verification test is 88.14, with a relative RSD of 0.39%, indicating the feasibility of this model. This study achieved the improvement of the taste of ibuprofen oral solution through a combination of objective and subjective methods. Three types of corrigent were identified for enhancing drug taste, leading to the selection of the optimal taste-masking formulation for ibuprofen oral solution. This significantly enhanced the taste of the original formulation, improved patient compliance, and offered a new approach to mitigating the undesirable taste of formulations. © 2024, Chinese Pharmaceutical Association.

In this game, the first player is a (semi-) public firm adopting bounded rationality and aims to maximize the weighted sum of its own profit and social welfare, while the second player focus on the objective to maximize its own profit as a private firm with naïve expectation. The local stability conditions for the quantum Nash equilibrium of the system are analyzed. Numerical simulations are presented to display the dynamic behaviors including stability region, bifurcation and chaos diagrams, and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. The results of theoretical and numerical analysis show that a larger weight on profit or adjustment speed parameter can enhance the stability of the quantum Cournot duopoly system. Differently, a higher entanglement level will hasten the local instability of the quantum Nash equilibrium point. It is also shown that a larger quantum entanglement weakens the sensitivity to initial conditions. Moreover, the equilibrium of the system can loose stability via flip bifurcation while varying the value of the adjustment speed, and time-delayed feedback control method can be applied to stabilize the chaotic behaviors. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

We draw inspiration from sports tournament designs and propose to adopt modified knockout (KO) tournaments. Two variants of modified KO tournaments are described, which adapt the tree selection sorting algorithm and the replacement selection algorithm known from computer science. To validate the proposed method, a listening experiment is conducted, where binaural renderings of seven chamber music halls are compared regarding loudness and reverberance. The rankings obtained by the modified KO tournament method are compared to those obtained from a traditional round-robin (RR) design, where all possible pairs are compared. Moreover, the paper presents simulations to illustrate the method's robustness when choosing different parameters and assuming different underlying data distributions. The study's findings demonstrate that modified KO tournaments are more efficient than full RR designs in terms of the number of comparisons required for identifying the top ranking samples. Thus, they provide a promising alternative for this task. We offer an open-source implementation so that researchers can easily integrate KO designs into their studies. © 2024 Author(s)."

The building's geometry assumes Z and + shapes based on specific limb configurations. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed to quantify wind-induced pressures, resulting in wind force coefficients. These coefficients are used to develop predictive machine learning models through Gene Expression Programming, Group Method of Data Handling-combinatorial (GMDH-Combi), Model Tree, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques. The ANN analysis explores various combinations of training algorithms, adaptation functions, activation functions, and performance functions to enhance model accuracy. Among these, the Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) with gradient descent with momentum (GDM) adaptation function and sigmoid activation function exhibit superior performance with high R-squared values. These predictive models are then employed for a comprehensive comparative assessment of the maximum wind force coefficient (CF, max) concerning different limb positions and angles of attack (AOA). For CF, max vs Limb position, variations of limb position are examined for most critical cases of AOA. Similarly, the study of CF, max vs AOA involves an exhaustive investigation into the variation of AOA for the building with the worst limb position. The analysis reveals that changes in AOA have a more pronounced effect on CF, max compared to alterations in limb position. Interestingly, within the AOA range of 1.5 to 2.5, the CF, max consistently reaches a minimum across all models. However, the relationship between CF, max and the critical structural parameter ‘S' (representing limb position) remains less conclusive for the most significant AOAs. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Such slow brain rhythms typically have a lower frequency than tonic action-potential firing. They are assumed to arise from network-level mechanisms, involving synaptic interactions and delays, or from intrinsically bursting neurons. Neuronal burst generation is commonly attributed to ion channels with slow kinetics. Here, we explore an alternative mechanism generically available to all neurons with class I excitability. It is based on the interplay of fast-spiking voltage dynamics with a one-dimensional slow dynamics of the extracellular potassium concentration, mediated by the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase. We use bifurcation analysis of the complete system as well as the slow-fast method to reveal that this coupling suffices to generate a hysteresis loop organized around a bistable region that emerges from a saddle-node loop bifurcation–a common feature of class I excitable neurons. Depending on the strength of the Na+/K+-ATPase, bursts are generated from pump-induced shearing the bifurcation structure, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolarization block. We suggest that transitions between these dynamics can result from disturbances in extracellular potassium regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting the Na+/K+-ATPase activity. The identified minimal mechanistic model outlining the sodium-potassium pump’s generic contribution to burst dynamics can, therefore, contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of pathologies such as epilepsy syndromes and, potentially, inform therapeutic strategies. © 2024 Behbood et al.

A sample of 350 teachers from the Eastern Province completed a 40-item survey on their STEAM perceptions and teaching requirements. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses revealed overall positive perspectives, with 78.6% strongly agreeing that STEAM transforms classrooms into creative environments. However, just 58.4% felt it enabled active learning, and 67.4% were unsure about systemic support. Significant differences emerged based on teacher gender and qualifications, but not experience levels or stages. While largely optimistic attitudes exist toward STEAM's value, persistent resourcing, competency, and policy barriers likely impede classroom adoption. Recommendations encompass boosting investments in STEAM infrastructure, aligned teacher professional development, specialized materials and tools, and integration support across subjects. Further research incorporating mixed methods, expanded samples, and longitudinal tracking can delineate evidence-based strategies to catalyze effective STEAM adoption.

By utilizing graph theory, we demonstrate how this concept naturally arises when Euler's theorem is fulfilled in molecular graphs of tree, cycle, and polyhedral types. This significantly advances our understanding of topology, leading to a new interpretation for deriving such a set. A key aspect of the local vibrational mode theory is the decomposition of normal modes into local mode contributions, which provides a powerful approach for analyzing vibrational spectra. This however requires a complete and meaningful set of non-redundant local vibrational modes, as demonstrated for the IR spectra of both non-zwitterionic and zwitterionic forms of glycine, the cubane and perfluorocubane pair, and the Ar–benzene dimer.

A genetic algorithm is employed to select a set of points of consumption (plots of land)–which indirectly determine the network routing over the road network–resulting in a project with a better net present value. To obtain the routing, the Steiner tree problem is solved through an approximation that involves several algorithms derived from graph theory and the use of georeferenced information. The design is constrained to ensure technical feasibility, so that the available thermal power from the plant, averaged for hourly periods over a year, is greater than the demand from the greenhouses. The said demand is calculated through an empty-greenhouse climate model, considering temperature setpoints compatible with the most common crops in the region. According to the results, a network of total length equal to 1.3464 km and an average pipe diameter of 0.1532 m would be required to annually supply 8621.4 MWh of heat to 12 points of consumption. The net present value of the project would be 6 417 900 €, considering a 3% discount rate and useful life of 30 years, with an initial investment cost of 1 723 300 € and an annual operation cost of 15 800 €year−1. A sensibility analysis of the variables with greater economic impact is also presented. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Recently, a new type of primitive was introduced to the Vulkan® and DirectX® ray-tracing APIs that promises to alleviate this issue: Opacity Micromaps, a structure that uses a bit of extra memory as hints to the pipeline when it should actually call the AnyHit-shader. In this paper, we extend this primitive with a novel compression method that uses the concept of succinct 4-way trees to reduce the memory footprint by up to 110 times, including an algorithm for looking up micromap values directly from this compressed form. Further, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the generated micromaps to demonstrate their performance in terms of both memory footprint and frame render time compared to a number of similar structures. Finally, we highlight some aspects of the extension that developers and artists should be aware of to make the most out of it. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

Most research focuses on the single mechanical frequency locking phenomenon, but few studies focus on multi-mechanical frequency locking phenomenon. In this study, the multi-mechanical frequency locking mechanism and robustness analysis of the peak frequency is proposed through multi-mode coupled vibration. Firstly, a multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) coupled resonator consisting of a low-frequency resonant element and multiple high-frequency resonant elements is designed, and the vibration energy of the resonant system can be transferred from the low-frequency resonant element driven by a harmonic excitation to the high-frequency resonant elements via the 1:3 internal resonance. Through perturbation and bifurcation analysis, the nonlinear dynamic behaviors of MDOF coupled resonator are analyzed in detail. It is found that the peak frequency of the low-frequency resonant element can remain stable in multiple drive intervals, leading to multi-mechanical frequency locking phenomenon. Then, a 3-DOF magnetic coupled resonant system is experimentally designed to demonstrate the physical conditions and influencing factors of the double mechanical frequency locking phenomenon. Typically, introducing external disturbances, the frequency locking is experimentally demonstrated to improve the robustness of peak frequency. The experimental results show that when the mechanical frequency locking phenomenon occurs, the influence of small external noise disturbance on the peak frequency can be ignored, which greatly improves the frequency stability of nonlinear resonant systems. © 2024"

The results showed that the participants did not present difficulties when proposing PAEV with respect to the combination and comparison structures, the opposite happening with respect to the change and equalization structures. On the other hand, with the analysis of semantic dependency, it was observed that a statement presents coherence, with the argument, the agent and the verb being present, so it is not necessary for the seven terms to appear.

Also, there is a tendency of deflection increment without a bifurcation point to occur for imperfect structures. In this paper, some relatively unknown phenomena are investigated. First, it is demonstrated that in some conditions, the linear buckling mode shape may differ from the result of geometrically nonlinear analysis. Second, a mode jumping phenomenon is described as a transition from a secondary equilibrium path to an obscure one as a tertiary equilibrium path or a second bifurcation point. In this regard, some non-square plates with unsymmetric layer arrangements (in the presence of extension–bending coupling) are subjected to a uniaxial in-plane compression. By considering the geometrically linear and nonlinear problems, the bucking modes and post-buckling behaviors, e.g., the out-of-plane displacement of the plate versus the load, are obtained by ANSYS 2023 R1 software.

In this paper, we expand the benefits of this data-structure in two respects. First, we show how to bring bisection based tessellations to arbitrary polygon meshes rather than just squares. Our approach consists of mapping a triangular subdivision primitive, which we refer to as a bisector, to each halfedge of the input mesh. These bisectors can then be subdivided adaptively to produce conforming triangulations solely based on halfedge operators. Second, we alleviate a limitation that restricted the triangulations to low subdivision levels. We do so by using the CBT as a memory pool manager rather than an implicit encoding of the triangulation as done originally. By using a CBT in this way, we concurrently allocate and/or release bisectors during adaptive subdivision using shared GPU memory. We demonstrate the benefits of our improvements by rendering planetary scale geometry out of very coarse meshes. Performance-wise, our triangulation method evaluates in less than 0.2ms on console-level hardware. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

The extremal number of A, denoted ex(n, A), is the maximum number of 1-entries that an n × n zero-one matrix can have without containing A. The systematic study of this function for various patterns A goes back to the work of Füredi and Hajnal from 1992, and the field has many connections to other areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science. The problem has been particularly extensively studied for so-called acyclic matrices, but very little is known about the general case (i.e., the case where A is not necessarily acyclic). We prove the first asymptotically tight general result by showing that if A has at most t 1-entries in every row, then ex(n, A) ≤ n2−1/t+o(1). This verifies a conjecture of Methuku and Tomon.

Ammonia and hydrogen are essential carbon-neutral fuels suited for deployment in heavy-duty, long-haul transportation applications. The technological complementarity of ammonia and hydrogen can be realized in the current context by combining various energy conversion devices. Energy management strategy (EMS) is one of the critical technologies in hybrid systems. In this study, a novel EMS based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed for a heavy-duty automotive hybrid system containing an ammonia-hydrogen internal combustion engine (ICE), a fuel cell system (FCS), an ammonia electrolysis cell (AEC), and Li-ion batteries (LB). To address the protracted training times and convergence challenges intrinsic to DRL, a fuzzy logic control (FLC) is introduced to provide expert demonstrations during the DRL agent's learning process. The incorporation of FLC not only facilitates the convergence speed of the DRL algorithm, but also strikes a good balance between the operation efficiency improvement and battery SOC maintenance. The simulation results show that the proposed EMS improves average efficiency by 2 % with a modest 0.75 % SOC reduction across four operational scenarios compared to the FLC-based EMS. After thorough validation of the proposed EMS, a parametric study is conducted to examine three key parameters: charge mode threshold, FCS power change rate limit, and hybrid mode threshold. The study aims to offer valuable insights for formulating the EMS of the ammonia-hydrogen hybrid system. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

We study three cohorts of students in European and traditional English-speaking immigration countries using combinations of international assessment studies (PIRLS, TIMSS and PISA). To address the issue of comparability of test scores across surveys and over time, we exploit rank-based measures of relative performance, which only require ordinal comparability of the data. We do not find significant differences between the academic achievements of immigrant children and their native-born peers in English-speaking receiving countries. By contrast, immigrant-background children – both of first- and of second-generation – exhibit a large achievement gap in primary school in Europe, even when accounting for observable differences in socioeconomic characteristics. The gap tends to narrow down in secondary education in both reading and mathematics but is not fully absorbed in most countries. This finding is noteworthy among second-generation students in systems with early tracking. The performance of students with mixed parents is not markedly different from native students. Diverging educational progress between immigrant children in traditional immigration countries and our sample of European countries seems to reinforce the importance of the initial socioeconomic endowment in shaping the academic trajectories of immigrant children. © 2024 The Authors"

In the model of atomic irradiation of solids with unbounded cross-sectional areas, determining the average number of atoms displaced has been achieved through delay systems that incorporate the consideration of past states. In this study, we employ the discrete collocation method using local radial basis functions to numerically solve Abel-type integral equations with a delay argument. This method balances accuracy, efficiency, and flexibility and is well-suited for complex practical problems as it requires less memory and computational volume compared to its global counterpart. Instead of approximating the solution at all points of the domain, the method considers a set of nodes in the neighborhood of a certain point. As a result, the method can be readily implemented on a standard personal computer without requiring high-end specifications. To calculate the singular integrals the nonuniform composite Gauss–Legendre numerical integration rule is employed. We discuss the error analysis and convergence rate of the offered scheme and test it with several numerical examples. The results obtained are also consistent with the theoretical error analysis expectations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

There are well-known regions of the branch length parameter space where accurate estimation of phylogenetic trees is especially difficult. Several novel studies have recently demonstrated that machine learning approaches have the potential to help solve phylogenetic problems with greater accuracy and computational efficiency. In this study, as a proof of concept, we sought to explore the possibility of machine learning models to predict branch lengths. To that end, we designed several deep learning frameworks to estimate branch lengths on fixed tree topologies from multiple sequence alignments or its representations. Our results show that deep learning methods can exhibit superior performance in some difficult regions of branch length parameter space. For example, in contrast to maximum likelihood inference, which is typically used for estimating branch lengths, deep learning methods are more efficient and accurate. In general, we find that our neural networks achieve similar accuracy to a Bayesian approach and are the best-performing methods when inferring long branches that are associated with distantly related taxa. Together, our findings represent a next step toward accurate, fast, and reliable phylogenetic inference with machine learning approaches. Copyright: © 2024 Suvorov, Schrider.

Typical rate distortion optimization algorithms based on Human Visual System only consider the color information, which limit the coding performance. In this paper, a Coding Tree Unit (CTU) level quantization parameter (QP) adjustment algorithm based on JND and spatial complexity is proposed to improve the subjective and objective quality of Video-Based Point Cloud Compression (V-PCC). Firstly, it is found that the JND model is degraded at CTU level for attribute video due to the pixel filling strategy of V-PCC, and an improved JND model is designed using the occupancy map. Secondly, a spatial complexity detection metric is designed to measure the visual importance of each CTU. Finally, a CTU-level QP adjustment scheme based on both JND levels and visual importance is proposed for geometry and attribute video. The experimental results show that, compared with the latest V-PCC (TMC2-18.0) anchors, the BD-rate is reduced by -2:8% and -3:2% for D1 and D2 metrics, respectively, and the subjective quality is improved significantly.  © 2024 The Institute of Electronics."

The results generated by clustering algorithms generally depend on user-defined input parameters such as the number of expected clusters, which can have a great impact on the homogeneity of the identified clusters. Clustering validity indices (CVIs) are an effective method for determining the optimal number of clusters that best fit the natural partition of a dataset. They do not require any underlying assumption nor a priori knowledge about the true dataset structure. Since 1965, many cluster validity indices have been proposed in the literature and used in several different applications. In this paper, the performance of 68 cluster validity indices was evaluated on 21 real-life research and simulated datasets. CVIs were compared on the same partition for each dataset, which was searched for by the k-means clustering algorithm. Multivariate chemometric methods were applied to disclose mutual relationships among the indices and to select those that are more effective in terms of accuracy and reliability. © 2024 The Authors"

Further, we investigated the potential influence of socioeconomic status (SES). METHODS: A population-wide, register-based, cross-sectional study was performed. We compared the results of children with and without JIA in the Danish National Well-Being Questionnaire (DNWQ), the National Danish School Testing (NDST), and their ninth grade (aged approximately 16 yrs) final school marks in Danish and mathematics. The results were analyzed using adjusted ordinal logistic regression (SWB) and linear regression (tests and marks). RESULTS: In separate cohorts, we included a total of 505,340 children answering the DNWQ, 812,461 children with NDST results, and the ninth-grade final marks of 581,804 children. Of these children, 1042, 1541, and 1410, respectively, fulfilled the criteria of JIA. Children with JIA reported SWB comparable to their peers, except for the question ""Do you perform well in school?"" (odds ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.99). In the NDST, the children with JIA in general did just as well as their peers. We found no differences in the ninth-grade final marks in either Danish or mathematics. Stratifying the analyses on SES showed no significant differences in the associations. CONCLUSION: Overall, children with JIA report SWB comparable to that of children without JIA and perform equally well in school as children without JIA.

And what factors promote vulnerability and what actions or interventions have been implemented to mitigate it? Twenty-two articles published between 2019 and 2023 were selected. Based on the literature review, an inclusion/exclusion model is proposed that contributes to the clarity of the concept of vulnerability. Four population groups were identified that have been studied in the field of Mathematics Education. Studies are distinguished in the perspective if exclusion or inclusion. In the former group, key concepts are numeracy and language, while in the latter, the key concept is inclusive education. The results suggest the need to expand the research and educational actions to promote the inclusion of vulnerable populations that have been under-studied in Mathematics Education. © 2024 Mexican Society for Research and Dissemination of Mathematics Education.

The initial and final poses, turning radius, and trajectory length, and first-order smoothness constraint of UAV are considered in the trajectory planning. The RRT algorithm and a pruning optimization method based on a greedy algorithm are utilized to plan the feasible discrete waypoints that satisfy the obstacle avoidance requirements in a two-dimensional task space. Multiple Dubins curves are employed to smoothly connect the waypoints. A multi-constraint trajectory optimization mathematical model is established based on the UAV's initial and final poses, and the constraints related to the UAV's performance and obstacles. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to determine the curve types and optimize the poses at the curve connections and the curve radii, thereby obtaining the shortest trajectory.

Recent research has employed encoder-tree decoder frameworks to simulate the reasoning process of arithmetic expressions for generating answers. However, this approach overlooks the inherent diversity of expressions; there might be multiple valid reasoning paths, leading to a decrease in the accuracy of inferred expression trees. Moreover, encoders, lacking rich domain knowledge, struggle to capture deep relationships between questions and supporting evidence; this limitation results in models making errors when selecting operation units. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-Fusion encoder and EX-N tree decoder table-text data question-answering model(KFEX-N). During the encoding process, the integration of traditional encoders with cross-fusion encoders forms a knowledge-fusion encoder, endowing the model with rich domain knowledge and enhancing its understanding of the operational units required to answer questions. Additionally, we propose an EX-N tree decoder. It reduces the diversity of inference paths through a constrained structure and mitigates the occurrence of final answer errors resulting from decoding errors.

There is no simple formula for its computation, thus numerical algorithms are essential for coping with the practical problems involved. The commercial implementations for the numerical solutions, such as the functions ellipticK and EllipticK provided by MATLAB and Mathematica respectively, are based on Kcs(m) instead of the usual form K(k) such that Kcs(k2)=K(k) and m=k2. It is necessary to develop open source implementations for the computation of the CEI-1 in order to avoid potential risks of using commercial software and possible limitations due to the unknown factors. In this paper, the infinite series method, arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) method, Gauss–Chebyshev method and Gauss–Legendre methods are discussed in details with a top-down strategy. The four key algorithms for computing the CEI-1 are designed, verified, validated and tested, which can be utilized in R& D and be reused properly.

Existing methods typically rely solely on subjective or objective data. The subjectivity of expert opinions and insufficient objective data affect the reliability of results. To reduce subjectivity in the risk analysis process and enhance the utilization of subjective and objective data, this study proposes an extended Bayesian network (BN) model for calculating the dam failure probability based on fuzzy sets (FSs) and dynamic evidential reasoning. To address the fuzziness and uncertainty of expert opinions, a Gaussian FS was introduced to transform expert opinions into fuzzy numbers. Additionally, a dynamic evidential reasoning approach was proposed to combine subjective and objective data, considering their differences, subjectivity, and potential conflicts. To maintain consistency in the fuzzification and defuzzification processes, an improved Onisawa formula was proposed. Finally, the BN was employed for probability prediction and sensitivity analyses. The model was applied to the Z hydropower dam in China. The results showed that the failure probability was 5.2 × 10−4, and the main controllable risk factors were identified. A comparative analysis was conducted and the results showed that the proposed method had a better ability to handle uncertainty, reduce subjectivity, and mitigate conflicts. © 2024"

The optimal route prediction, however, is a fundamental prerequisite for UAV in commercial applications. This paper introduces an Improved Rapid random tree (IRRT∗) algorithm with triangular inequality rewiring technique for finding collision free path for UAVs in a three-dimensional (3D) environment. The 3D building environments for navigation were developed using MATLAB/Simulink 2021, a virtual occupancy grid model. By considering UAV variable elements such as roll angle, air speed, flight path angle, and boundary threshold parameters, the suggested work aims to provide a comparative analysis of sampling algorithm-based optimal path. The proposed route planning control strategy is to identify the violation free path to locate the destination in 3D environment at variable altitude and air speed. Compared to the standard RRT and RRT∗algorithms, the proposed IRRT∗algorithm can shorten the planning time, reduce the cost distance and improve the algorithm's applicability in the formation path planning problem.

This heightened wear further contributes to the generation of substantial heat, consequently causing an elevation in temperature. As a consequence, the thermal deformation of the gear occurs, thereby affecting its capacity to effectively transmit power. This study presents the development of a nonlinear dynamic model for a gear system, incorporating the influence of wear and temperature. The model is constructed by integrating the Archard wear model with the thermal deformation idea. The present work investigates the influence of wear and temperature on the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of a gear system using a range of analytical techniques, such as bifurcation diagrams, maximum Lyapunov index charts, phase diagrams, and Poincare cross-section diagrams. The results indicate that as the temperature increases, the system transitions from multi-cycle motion to single cycle motion. When there is slight wear (28 microns), increasing the temperature appropriately can suppress the chaotic motion of the system. When there is severe wear (70 microns), the gears must be replaced. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering 2024."

In this paper, we investigate the problems of maximizing monotone non-submodular set functions under three classes of independent system constraints, including p-matroid intersection constraints, p-extendible system constraints and p-system constraints. We prove that the greedy algorithm yields an approximation ratio of γp+γ for the former two problems, and ξγp+ξγ for the last problem, which further has been improved to γp+γ, where γ,ξ denote the submodularity ratio and the diminishing returns ratio of set function respectively. In addition, we also show that the greedy guarantees have a further refinement of ξp+αξ for all the problems mentioned above, where α is the generalized curvature of set function.

Focusing on the navigation (individual adaptation) and negotiation (social adaptation) factors that contribute to school success, our data from a longitudinal study in Switzerland (wave 1 in autumn 2020, grade eight [n = 315]; wave 2 in spring 2021, grade eight [n = 257]) revealed four patterns: students with high levels in both dimensions (“thriving”), students with low levels in both dimensions (“demanding”), students with low negotiation but moderate to high navigation (“unsupported bloomers”), and students with high negotiation but low navigation (“encouraged non-achievers”). The “thriving” pattern had about three times more students than the “encouraged non-achiever” pattern did and about five times more students with a lower depression/anxiety profile than the “demanding” pattern did. Parental involvement and reading comprehension were identified as crucial factors in students’ academic achievement, with parental involvement being significantly associated with the “unsupported bloomers” pattern, suggesting that parents can compensate for the lack of teacher academic support and recognition and it can contribute to students’ academic success. Adolescents with high navigation and negotiation resources had higher reading comprehension scores compared to those with lower navigation and negotiation resources.

By integrating key educational theories—Duval's Semiotic Representation Theory, Niss's Mathematical Competencies, Marton's Variation Theory, and the broad Engagement, Motivation, and Participation framework— the model offers a comprehensive and holistic understanding of students' cognitive landscapes. This research underscores the necessity of a multidimensional approach to capturing the intricate interplay of cognitive, affective, and behavioral factors in students' mathematical learning experiences. The novelty lies in its methodological innovation, employing FCMs to transcend traditional qualitative analyzes and facilitate quantitative insights into students' cognitive processes. This approach is particularly relevant in the current era dominated by digital learning environments and artificial intelligence, where real-time, automated analysis of student interactions is increasingly vital. The proposed FCM has been developed over the years with a data-driven approach; the concepts and relationships in it have been derived from the literature and refined by the author's experience in the field. Illustrated through case studies, the framework's utility is demonstrated in diverse contexts, highlighting how the quantitative data obtained are confirmed by qualitative approach: analyzing the impact of remote learning during the Covid-19 pandemic on student engagement and exploring Augmented Reality's role in enhancing mathematical conceptualization. These applications show the framework's adaptability and its potential to integrate new technologies in educational practices. However, the transition from qualitative to quantitative methodologies poses a challenge, given the prevalent use of qualitative approaches in mathematics education research. Additionally, the technological implementation of the FCM model in educational software presents practical hurdles, necessitating further development to ensure ease of integration and use in real-time educational settings. Future work will focus on bridging these methodological gaps and overcoming technological challenges to broaden the FCM model's applicability and enhance its contribution to advancing mathematics education. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Herein, we reported an efficient CO2-to-ethanol conversion (53.5 % faradaic efficiency at −0.75 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE)) over an oxide-derived nanocubic catalyst featured with abundant “embossment-like” structured grain-boundaries. The catalyst also attains a 23.2 % energy efficiency to ethanol within a flow cell reactor. In situ spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis identified that these dualphase Cu(I) and Cu(0) sites stabilized by grain-boundaries are very robust over the operating potential window, which maintains a high concentration of co-adsorbed *CO and hydroxyl (*OH) species. Theoretical calculations revealed that the presence of *OHad not only promote the easier dimerization of *CO to form *OCCO (ΔG~0.20 eV) at low overpotentials but also preferentially favor the key *CHCOH intermediate hydrogenation to *CHCHOH (ethanol pathway) while suppressing its dehydration to *CCH (ethylene pathway), which is believed to determine the remarkable ethanol selectivity. Such imperative intermediates associated with the bifurcation pathway were directly distinguished by isotope labelling in situ infrared spectroscopy. Our work promotes the understanding of bifurcating mechanism of CO2ER-to-hydrocarbons more deeply, providing a feasible strategy for the design of efficient ethanol-targeted catalysts. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

Selecting the optimal sizes and locations for these generators is crucial for minimizing network power loss and enhancing voltage profiles. The previously published methods have been plagued by issues such as slow convergence rates, entrapment in local optima, complexity, and extensive computational requirements. Addressing these limitations, this paper introduces an efficient methodology: the Memory-based Artificial Gorilla Troops Optimizer (MGTO). This approach leverages memory-based mechanisms to enhance exploration and decision-making, facilitating the seamless integration of various biomass DGs (BDGs) into unbalanced IEEE 37-bus radial networks. The immigration of gorillas during the exploration phase is enriched through the utilization of stored memories of candidate trajectories within the search space, enabling the silverback to make informed decisions. Furthermore, a multi-objective variant of MGTO is developed in collaboration with Fuzzy Decision-Making (FDM), allowing for the simultaneous optimization of multiple targets. To demonstrate the MGTO effectiveness, it is rigorously compared against a comprehensive set of established optimization algorithms, including the Honey Badger Algorithm (HBA), Runge Kutta Optimizer (RUN), and others. The results proved the dominance of the proposed MGTO by getting minimum power loss and voltage fluctuation of 0.364 % and 15.4 %, respectively, while in the multi-objective problem, the best results are 0.513 % loss and 17.9% voltage fluctuation. The results proved the consistency of the proposed MGTO in installing different BDGs into an unbalanced distribution network. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Although the development of PSFR is accelerating in China, it is still remains challenging to meet the demands of the energy transition due to various barriers that hinder it. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, as a typical region, plays a crucial role in the development of PSFR. Thus, this paper constructs an objective research framework to effectively analysis barriers and promotes the development of PSFR in the region. Firstly, based on the analysis of the current situation of PSF, 15 barriers affecting its development are identified. Then, the barrier identification framework is constructed to study the prominence of the above barriers and their transmission pathways.

The precise estimation of the flow coefficient is imperative in mitigating flood-related damages, administering flood alert mechanisms, and regulating water discharge. It is hard to accurately determine the flow coefficient without a good understanding of the river basin's hydrology, climate, topography, and soil characteristics. A range of methodologies have been documented in the most recent body of literature for flow coefficient modeling. The majority of these methods, however, depend on opaque techniques that lack generalizability. Therefore, this research employed three distinct methodologies—specifically, the Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), the Simple Membership Function, and the Fuzzy Rules Generation Technique (SMRGT) are all examples of fuzzy inference systems, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to achieve its objectives. The Aksu River Basin in Antalya, Turkey, was chosen as the study area. The models underwent multiple permutations of precipitation (P), temperature (T), relative humidity (Rh), wind speed (Ws), land use (LU), and soil properties (Sp) data that were tailored to the particular study region. The study analyzed the results using various performance metrics of the model such as mean absolute error (MAE), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R2). The results indicate that the SMRGT method resulted in a remarkable degree of accuracy in forecasting the flow coefficient, as demonstrated with the minimal RMSE and MAE values and high correlation coefficient values. The study's findings suggest that the SMRGT method was applied effectively in hydrological analysis to estimate the flow coefficient, contributing to more accurate flood prediction, water resource management, and flood mitigation strategies. © 2024"

We performed feature selection on the original features using Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC), resulting in a subset of 38 dimensions. Subsequently, we employed Sparse Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for dimensionality reduction, yielding a final subset of 12 dimensions.

We developed mathematics tasks from 30 real-world contexts, each with three questions of varying complexity, administered through a systematically rotated experimental design to 535 German grades 9 and 10 students. Various student variables were collected. Generalized linear mixed models revealed that contextual and mathematical task features significantly contributed to task difficulty variance. Language features had no intermediate-level influence, while students' mathematical self-efficacy moderated low task context familiarity's impact. These findings guide the construction of reality-based mathematics tasks to tailor empirical difficulty. Educational relevance: In the context of worldwide competence-orientated education, it is crucial to reform in-class and national tests. Traditional task formats are limited in representing authentic problems. In most school subjects, a lack of understanding exists in designing reality-based competence-oriented tasks that ensure fair test conditions and meet the subjects' normative demands. This study addresses this gap by empirically investigating the interplay of subject-related, linguistic, and contextual aspects of reality-based tasks in mathematics.

In NFV-enabled multicast services, the data flow should be passed through a series of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) before reaching destinations. In the problem of NFV-enabled multicast service embedding, not only the VNFs must be deployed, but also the traffic forwarding topology must be constructed. As the exact solution of this problem suffers from high computational complexity, the heuristic or approximation approaches are used in practice. However, as a way to control the trade off between complexity and efficiency, using multistage solutions is offered in literature. In this article, some two-stage approaches for embedding NFV-enabled multicast services are introduced, and they are compared through analysis and simulation. Specifically, a new low-complexity approach based on the Auxiliary VNF Graph (AVG) is proposed to determine the sub-optimal locations for VNF placement and to construct the NFV-based multicast routing tree.

Motivated by the medical ventilation technique of high-frequency ventilation (HFV), we investigate the potential for mean streaming to be maintained in this geometry as the frequency of reciprocation is increased while concurrently reducing the amplitude (and thereby reducing the volume per cycle). We identify four distinct regimes of flow. The first and second occur at low to moderate frequencies and generate significant streaming flows due to the interaction between Dean vortices that are generated during both the in- and out-flows. The third and fourth occur at high frequencies and produce reduced streaming, due to the reduction in formation length of the Dean vortices. Notably, the fourth regime at the highest frequencies investigated appears to show a switch in the direction of the streaming flow at the wall. Considering the motivating application of HFV, we show that currently employed frequencies are low, and much higher frequencies (and subsequently lower volumes per cycle) could potentially be employed. © 2024 The Author(s).

In contrast to this we start here off from the searched-for field, calculate its Fourier transform for fixed direction, which is now a vector or tensor field, that we then expand in a suitable direction dependent basis. The expansion coefficients are recognized as the Fourier transform of longitudinal, transversal or mixed ray transforms or vectorial Radon transform respectively. The inverse Fourier transform of the searched-for field then directly leads to inversion formulae for those transforms applying problem adapted backprojections. When considering the Helmholtz decomposition of the field we immediately find inversion formulae for those transversal or longitudinal transforms. First inversion formulae for the longitudinal ray transform, similar to those given by Natterer (1986 The Mathematics of Computerized Tomography (Teubner and Wiley)) for x-ray tomography, were given by Natterer-Wubbeling in 2001, Natterer and Wubbeling (2001 Mathematical Methods in Image Reconstruction (SIAM)), but then not pursued by other authors.

Additionally we present new inversion formulae for the vectorial Radon transform. As a consequence the inversion formulae directly give Plancherel’s formulae for the vectorial or tensorial transforms. Together with the Natterer inequality, which is independent of the ray or Radon transforms, we present the Natterer stability of those vectorial and tensorial transforms. © 2024 The Author(s).

A laboratory experiment is conducted using a scale model representing pollution spreading in a simplified flooded street network. The first focus of the study is on investigating the hydrodynamic processes that drive the transport of a pollutant in the streets and intersections (four-branch crossroads and three-branch bifurcations). The second focus is on assessing the sensitivity of the pollutant distribution to the location of the pollutant release. Last, we propose a simplified two-dimensional (2D) model of the pollutant transport in such a flooded street network. It is found that the pollutant mixing mainly takes place along the streets downstream of the intersections. The turbulent diffusion and dispersion by the secondary currents both contribute to the homogenization of the pollutant concentration across the streets. In the intersections, the pollutant transport is predominantly caused by the advection in the streamwise and transverse directions. The pollutant plumes simply merge or split, following the dividing streamlines of the mean flow. As a result, the pollutant distribution in the street network is highly sensitive to the pollutant release location with respect to the position of the dividing streamlines within bifurcations and crossroads. The data-sets of cross-sectional distributions of pollutant concentration could serve as benchmark data to criticize the various ways of modeling the diffusivity tensor in the numerical models that solve the 2D advection–diffusion equations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

In this paper, we introduce some generalizations by applying the variational method to deformable strings. We explore two specific cases: (i) in the first case, we investigate the nonlinear behavior of an elastic string with variable length, dependent on the applied boundary conditions; specifically, this analysis serves to introduce the variational method and demonstrate the process of finding analytical solutions; (ii) in the second case, we examine a deformable string with a constant length; however, we introduce mass redistribution within the string through nonlinear elastic interactions. In the first scenario, the deformation state of the string always describes elongation, as compression states prove to be unstable for fully flexible strings. In contrast, in the second scenario, the finite length constraint induces compressive states in specific configurations and regions of the string. However, it is worth noting that the solution to this problem exists only for values of the elastic constant that are not too low, a phenomenon that is studied in detail. We conduct here both analytical and graphical analyses of various geometries, comparing the elastic behavior of the two aforementioned types of strings. Understanding the elastic behavior of deformable strings, especially the second type involving mass redistribution, is crucial for enhancing comprehension in the study of biological filaments or fibers and soft matter. For instance, these investigations can contribute to understanding the mechanisms employed by cells to sense gravity or other mechanical conditions. © 2024 The Author(s).

The Gross-Pitaevskii equation plays a significant role in Bose-Einstein condensation and engineering, where it characterizes the dynamics of the condensate wave function. Superfluidity and superconductivity are two characteristics of the low-temperature phenomenon that are linked to the Bose-Einstein condensate, which is generated by a diluted atomic gas. The investigation of multi-component equations has garnered considerable attention because of their capacity to clarify intricate physical phenomena and reveal the dynamic configurations of localized wave solutions. A variety of solutions have been secured in various forms, including bright, dark, singular, and combo solitons, in addition to solutions of hyperbolic, periodic, and exponential functions. For the purpose of ensuring the solutions, recently developed integration tools called the modified Sardar subequation method and enhanced modified extended tanh-expansion method have been implemented. In nonlinear dispersive media, solitons are stretched electromagnetic waves that maintain their intensity due to a balance between the effects of dispersion and nonlinearity. The proposed approaches are certainly the most direct, efficient, and valuable method for dealing with multiple nonlinear models that arise in applied physics and mathematics, with the purpose of generating various types of exact solutions.

Real-world complex temporal networks are faced with many errors and attacks that cause the network structure to be changed in some way so that the controllability processes are disturbed and after that, the controllability robustness of the network decreases. One of the most important attacks on complex temporal networks is intelligent attacks. In this paper, the types of intelligent attacks and their destructive effects on the controllability of complex temporal networks have been investigated. In order to increase the controllability robustness of the network against intelligent attacks, a novel graphmodel and strategies have been proposed on complex dynamic graph by adding new control nodes or adding new links to the network so that the network is protected against intelligent attacks. The results of simulation and comparing them with conventional methods demonstrate that the proposed node addition strategy has performed better than other methods and the improvement rate in terms of execution time is 60%. On the other hand, the proposed immunization strategy by adding links has kept the network controllable with a smaller number of links (38%) and less execution time (52%) compared to other methods.  © TheAuthor2024."

In this paper, we develop a mathematical model that integrates hormonal treatment, immunotherapy, and the interactions among three cell types: drug-sensitive cancer cells, drug-resistant cancer cells and immune effector cells. Dynamical analysis is performed, examining the existence and stability of equilibria, thereby confirming the model's interpretability. Model parameters are calibrated using available prostate cancer data and literature. Through bifurcation analysis for drug sensitivity under different immune effector cells recruitment responses, we find that resistant cancer cells grow rapidly under weak recruitment response, maintain at a low level under strong recruitment response, and both may occur under moderate recruitment response. To quantify the competitiveness of sensitive and resistant cells, we introduce the comprehensive measures R1 and R2, respectively, which determine the outcome of competition. Additionally, we introduce the quantitative indicators CIE1 and CIE2 as comprehensive measures of the immune effects on sensitive and resistant cancer cells, respectively. These two indicators determine whether the corresponding cancer cells can maintain at a low level. Our work shows that the immune system is an important factor affecting the evolution of drug resistance and provides insights into how to enhance immune response to control resistance. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Due to clearance and contact effects, the supersonic slipper–track system displays pronounced nonlinearities. A comprehensive analysis, including bifurcation and chaos detection, is conducted on this system to predict the nonlinear behavior of the slipper. Kinematic and dynamic models of the system are established using the generalized coordinate and Lagrange multiplier methods. This model accounts for slipper–track clearances, track irregularities, and normal contact forces. The dynamic response of the slipper is examined both in time and frequency domain. The bifurcation analysis encompasses various parameters such as slipper velocity and length, and slipper–track clearance. Chaos identification is employed for both qualitative and quantitative assessments, utilizing phase diagrams, Poincaré sections, the trajectory of the slipper’s center, and the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE). The findings revealed significant nonlinear phenomena, including self-excited vibrations, superharmonic responses, jumping phenomena, strange attractors, and combined frequencies. Notably, this study demonstrated the potential for leveraging chaotic response to mitigate the contact forces on the slipper.

The dynamic characteristics of the system, including equilibrium points, Lyapunov exponent spectrum, bifurcation diagram, double-parameter Lyapunov exponent, and attractor basin, are analyzed. The results indicate that the Lyapunov exponents of the system undergo abrupt changes. The bifurcation diagrams reveal the occurrence of sudden cusp bifurcations, and the diverse manifestations of two-parameter Lyapunov exponents under different parameter combinations further underscore the system’s complexity and variability. This chaotic system also possesses an infinite number of equilibrium points and coexisting attractors, demonstrating multiple stable states. By adjusting parameters, multi-vortex chaotic attractors with high controllability can be generated, enabling the transition from two-vortex to four-vortex and then to multi-vortex chaotic systems. As the number of vortices increases, the system’s dynamic characteristics become richer and more complex. Introducing pulse functions has realized mirrored multi-vortex scroll chaotic attractors, further enhancing the chaotic characteristics of the system.

However, the majority of multi-objective algorithms (MOEAs) are unable to achieve good performance on the TREE problems due to their huge search space with complicated decision variable interactions. In this paper, we propose a problem knowledge driven bi-population cooperative framework, where the knowledge (i.e., the optimal values of most decision variables in each TREE problem are similar) is exploited to enhance the convergence of algorithm for the huge search space. The proposed framework holds a weak cooperation between two populations to achieve the assistance in tackling the original TREE problems. To this aim, when the proposed framework evolves one population by a general MOEA, it evolves the other population by a sparse MOEA to assist generation of solutions that have many similar decision variables, thus promoting the convergence towards the Pareto optimal fronts of TREE problems. In the experiments, we investigate the performance of the proposed framework on five TREE problems with their number of decision variables ranging from 3000 to 15000. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms seven competitors, both in terms of final results and convergence performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Specifically, it explored and identified: (1) the most common basic numeracy concepts taught, (2) additional training and resources to support numeracy teaching, (3) who is best placed to teach numeracy and (4) the preferred methods of teaching medication calculations. Background: Nurse academics are required to teach nursing numeracy to undergraduate nursing students who enter university unprepared to accurately calculate medication dosages. It is important that students understand numeracy concepts as this is then applied to contextualised clinical applications. Nurse academics teach basic numeracy; however, the literature reveals that nurse academics do not consider themselves mathematics teachers and that experts in this area are better suited to teaching this skill. There are a dearth of studies about the nurse academics who conduct the teaching and this study seeks to fill that gap by exploring firsthand the nurse academics’ self-reported insights into the teaching of undergraduate nursing numeracy. Design: Cross-sectional survey. The setting was Australian universities that deliver an accredited undergraduate nursing degree. Methods: Purposive sampling was used to recruit Australian nurse academics (n = 170), sessional or permanent who currently teach all aspects of nursing numeracy and medication calculations to undergraduate nursing students. Data were collected between Nov 2023 - Feb 2024 using an online survey platform and analysed using a descriptive content analysis. Results: Nurse academics taught basic arithmetic most commonly (92 %), yet most (90 %) had not received professional development or additional training in how to teach these concepts. To assist with numeracy teaching, resources were requested (47 %) as were the need for mathematics learning support staff (82 %). The formula method was most commonly taught (91 %), however, most participants (94 %) were willing to learn and to teach other methods of calculating medications. Conclusions: This research suggests an evidenced-based education framework be created to support and guide nurse academics when teaching all aspects of nursing numeracy and medication calculations. Building the teaching capacity of nurse academics in this vital area will enhance student competence and contribute to patient safety. © 2024 The Authors"

However, exact inference on BNs is time-consuming, especially for complex problems, which hinders the widespread adoption of BNs. To improve the efficiency, we propose a fast BN exact inference named Faster-BNI on multi-core CPUs. Faster-BNI enhances the efficiency of a well-known BN exact inference algorithm, namely the junction tree algorithm, through hybrid parallelism that tightly integrates coarse- and fine-grained parallelism. Moreover, we identify that the bottleneck of BN exact inference methods lies in recursively updating the potential tables of the network. To reduce the table update cost, Faster-BNI employs novel optimizations, including the reduction of potential tables and re-organizing the potential table storage, to avoid unnecessary memory consumption and simplify potential table operations. Comprehensive experiments on real-world BNs show that the sequential version of Faster-BNI outperforms existing sequential implementation by 9 to 22 times, and the parallel version of Faster-BNI achieves up to 11 times faster inference than its parallel counterparts.  © 1990-2012 IEEE."

Using PISA 2018 data, a model including three layers of the ecological model were constructed to examine the ecological background of math performance for each group: exceptionally low & high achievers. Employing structural equation modeling, the results revealed that high math performance was ecologically associated with factors: attitudes towards competition, growth mindset, motivation to master tasks, self-efficacy, teacher enthusiasm, teacher feedback, teacher support, value of school, and parents' emotional support. However, low math performance was related to a wider range of factors, including the aforementioned variables, as well as enjoyment of reading and learning goals. This research emphasizes a practical viewpoint that suggests using different interventions to maximize the potential of students in various positions on the math ability spectrum since the factors differ in explaining mathematically high and low performance. Educational relevance and implications statement: In this study, we investigated motivation related factors that affect students with both high and low achievements in mathematics. Our results indicate that the factors associated with math performance differ between high and low achievers. This highlights the significance of need for differentiated educational strategies to maximize the potential of students across the math ability spectrum.

Traditionally, MLD is identified based on arithmetic fluency. However, number processing skills are suggested to differentiate low achievement (LA) from MLD. Aims: This study investigated the accuracy of number processing skills in identifying students with MLD and LA, based on arithmetic fluency, and whether the classification ability of number processing skills varied as a function of grade level. Methods and procedures: The participants were 18,405 students (girls = 9080) from Grades 3–9 (ages 9–15). Students’ basic numerical skills were assessed with an online dyscalculia screener (Functional Numeracy Assessment –Dyscalculia Battery, FUNA-DB), which included number processing and arithmetic fluency as two factors. Outcomes and results: Confirmatory factor analyses supported a two-factor structure of FUNA-DB. The two-factor structure was invariant across language groups, gender, and grade levels. Receiver operating characteristics curve analyses indicated that number processing skills are a fair classifier of MLD and LA status across grade levels.

It is significant important to monitor wetland ecosystem using remote sensing technology. However, the complexity, fuzziness, and spatial heterogeneity of wetlands increase the difficulty of wetland classification, leading to the problem that the classification accuracy is not high enough to satisfy the needs of in-depth research. At present, the classification of wetlands is mainly based on pixel based- and image object based- methods. Addressing the problems of traditional pixel based- and image object based- methods, this study proposes to utilize fuzzy geospatial objects to express wetland objects. By synthesizing the spectral features, shape features, texture features, fuzziness and other features of wetland objects, a hierarchical classification method based on fuzzy geospatial objects is proposed. Taking Tianjin Binhai New Area as the study area, Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing images are utilized for verification. The main contents of this study and its results are as follows: (1) Extract the fuzzy geospatial objects of wetlands and construct the classification feature sets. (2) To simplify the classification problem, a hierarchical classification framework based on optimizing multiple attributes using Random Forest is proposed. By this method, the problems of difficulty in distinguishing wetlands and low classification accuracy caused by similarity of spectral features of wetland objects in the traditional single layer classification method are solved. Three experiments are designed in the study to verify the effects of the fuzzy geospatial objects of wetlands and the hierarchical classification method on the classification accuracy of wetlands, respectively. The results show that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the proposed hierarchical wetland classification method based on fuzzy geospatial objects are 94.35% and 0.899, respectively, which are 12.35% and 0.183 higher than those of the traditional image object based- methods. © 2024"

Studies have documented intraindividual strategy variability and its significance for learning, but only some have addressed the interindividual strategic diversity across students within a classroom. This study analyzed classroom strategy diversity using assessments of 527 kindergartens to 2nd-grade students. Latent growth modeling analysis revealed that the best fit was a spline model featuring two phases of linear growth with different growth rates (i.e., one in Kindergarten, the other from Kindergarten spring to second grade). A growth mixture modeling analysis demonstrated that only one latent class existed within the data, which supports the homogeneity of the identified growth trajectory among students. We also analyzed the relations of their learning to the interindividual strategy diversity in their classrooms via a multilevel latent growth model. The results showed that early encouragement of student-generated strategies and later guidance toward research-based effective strategies most supported mathematical growth. This finding aligned with the previous work regarding classroom strategic diversity. Educational relevance and implications statement: Developing solution strategies is an important mathematical goal. Do children benefit from being in classrooms using diverse strategies or a smaller range of efficient strategies? Does this depend on children's phase of learning?

In this study, a novel tri-objective location-allocation optimization model is specifically developed for designing a sustainable apparel CLSC, incorporating the industry's unique facilities. The aim of the model is to simultaneously minimize the costs and negative environmental impacts while maximizing social benefits under demands and returns uncertainty. A notable research contribution lies in addressing the unique challenges of treating different types of returns, including commercial, End Of Use (EOU) and End Of Life (EOL) returns due to their uncertain quality and quantity. Additionally, the model optimizes the environmental performance levels of production facilities, a novel aspect in the apparel CLSC research. Moreover, the flexibility of constraints related to the demand fulfilment is considered. To cope with such flexibility and uncertainties, a new hybrid robust possibilistic flexible programming model is developed, by extending the previous methodologies. A core innovation of this solution approach lies in the pioneering utilization of hexagonal fuzzy numbers for uncertain epistemic parameters, making a significant advancement in the field of CLSC. Comparative analysis with the similar studies demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model, incorporating hexagonal fuzzy numbers over the method using triangular fuzzy numbers. Furthermore, AUGMECON method using lexicographic optimization is applied to handle the multi-objective model. The application of the proposed model is shown focusing on Southwestern Ontario in Canada. The results reveal that commercial and EOU returns have a more detrimental impact on economic, environmental, and social sustainability aspects compared to EOL returns. © 2024 The Authors"

These networks have been widely applied in the tactile perception field. However, due to the sparsity of tactile data, these models are prone to generalization issues. Additionally, existing methods for tactile graph construction are constrained when spatially connecting high-dimensional tactile data, making it challenging for the model to fuse and process such information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the GGT-SNN, which introduces a parameter estimation method with Gaussian priors to alleviate generalization problems caused by sparse tactile data. Furthermore, we design M-tree and Z-tree tactile graph construction methods to compensate for deficiencies of other approaches when handling high-dimensional tactile spatial connections. This approach enhances the model's ability to efficiently process high-dimensional event-driven tactile information. We introduce an approximate LIF neuron activation function to enable backpropagation within the model and comprehensively compare and evaluate its performance against different approximate functions.

This study examines the abilities of 60 pre-service mathematics teachers (PSTs) in identifying content and context within mathematical word problems. Utilizing a case study approach, the study employed the mathematics word problems test and the content and context questionnaire. The findings reveal that PSTs generally struggle with error detection and content comprehension in mathematical word problems, as demonstrated by their inability to recognize inaccuracies in two of three test questions. The failure of PSTs to identify errors in mathematical word problems often stems from their tendency to rely solely on the solutions they obtain, without first understanding the entire question presented. In essence, they may focus on finding a solution rather than critically evaluating the problem, which can lead to the oversight of errors or inaccuracies within the problem statement itself. This study emphasizes the need for PSTs to grasp mathematical concepts and contextualize them in everyday life scenarios. Challenges were observed in linking computational results to real-world contexts. Thus, the study calls for future research in pre-service teacher education to explore strategies for enhancing critical thinking, error detection, and the integration of practical context in mathematical problem-solving. Furthermore, the study suggests that assessing the ability of PSTs to formulate problem-solving questions evaluates their capacity to answer questions and their ability to construct questions that can enhance students’ cognitive abilities. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Nevertheless, several issues in the current MPQUIC specification remain inadequately addressed. Congestion control in MPQUIC primarily relies on packet loss and favors paths with lower drop rates, which results in significant throughput degradation, especially in heterogeneous wireless networks with frequent random packet loss and varying path characteristics. Additionally, network fairness principles limits its performance, even in scenarios with independent and non-shared bottleneck paths. A final issue is that packet scheduling in dynamic and asymmetric paths poses a significant challenge, potentially causing out-of-order (OFO) arrivals and Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking if not appropriately managed. Inspired by Google's BBR algorithm, this paper introduces a novel scheme called Shared Bottleneck and BBR-based Congestion Control (S2B2C) to address the above issues. It identifies subsets of subflows that share common bottlenecks within the MPQUIC connection based on the BBR's internal mechanism. The scheme dynamically adjusts the pacing rate of these subflows to enhance goodput while preserving fairness with legacy single-path flows. Then, to mitigate inter-stream and intra-stream HoL blocking caused by OFO arrivals over asymmetric paths, we present a fine-grained Stream-path-bounded Priority-based Packet Scheduler (S2PS), which includes a stream dependency tree, a priority-based queuing, and a packet scheduling algorithm that uses a mixed-integer program formulation. Experimental results show that S2B2C achieves higher throughput while maintaining bottleneck fairness, and S2PS effectively mitigates HoL blocking with fewer OFO arrivals and shorter flow completion time compared to existing MPQUIC schemes in heterogeneous networks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The motion of air around such circular cylindrical structures and the helicopter presents interesting phenomena including flow separation, wakes and turbulence. The physics of these are enshrined in the continuity equation and the Navier-Stokes equations. Therefore, their studies are not only important in mathematics and physics, but they are also required for efficient helicopter operations. In practice, reduced-order models of these operations that take in aerodynamics models of the tethered loads are utilized for stability analysis, flight certification and pilot training because of the prohibitive cost of experimentation and computational analyses of these configurations. However, there is a dearth of realistic analytical models of finite cylinder flows because of the Navier-Stokes problem. Classical potential flow theory provides an avenue to develop such models, but the extant gaps in its predictions significantly preclude its usage for engineering applications. Attempting to bridge these gaps, this article introduces refined potential flow theory in which the governing equations and boundary conditions are satisfied. Viscous effects, fluctuations of the mean flow and three-dimensional effects are also incorporated. For characterization, refined potential flow theory is employed on an incompressible flow over an impulsively started circular cylinder for Reynolds numbers and non-dimensional times in the range 30 < Re < 10 4 and 0.2 ≤ T ≤ 77, 047 respectively. There is an excellent prediction of 0.209 for the Strouhal number at Re = 3 , 900 . At this transitional Reynolds number, the harmonics of the Strouhal frequency are also captured, and the characteristic irregular fluctuations at sub-Strouhal frequencies are discernible in the velocity spectra. As the flow becomes more turbulent, these become more pronounced at Re = 9 , 500 when the predicted Strouhal number is within 10% of experimental result. In the fully developed stage, spectra analyses of the wake velocity components at some downstream locations also display Kolmogorov's Five-Thirds law of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The present model can thus aid the development of reduced-order models of helicopter operations that feature tethered cylindrical loads. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd"

On the other hand, as recently discussed by Sutradhar (2022, Sankhya B,84, 259-302), in the fixed models setup the modelling of cluster correlations can be complex. In the finite population (FP) setup where FP data follow a SP model but the regression effects estimation is done using a two-stage cluster sample, the inferences become much more complex. As opposed to the recent mixed models based FP inferences (Sutradhar 2023b, Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics,75, 425-462), there does not appear any studies for fixed models based analysis for exponential family data where true correlation structures play important role in defining FP regression parameters. To resolve this inference issue, in this paper we make following specific contributions. First, the cluster correlations for linear, counts and binary data are developed in a SP setup such that the marginal mean models depend only on the fixed regression effects. Second the FP data which are hypothetical or unobserved until a sample is taken to observe a part, are utilized to develop hypothetical estimating equations for the SP regression parameters, which subsequently define the FP regression and correlation parameters. Third, the design weighted unbiased estimators are obtained for the FP regression and correlation parameters, where the specific formulas for correlation estimators depend on the nature of the response data whether linear, counts or binary. Also, as an additional application of the regression effects estimation, the FP total prediction is discussed. Next, the design consistency of the regression estimators is developed in details. © Indian Statistical Institute 2024."

Dyeing for polyester fabrics has a huge demand. Given that dyeing is one of the least environmentally friendly industrial processes, decreasing the attempts for dyeing (a.k.a realizing “one-shot” successful dyeing) is of vital importance to the dyeing manufacturing for polyester fabrics. This can be achieved by accurately predicting the dye concentrations for a dyeing recipe with provided target color information on the polyester fabrics. In this paper, we report a data-driven approach for accurately predicting industrial dyeing recipes of polyester fabrics. We intensively discuss the data preprocessing skills for this purpose. We show that log-transform and using full reflectance spectra for the color as input are two effective preprocessing techniques to improve the model performance. An effective model based on gradient-boosting regression tree (GBRT) has been developed to quantitatively model the relationship between the colorimetric information and the dye concentrations of industrial dyeing data of polyester fabrics.

The problems of identifying significant classes of functions that can be so extended and of defining integration for them have proven to be formidable. In this paper we address this and related unresolved issues by showing that extensions to No, and thereby integrals, exist for most functions arising in practical applications. In particular, we show they exist for a large subclass of the resurgent functions, a subclass that contains the functions that at ∞ are semi-algebraic, semi-analytic, analytic, meromorphic, and Borel summable as well as solutions to nonresonant linear and nonlinear meromorphic systems of ODEs or of difference equations. By suitable changes of variables we deal with arbitrarily located singular points. We further establish a sufficient condition for the theory to carry over to ordered exponential subfields of No more generally and illustrate the result with structures familiar from the surreal literature. The extensions of functions and integrals that concern us are constructive in nature, which permits us to work in NBG less the Axiom of Choice (for both sets and proper classes). Following the completion of the positive portion of the paper, it is shown that the existence of such constructive extensions and integrals of substantially more general types of functions (e.g. smooth functions) is obstructed by considerations from the foundations of mathematics. © 2024"

Also, the eccentric version of the extended adjacency matrix is defined. We establish several results regarding the properties of the extended eccentric matrix and spectra of different classes of graphs including trees and unicyclic graphs. Some new bounds also for the minimum spectral radius of the extended eccentric matrices were determined. Besides, we present bounds for the extended eccentric spectral radius of path graph and prove that the maximum value of the extended eccentric spectral radius in a tree is attained by the star graph. In our research, we explore the potential applications of the SDE index in chemical graph theory. Our findings illustrate a noteworthy correlation between the SDE index and several physical and chemical properties. This correlation highlights the promising potential of the index as a predictive tool for the molecular behavior of various compounds. For example, the SDE index has a stronger negative correlation with the M1, M2, and M3 indices (r= −0.93, −0.94, and −0.91, respectively). © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Besides a few studies, research focusing on real terrain environments and non-linear dynamics for multiple large unmanned aircraft operations for high-speed maneuvers remains lacking. This study proposes an integrated framework that includes mission planning for low-level flight control laws in 3D terrain environments with complex non-linear flight dynamics. A genetic algorithm with double chromosomes was used for task allocation, and a rapidly exploring random tree star with a line-of-sight path optimization method was used for fast and optimal path planning. Further, spline interpolation was applied to generate flyable paths and trajectory commands for control laws. A demonstration was performed based on non-linear flight dynamics with incremental backstepping-based trajectory tracking control laws. In addition to integrating these methods, a trajectory envelope was introduced to consider the effects of the complex non-linear dynamics. The integrated method predicts whether the given trajectory will be stable for the selected rotorcraft unmanned aerial vehicles by checking the trajectory before the flight and converting it to a continuous connection of the maneuver library using flight regime recognition. Based on this simulation, the proposed framework for multiple aircraft operations with 3D terrain and non-linear flight dynamics proves its capabilities. © ICROS, KIEE and Springer 2024."

Our focus is put on the heterogeneity of land with respect to types and regions, at the core of an inherent aggregation problem. We propose an axiomatic characterization of the ecological footprint index with two fundamentally new axioms, symmetry and independence, which can resolve the problem of land heterogeneity. It is shown that a unique index, up to an affine transformation, exists meeting the axiom system. This index simplifies the aggregation procedure considerably and avoids the need for a synthetic unit of measurement, like global hectares, as well as complex transformations of variables by means of weighting schemes. Our findings reveal differences with the Global Footprint Network (GFN) index, in particular with regard to the treatment of land heterogeneity.

Jiskani et al. applied their proposed approach to the surface quarries to analyze the mine health and safety (MHS) risk in the surface mines and quarries in Pakistan. Mine managers of other developing countries may be attracted towards ZNBFFTA to analyze MHS risk in the surface mines and quarries. ZNBFFTA can be used in a variety of sectors and is highly effective. It is pertinent to mention that although ZNBFFTA towards the problem of MHS is valid. However, in Step 4 of ZNBFFTA, Kang et al.’s method (Journal of Information & Computational Science 9(3) (2012) 703–709) is used to transform Z-number (ZN) into fuzzy number (FN) as no other method was available at that time.

The results of PSA are used by designers, utilities and regulatory body to confirm the reactor design, to change operation procedures, to enhance the reliability of safety systems, or to modify regulation. Fault tree analysis (FTA) has been used as a deductive means for PSA. System components are assumed to always have defined failure probabilities; however, in reality this assumption is questionable and sometimes there is insufficient data about the failure probability of some components. To solve this problem, fuzzy approaches have been proposed and implemented. The aim of this study is to apply a fuzzy reliability algorithm to estimate basic events failure probabilities for the shutdown system of a research reactor. The reactor is a 22 MW light water open pool type material test reactor and the shutdown system is responsible for the fast shutdown of the reactor whenever safety limits are exceeded. Then, to illustrate the ability of the algorithm, the results are compared with real basic event failure probabilities. The results verify the competence of the algorithm and confirm that it can be applied as an alternative method when quantitative data are not available. Also, a risk importance measure is done on the fault tree of the shutdown system to illustrate which components need to be focused for improvements to achieve the safe operation of shutdown system. © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

In this respect, improving the resiliency of transportation systems under uncertainty is a controversial global challenge that this study could underpin. To do so, a systematic literature review (SLR) extracted a list of resiliency factors for resilient transportation systems. Next, a novel version of spherical fuzzy Delphi (SFD) screened factors, considering the case of Iran's international maritime transportation system. Moreover, the causal network relationship of the finalised factors was analysed by a novel hybrid spherical fuzzy approach, including a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and the analytic network process (ANP). Later, the unexpected events that occurred after 2000 were investigated. The SLR deeply investigated 51 of the top relevant articles. As a result, 12 factors and 22 subfactors that affect transportation systems resiliency were extracted. Notably, the rest of the findings primarily apply to the Iranian context. By implementing the SFD, ten factors were screened for Iran's international maritime transportation system and then analysed by SF-DEMATEL. After, the analysed factors were weighted by SFANP, where “recoverability” was selected as the most critical factor, and the “technological and communicational” factor was chosen as the least critical factor. Furthermore, the results provide a critical analysis of the policies adopted by Iran's international maritime transportation system to enhance resiliency under disruptive events. © 2024 The Author(s)"

The fluids under consideration are Newtonian fluids with the Prandtl number (Pr) and Lewis number (Le) in the ranges of 0.01≤Pr≤10 and 0.001≤Le≤1, respectively. Extensive direct numerical simulations are conducted to explore the dynamics of the system by varying the control parameters, namely, the relative Rayleigh number (r) and the inclination angle of the cavity (β) together with the separation ratio (ψ) in the ranges of 1.0≤r≤2.0, 0°≤β≤90°, and −0.6≤ψ≤0. It is found that the inclination angle leads to a distinct trend for heat and mass transfer: the Nusselt number first decreases for small β, then gradually increases for moderate β, and finally decreases again for large β when r varies from 1.4 to 2.0. The optimal inclination angle lies in the range of 54°≤β∗≤64°, where the heat transport peaks. The Sherwood number initially decreases for small β, then increases with increasing β, and finally remains constant for large β. We present the bifurcation diagram of the solutions for different separation ratios, focusing on the distinct variation trends of the inclination angle. The corresponding heat- and mass-transfer properties of the flow on different branches of the bifurcation diagram are investigated. Furthermore, we explore the effect of the relative Rayleigh number, Prandtl number and Lewis number as well as the separation ratio on heat and mass transfer for various inclination angles, and obtain the Nusselt number as a function of the separation ratio and inclination angle. © 2023"

One of the most popular ways for airline companies to gauge customer satisfaction (CS) and determine what needs to be improved is by conducting surveys of their customers. In this study, we used an extended version of the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) technique, which is one of the most important multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, with type-2 fuzzy sets to evaluate PS for the first time in the literature. Using this systematic technique, we have reflected to the model the uncertainty that may affect the evaluations of the passengers when making their assessments. Our study is considerably beneficial since it enables not only the PS evaluation of airline companies but also it is a generalization to analyze any type of CS that may be found in the aviation sector. We used our technique on questionnaires answered by 129,880 US Airlines passengers concerning 14 criteria and compared our results with studies in the literature using the same dataset. Unlike the literature, in this paper, passenger segmentation has been done to obtain effective results. Different scenarios are created for each emerging segment. While creating the scenarios, the passenger profiles of overall satisfaction, flight class, and customer loyalty are considered and different priorities are given to these variables in each scenario. We have utilized these scenarios to help airlines determine the demands of each consumer segment to improve service quality. Our study provides airline companies with an integrated decision system, with a holistic perspective, in which they can take into account not only their customers as one type, but also the differences they may experience in evaluating both their flight habits and flight experiences. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

We show that bifurcating solitary waves are spectrally stable when the phase angle satisfies θ∈(0,π), while unstable waves are found for angles θ∈(π,2π).

In this paper, we aim to investigate the impact of random perturbations on the hormesis Ricker model by considering control measures applied within each generation which can generate hormetic effects, where randomness is characterized by a uniform discrete distribution and white noise, respectively. The main results indicate that the addition of discrete randomness will make the model appear with blurred orbits when the intrinsic growth rate is large enough. The position of the random variable, at the end of each generation or within each generation, cause the blurred orbits to exhibit various forms. Moreover, the effects of variances and expectations of the discrete uniform random variable on the dynamics are evaluated. Further, the introduction of randomness increases the hormetic zone and the maximum response, but can increase or decrease the monotonically increasing interval under different parameter values. In contrast, the stochastic model characterized by white noise, exhibits only a small effect on the bifurcation diagrams with respect to the intrinsic growth rate and the hormesis, which may be attributed to the mean of its noise being zero. Finally, we fit the stochastic model to experimental hormetic data sets observed in multiple fields, and our results demonstrate that the stochastic hormesis Ricker model can capture the characteristics of these data accurately. These findings could provide valuable insights into the understanding of the complexities of pest population dynamics, with implications for better pest control, resource management and for other complex biological systems such as toxicology and drug development. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Experiments shew that the drilling torque linear increases with depth initially, followed by bifurcation. The bifurcation types are intricately linked to the motion parameters of the rotor, while the depth of bifurcation and saturated torque are directly influenced by rotor geometry. DEM simulations link torque bifurcation to a low-stress fluidized region around the rotor, while the region is enclosed by a fluid–solid interface and influenced by the motion parameters. Moreover, force chain analysis demonstrates the irreversible state change of granular media disturbed by the rotor. Leveraging these insights, we propose two scaling laws quantifying the bifurcation point depth and the saturated torque, then perform qualitative analysis to explain the experimental phenomena.

Therefore, here magnetohydrodynamic micropolar nanofluid flow towards the stretching surface with artificial neural network has been considered. In this study, radiation and heat source phenomena have been presented in heat convection. Brownian and thermophoresis effects and micro-rotational particles are also taking into account. The non-linear simplified equations have been calculated numerically via Runge-Kutta fourth-order shooting process. The calculation of the Sherwood number, Nusselt number, couple stress coefficient, and skin friction coefficient has been conducted utilizing diverse parameters. Furthermore, the outcomes have been employed to create four distinct artificial neural networks. Our observation indicates that an increase in the heat source quantity (Formula presented.) leads to a rise in heat generation, resulting in a greater total heat output and an increase in the temperature field.

In recent years, enabled by the new generation of information technology, represented by the digital twin (DT), the digitalization of MRCMfg has progressed steadily. However, more complex manufacturing tasks and more customized manufacturing demands pose challenges to MRCMfg, which limit the applicability of MRCMfg in practice. Recent successes in intelligent manufacturing show that empowering DT with the intelligence and cognition capabilities to adapt to the above challenges is a promising approach. Inspired by that, a cognitive digital twin (CDT) framework with multiple artificial intelligence algorithms for MRCMfg is proposed. The framework consists of three critical spaces: (i) Physical-virtual space: multi-agent system-based DT; (ii) Cognition space: multi-behavior tree (BT) cognition models; (iii) Data space: data-driven cognition evolution. In the data space, multimodal perception is a important way to improve the cognition capabilities of MRCMfg. To alleviate the multimodal data quality requirements as well as to improve the robustness of the perception model, an incomplete multimodal Transformer with deep autoencoder (IMTDAE) approach is proposed. The effectiveness and feasibility of this framework and IMTDAE are verified by case studies.

The purpose of this investigation is to explore the early identification and treatment of conjunctivitis adenovirus by introducing vaccination methods for asymptomatic individuals. A mathematical model is constructed with the aim of strengthening the immune system. The ABC operator is then utilized to convert the model into a fractionally ordered one. The developed system is analyzed with analytical solutions by employing Sumudu transforms, including convergence analysis. The boundedness and uniqueness of the model are investigated using Banach space, which are key properties of such epidemic models. The uniqueness of the system is confirmed to ensure it has a unique solution. The stability of the newly constructed SEVIR system is investigated both qualitatively and statistically, and the system’s flip bifurcation has been verified. The developed system is examined through a Lyapunov function-based local and global stability study. The solution to the system is found using the Atangana-Toufik technique, a sophisticated method for reliable bounded solutions, employing various fractional values. Error analysis has also been conducted for the scheme. Simulations have been carried out to observe the real behavior and effects of the conjunctivitis virus, confirming that individuals with a strong immune response can recover without medication during the acute stage of infection. This helps to understand the real situation regarding the control of conjunctivitis adenovirus after early detection and treatment by introducing vaccination measures due to the strong immune response of the patients. Such investigations are useful for understanding the spread of the disease and for developing control strategies based on the justified outcomes. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd."

We investigate the existence and global attractivity of both trivial and semi-trivial steady-state solutions and the existence and local stability of coexistence steady-state solutions, depending on the size of a key principal eigenvalue. In addition, we show that the effect of advection on the principal eigenvalue is monotonic for small advection rates, depending on the concavity of the resource distribution. For arbitrary advection rates, we consider two explicit resource distributions for which we can say precisely the behaviour of the principal eigenvalue as it depends on advection, highlighting that advection can either improve or impair a population’s ability to persist, depending on the characteristics of the resource distribution. We present some numerical simulations to demonstrate the outcomes as they depend on the advection rates for the full predator–prey system. These insights highlight the intimate relationship between environmental heterogeneity, directed movement, and the hostile boundary.

The governing equation is very important because it is use to interpret wave propagation in microstructured solids. By the use of Sub-ODE technique, the different categories of solitons including periodic solitons, rational solitons, dark solitons, bright solitons, travelling waves, trigonometric, and Weierstrass elliptic function are obtained. The main purpose behind the sub-ODE method is to find the soliton solutions of a nonlinear model by using simple and solvable ODEs called sub-ODEs. Additionally, the various exact solutions in the form of rational, exponential, hyperbolic, and trigonometric functions are derived using the Exp(-ϕ(η))-expansion technique. Variants wave results are found from the exact propagating wave solution by changing the parameters to varied values. To better comprehend the physical phenomena of the micro-structured solids wave model, several solutions have been illustrated graphically. The findings demonstrate how the system parameters, which can be employed as system controllers, affect the wave solutions dynamics. According to these findings, the sub-ODE and Exp(-ϕ(η))-expansion methods are simpler, more efficient, and more powerful mathematical tools for determining the exact solitary solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations that occur in the fields of engineering, mathematics, physics, fluid mechanics, materials science, fiber optics, and many other natural sciences. Using mathematical software, the obtained results have been validated by inserting them into the governing equation. Therefore, our methods based on the foundation of representative computations provide a rigorous and efficient mathematical implementation for solving complex nonlinear wave problems. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature India Private Limited 2024."

This issue begins early in education and worsens as females progress into more senior roles. To address this gap, we designed and implemented the Biomechanics Research and Innovation Challenge (BRInC), a 100-day STEM program focused on mentoring and role modelling to engage high school girls and early-career biomechanists at key phases where they most commonly disengage in STEM. We evaluated the influence of the program on (i) identity and perceptions towards science, engineering, and biomechanics; (ii) attitudes towards biomechanics, maths and science; and (iii) attitudes towards gender bias, education and career aspirations in STEM, within high school girls following participation in the BRInC program. We observed significant and positive shifts in girls’ perceptions of both biomechanics and engineering. Participation in the program appeared to lead to favourable shifts in attitudes towards biomechanics, maths, and science and fostered a positive influence on girls’ education and career aspirations, igniting an interest in future research opportunities. Innovative STEM engagement programs, such as BRInC, highlight the promising potential of targeted and bespoke approaches to address the underrepresentation of females in biomechanics and STEM-related education and careers. Future programs should strive to enhance socioeconomic and cultural diversity, employ whole of life-cycle approaches by offering programs for girls and women at various phases of the STEM pathway, and prioritize impact assessments to effectively monitor progress. © 2024 The Authors"

This paper presented an effective strategy for the rapid classification and determination of the compliance of diesel by using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, coupled with Tree-based feature selection (Tree) and popular ensemble learning frameworks. To verify the extrapolation and adaptability of ensemble learning, the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) which serve as baselines and their combination models with Tree method were developed to establish the models for the classification of diesel brands (case 1: −10#, −20#, −35#, −50# and inferior diesel) and alcohols diesel types (case 2: methanol diesel, ethanol diesel and pure diesel). Satisfactory results showed that all models have achieved acceptable classification results in the above two cases, especially the accuracy of Tree-LightGBM can reach more than 97 % without being affected by data imbalance and spectral overlap. The proposed approach that uses the NIR spectroscopy for diesel brands and types classification can be highly recommended as a practical, convenient, environment friendly and reliable solution for the routine monitoring of diesel market. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Specifically, the proposed algorithm generates two-dimensional optimal trajectories for CAVs with car-following relationships cooperatively within a complex road geometry. By extending the simplified Newell's car-following model, we propose a two-dimensional Newell's car-following model as an equilibrium car-following policy for CAVs. Based on this, a multi-objective constrained optimization is systematically formulated under a Cartesian coordinate. Due to the constraint's complexity, a new solving algorithm based on the rapid random tree (RRT) technique is proposed. To test the effectiveness of our proposed models and algorithm, numerical simulation experiments with a real-world road geometry are conducted. Results indicate that our proposed method is able to generate trajectories for CAV platoons which are close to the equilibrium condition with smooth controls, while avoiding road obstacles. We further extend the definition of a one-dimensional car-following control string stability to a two-dimensional case. By this definition, we find that the proposed method can achieve empirical two-dimensional string stability, ensuring that both lateral and longitudinal disturbances are attenuated through vehicular strings. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

It is observed for the first time that they both first increase with density, then there is not much variation and a clear sideband in the frequency spectrum is also observed when the density is up to 4 × 10 19 m − 3 , suggesting a change in the PDI channel. Calculation of the mode growth rate driven by PDI shows that when the edge electron density is up to 1.9 × 10 18 m − 3 , the growth rate of the ion cyclotron quasi-mode (ICQM) will exceed that of the ion sound quasi-mode (ISQM), quantitively explaining that with an increase in density, the PDI channel partly transits from the ISQM to the ICQM channel. Studies provide a possible way to reduce the power deposition in the edge region and improve drive capability by means of mitigating PDI behavior. © 2024 The Author(s).

These inaccuracies can jeopardize the groundwater system, leading to reduced efficiency and potentially causing partial or complete failures in the monitoring system. Traditional anomaly detection methods, which rely on statistical and time-variant techniques, struggle to handle the complex and dynamic nature of anomalies. With advancements in artificial intelligence and the growing need for effective anomaly detection and prevention across different sectors, artificial neural network methods are emerging as capable of identifying more intricate anomalies by considering both temporal and contextual aspects. Nonetheless, there is still a shortage of comprehensive studies on groundwater anomaly detection. The intricate patterns of sequential data from groundwater present numerous challenges, necessitating sophisticated modeling techniques that combine mathematics, statistics, and machine learning for viable solutions. This paper introduces a model designed for high accuracy and efficient computation in detecting anomalies in groundwater monitoring data through a probabilistic approach. We employed the Monte Carlo method and SEAWAT numerical simulation to ascertain the uncertainty in groundwater salinity. Subsequently, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-Autoencoder model was trained and evaluated, forming the basis of an anomaly detection framework. Each piece of training data was assessed by the LSTM-Autoencoder using the Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) score and a predefined threshold to determine the data’s abnormality percentage. The accuracy evaluation of the proposed LSTM-Autoencoder algorithm revealed that this approach achieved commendable performance, with an accuracy of 98.47% in anomaly detection.

The overall irrigation water supply is based on scarce conventional water resources that are being depleted at an increasing pace due to climate change impacts in B. Menderes. The inclusive objective of this research is to pave the way for a “water efficiency action plan” incorporating non-conventional (alternative) water resources for irrigation in Soke Plain to address adaptive management. Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) principles help decision makers (DMs) to identify and apply the most adequate alternatives among other possible ones in resource planning processes. Therefore, the preference ranking of DMs among possible water resource alternatives for irrigation is vital for implementation. This paper marks the first instance of using a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method to evaluate both conventional and non-conventional water resource alternatives for cotton irrigation. The evaluation and ranking of water resource alternatives is processed using the hybrid MCDM method, integration of “Hesitant Fuzzy-Analytic Hierarchy Process” (HF-AHP) and “Hesitant Fuzzy Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution” (HF-EDAS), namely HF-AHP-EDAS. This procedure implies several possibly contradictory qualitative and quantitative criteria, incorporates ambiguity, vagueness, and hesitancy in decision-makers’ decisions, and achieves a consistent, dependable ranking of alternatives. Eight different water resources for irrigation are evaluated by 5 experts, for 15 assessment criteria, in Soke Plain. Conventional water resources blended with drainage water is concluded to be the best irrigation water resource alternative, with HF-AHP-EDAS and also with HF-AHP-PROMETHEE II (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enriching Evaluations II), that is used for comparison analysis. This choice aligns well with the outlined arguments, culminating in an overall result deemed compliant with the field survey. © 2024 The Authors"

This book rediscovers Moretti's personal impact on international architectural theory through thoughtful comments that shed light on the architect's modernity and original approach. Although Moretti is an architect renowned for his projects and buildings, his theoretical essays are less well-known. The aim of this book is therefore to explore Moretti's theoretical work, which covers many topics, including pictorial art, sculpture, architecture, urban planning, music, cinema, poetry, mathematics, computer science, parametricity. In addition to the translation from Italian to English, the book contains reproductions of the original articles, accompanied by a series of essays of critical commentary and updated interpretations that show new ways of approaching, reading, and understanding the foundations of current architectural theory and its progress over the last 50 years. This book approaches Moretti's thought from a new perspective, with the aim of reconsidering the originality of this brilliant and visionary architect who was intellectually ostracised for many years due to political and ideological contingencies, even though he personified the ideal of the 'Renaissance man' in modern times. A re-reading of Moretti's work is more justified today than has ever been before, both to reconnect the threads with contemporaneity and to make his intensity and farsightedness of vision known to researchers, teachers, and students working in the areas of architecture and design theory, technology, and art today. © 2024 Roberto Podda.

These capture the current and synaptic transmission between neurons through mathematical equations, thus reflecting the signal transmission and integration in biological neuronal networks. This paper presents a five-dimensional isomorphic memristor coupled adaptive synaptic neuron (mCASN) network using a non-ideal memristor to couple two-dimensional adaptive synaptic neurons. The theoretical analysis of equilibrium points shows that the mCASN network has many different stability types. The complex parameters-dependent bifurcation behaviors are studied using various numerical methods, and the initial state-dependent coexistence behaviors and the riddled-like basins of attraction sensitive to initial states are further revealed, which proves that the coupled network has multistability. In addition, using the normalized average synchronization error method, we reveal that the mCASN network has synchronization characteristics controlled by parameters and initial states. The complete synchronization and lag synchronization induced by the network parameters, the internal variable of the coupled memristor, and the state variable of the sub-neuron are numerically analyzed. Finally, the mCASN network is implemented using an MCU-based digital hardware platform, and the numerical results are verified. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

In response, this paper introduces a novel approach employing data-driven models for super real-time prediction of thermal stratification. Themodel aims to enhance the efficiency and speed of thermal stratification predictions. Refined flow field data were first obtained via CFD, revealing the transition mechanism between the dominant roles of inertial and buoyancy forces during thermal stratification formation. To select the optimal data-driven model, this paper employs the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method to evaluate three algorithms - k-nearest neighbor (KNN), classification and regression tree (CART), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) - basedon temperature data from a temperature probe.

Samples are immobilized by vitrification and this sample can be maintained at liquid nitrogen temperatures in the vacuum of the electron microscope with negligible sublimation. Due to the low electron doses needed to avoid radiation damage, averaging over tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of particle images is used to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio. An alternative approach has been proposed where samples are at room temperature in the liquid state, maintained in the vacuum of the electron microscope by thin film enclosures that are relatively transparent to electrons while preventing evaporation of the liquid. A paper has argued that using this liquid-phase approach, higher resolution (3.2 Å) can be achieved than using cryo-EM (3.4 Å) when imaging and reconstructing adeno-associated virus particles. I show here that these assertions are untrue, and that basic principles in mathematics and physics would need to be violated to achieve the stated resolution in the liquid state.

Here, a total of 328 s-year Chinese students majoring in mathematics completed the Academic Motivation Scale (AMS) survey before and after the intervention involving an array of research-related assignments. Learners in the autonomy-supportive group showed a lower level of amotivation and higher intrinsic motivation compared to the pretest; the differences were 2.62 and 11.95 points. Their level of extrinsic motivation remained unchanged. The controlling intervention had the opposite effect, causing the mean extrinsic motivation score to increase by 10.25 points. The hybrid approach showed significant improvement in all three scales: amotivation (−3.82 points), extrinsic motivation (+4.35 points), and intrinsic motivation (+7.13 points). The autonomy-supportive teaching style corresponds to lower scores in mathematical modeling (72.30), linear algebra (74.62), and numerical analysis (77.65). High standard deviations indicate that research activity scores are spread out over a wide range. The controlling instructional approach yielded higher scores (83.95, 81.68, and 81.88 points, respectively) with the smallest standard deviations. Learners in the hybrid group scored the highest (86.98, 82.30, and 82.90 points, respectively), with moderate standard deviations indicating a well-balanced performance. The findings indicate that a hybrid approach, which combines autonomy support with instructor control, is the most effective in enhancing both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation among students, as well as improving their academic performance. The implications for higher education policy include the necessity of developing and implementing hybrid learning models that cater to the individual needs of students while providing the requisite level of support and oversight. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Consequently, they display an initial condition dependent dynamics, extreme multistability (coexistence of infinitely many attractors) and bifurcations without parameters. Recently, a new discretization scheme has been introduced for CT memristor circuits, guaranteeing that the first integrals are preserved exactly in the discretization. On this basis, FCAM has been extended to discrete-time (DT) memristor circuits showing that they also are characterized by invariant manifolds and they display extreme multistability and bifurcations without parameters. This manuscript considers the maps obtained via DT-FCAM for a circuit with a flux-controlled memristor and a capacitor and it provides a thorough and rigorous investigation of the presence of chaotic dynamics. In particular, parameter ranges are obtained where the maps have snap-back repellers at some fixed points, thus implying that they display chaos in the Marotto and also in the Li–Yorke sense. Bifurcation diagrams are provided where it is possible to analytically identify relevant points in correspondence with the appearance of snap-back repellers and the onset of chaos. The dependence of the bifurcation diagrams and snap-back repellers upon the circuit initial conditions and the related manifold is also studied. © The Author(s) 2024."

However, managing water resources faces challenges due to the involvement of multiple stakeholders and uncertainties in various hydrologic fluxes. This complexity makes it rare for research to simultaneously address the hidden uncertainties in both objectives and constraints. Here, we developed a scenario-based multi-objective fuzzy-credibility constrained programming approach and applied it to the water resource management system (SMOFCP-WRMS) of the Zhaokou Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Area Phase II Project (ZKID-II). This method handles uncertainties represented by scenarios and fuzzy sets, while also resolving fuzzy uncertainty parameters within the multiple objectives and constraints of the model. We solve the SMOFCP-RWMS model by integrating the Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) and compromise programming (CP) method. The results show that: (1) An increase in constraints violation risks (credibility level from 0.5 to 1.0) results in a decrease in water resources allocation and pollutant discharge by 25.95 × 106 m3 and 207.63 tonne, respectively, accompanied by a decline in net economic income by 68.04 × 106 CNY; (2) From extraordinary dry year to normal year (design frequencies from 95 % to 50 %) leads to a reduction in water shortage by 167.07 × 106 m3. Incorporating ‘credibility levels’ and ‘design frequencies’ would be beneficial for addressing uncertainties, including fuzzy information and discrete possibilities for the future; (3) Regarding the multi-objective model solution, the combined NSGA-III and CP approach demonstrates an average increase of 1.71 % in net economic benefits and 4.03 % in total pollution discharge, along with a 5.91 % reduction in the water deficit ration compared to the traditional CP method. Although the ecological benefits decrease slightly in the compromise-optimal solutions using the combined NSGA-III and CP method, the economic and social benefits are improved compared to those from the combined NSGA-II and CP method. This study provides valuable decision-making guidance for water resources managers in irrigated areas, aiding them in balancing economic, social, and ecological benefits, and enabling the section of an optimal water resources management scheme based on acceptable risk levels under various uncertain conditions. © 2024"

Firstly, a T–S fuzzy switched system model is proposed to depict the nonlinear UMVs with mass switching. Then, a dynamic event-triggered program with a memory function is introduced, which can not only save the communication resources of the nonlinear mass-switched UMVs (NMSUMVs) but also provide more flexibility to adjust the triggered thresholds than the usual event-triggered programs. Further, by using the multiple Lyapunov functions technique, DP of the NMSUMVs is achieved with communication transmission resource saving.

Although the concept of RL seems to be a part of GL, it is not correct to consider all activities carried out within RL within the scope of GL and it is important to integrate these two concepts. To support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), these two concepts are discussed in an integrated manner in this study. The main objectives of this study are to find barriers in the RL and GL concepts, to cluster barriers, and to present solution strategies. In this study, 21 barriers to GL and 28 barriers to RL are determined by a detailed literature review under the categories of Management & Organizational, Economic & Financial, Social, Technology & Infrastructure, Environment, and Legal. GL and RL barriers are clustered and 17 solution strategies are presented within the scope of Green Reverse Logistics (GRL) with the support of a literature review and expert opinion. Developed solution strategies are examined by the Fuzzy DEMATEL, FUCOM, and SWARA methods. The solution strategies are assessed, and their impact levels are ranked through the applied methods. As a result of the study, it is seen that the strategies that affect all strategies the most are “Provision of financial, administrative, and infrastructure support” and “Increase of public awareness on environmental”. In the results of the research, it is determined that the four most effective solution strategies are “Increase of public awareness on environmental”, “Collaboration between functions & stakeholders”, “Provision of financial, administrative, and infrastructure support”, and “Benchmarking the practices”. Such a detailed study has not been found, and it is thought that the study will lead to the development of a sustainable understanding in terms of both addressing GRL problems together and developing solution strategies. Implementing the strategies in the order determined as a result of the study will support the effective removal of barriers to GRL. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Understanding the circumstances under which they occur is crucial due to their potentially devastating impact. In contrast to prior studies that employed the jerk system to demonstrate chaotic behavior, hidden dynamics, and multistability, our investigation focuses on a complex quadratic jerk system to illustrate the emergence of extreme events. Our primary focus lies in discerning various bursting patterns such as periodic, quasi-periodic, strange nonchaotic, and chaotic with respect to the control parameter. Significantly, the transitions between these bursting dynamics are analyzed through bifurcation analysis and their corresponding Lyapunov exponents. Notably, the bifurcation analysis confirms the presence of extreme events by revealing a notable amplification in the signals maximum amplitude, which exceeds the extreme events critical threshold. Furthermore, we employ a two-parameter analysis to delineate regions corresponding to different bursting states, along with regions indicative of extreme events and non-extreme events phenomena. Interestingly, our observations pinpoint occurrences of extreme events within the nonchaotic domain. Consequently, we employ various statistical measures to confirm the presence of strange nonchaotic dynamics. Our results highlight the presence of extreme events in nonchaotic bursting in chaotic complex systems and provide insight into the complex interactions among dynamics in these systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The internal located bifurcation parameters including position in CI-DL-MHCS and length have been investigated in the work with the coolant velocities in the range of 0.25–1.05 m/s. The calculated models in simulation is set as symmetric boundary condition, while the assumptions including RNG k-ε turbulence flow and incompressibility dominate in the paper. Bifurcation located lower deck of CI-DL-MHCS has been shown to be effective in controlling the substrate temperature, with a reduction in peak temperature of >18 K compared to referenced CI-DL-MHCS. Numerical simulations clearly demonstrate the enhancement of heat transfer caused by impingement jets and novel located bifurcations with experimental verification. Besides, CI-DL-MHCS with bifurcation have an average Nusselt number enhancement by 4.47% higher compared with CI-DL-MHCS without bifurcation. The bifurcation inevitably occupies the space in CI-DL-MHCS, resulting in a higher pressure drop penalty than the proposed bifurcated structure CI-DL-MHCS, but this can be balanced by an increase in heat transfer considering the overall thermal performance factor. Thus, CI-DL-MHCS featured with bifurcation located in CI-DL-MHCS-LB_3 outperforms significantly in overall thermal performance and thermal uniformity on substrate among all the designed tested models. © 2024"

Employing a difference-in-differences methodology and focusing on within-student changes in academic performance between the pre- and early stages of the pandemic, we uncover robust evidence that the stringency of the zero-COVID policy is associated with significantly better mathematics performance for boys, while having no effects on girls. Mechanism analyses show that parental discipline is crucial for children's academic performance during COVID-19. Boys benefit more from parental discipline than girls, especially those with weaker noncognitive skills.

Interestingly, in-plane loading under simple tension has been the predominant actuation-of-choice, with other fundamental loadings (e.g., shear, torsion) being largely overlooked. In this work, we explore the instability landscape of a simple Kirigami motif under in-plane shear loading and demonstrate how the incorporation of shear actuation effectively augments both the design and output space of Kirigami-based metamaterials. The nonlinear response of Kirigami under shear is first elucidated parametrically via nonlinear Finite Element Analysis on a subset of geometrically asymmetric motifs. The interplay between cut layout and the bidirectional nature of in-plane shear enables a variegated bifurcation landscape that includes unusual inversions and sharp kinks in the bifurcation curves. The numerical analysis is complemented with experimental validation of the out-of-plane bifurcation curves of several cases of interest by means of shadow moiré and laser displacement sensing. Together with the experimental validation, a proof-of-concept demonstration of the applicability of Kirigami-shear metamaterials as multistate electro-mechanical switches is presented.

The considered model is solved using the RK method to compute the supernonlinear and nonlinear wave solutions. All phase portraits and wave solutions are depicted in the phase plane by simply fixing the relevant parameters values. The equilibrium points are obtained, and the same are classified. Moreover, sensitive analysis for different initial value problems is applied to analyze the quasiperiodic, chaotic behavior and time series after introducing an extrinsic periodic perturbation term.

Signalized intersections are a major safety concern for VRUs due to their complex dynamics, emphasizing the need to understand how these road users interact with motor vehicles and deploy evidence-based safety countermeasures. Given the infrequency of VRU-related crashes, identifying conflicts between VRUs and motorized vehicles as surrogate safety indicators offers an alternative approach. Automatically detecting these conflicts using a video-based system is a crucial step in developing smart infrastructure to enhance VRU safety. However, further research is required to enhance its reliability and accuracy. Building upon a study conducted by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT), which utilized a video-based event monitoring system to assess VRU and motor vehicle interactions at fifteen signalized intersections in Pennsylvania, this research aims to evaluate the reliability of automatically generated surrogates in predicting confirmed conflicts without human supervision, employing advanced data-driven models such as logistic regression and tree-based algorithms. The surrogate data used for this analysis includes automatically collectable variables such as vehicular and VRU speeds, movements, post-encroachment time, in addition to manually collected variables like signal states, lighting, and weather conditions. To address data scarcity challenges, synthetic data augmentation techniques are used to balance the dataset and enhance model robustness. The findings highlight the varying importance and impact of specific surrogates in predicting true conflicts, with some surrogates proving more informative than others. Additionally, the research examines the distinctions between significant variables in identifying bicycle and pedestrian conflicts. These findings can assist transportation agencies to collect the right types of data to help prioritize infrastructure investments, such as bike lanes and crosswalks, and evaluate their effectiveness. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Fraction difficulties limit not only students’ educational and vocational opportunities but also their ability to solve everyday problems. Students who exit sixth grade with inadequate understanding of fractions may experience far-reaching repercussions that lead to lifelong avoidance of mathematics. This article presents the results of a randomized controlled trial focusing on the first two cohorts of a larger efficacy investigation aimed at building fraction sense in students with mathematics difficulties. Teachers implemented an evidence-informed fraction sense intervention (FSI) within their sixth-grade intervention classrooms. The lessons draw from research in cognitive science as well as mathematics education research. Employing random assignment at the classroom level, multilevel modeling revealed a significant effect of the intervention on posttest fractions scores after controlling for pretest fractions scores, working memory, vocabulary, proportional reasoning, and classroom attentive behavior. Students in the FSI group outperformed their counterparts in the control group, with noteworthy effect sizes on most fraction measures.

However, this poses a privacy concern as attackers can deduce personal information from the raw location data. In this paper, we propose a framework to collect user location data while ensuring local differential privacy (LDP) in the last-mile delivery system of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) within an edge computing environment. Firstly, we obtain the user location distribution Quad-tree by employing a region partitioning method based on Quad-tree retrieval in the specified data collection area. Next, the user location matrix is retrieved from the obtained Quad-tree, and we perturb the user location data using an LDP perturbation scheme on the location matrix. Finally, the collected data is aggregated using blockchain to evaluate the utility of the dataset from various regions. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness of our framework in a real-world scenario, we conduct extensive simulations using datasets from multiple cities with varying urban densities and mobility patterns. These simulations not only demonstrate the scalability of our approach but also showcase its adaptability to different urban environments and delivery demands. Finally, our research opens new avenues for future work, including the exploration of more sophisticated LDP mechanisms that can offer higher levels of privacy without significantly compromising the quality of service. Additionally, the integration of emerging technologies such as 5G and beyond in the edge computing environment could further enhance the efficiency and reliability of UAV-based delivery systems, while also offering new challenges and opportunities for privacy-preserving data collection and analysis. © 2024 The Author(s)"

The inerter produces a fictitious mass amplification effect to improve the controller performance and the fractional order takes into account the previous state of the viscoelastic material. After formulating the dynamics equation using beam theory, the amplitude response is determined analytically using the averaging method. The results obtained from the analytical study are validated using the direct numerical simulation method (Newton–Leipnik method). By comparing the isolation performance of the FQZS (fractional quasi-zero stiffness) isolator and the IFQZS (inerter fractional quasi-zero stiffness) isolator, it is shown that the addition of inertance can significantly suppress the tendency of the curve to slope to the right, allowing us to have a wider isolation frequency range on force transmissibility while improving the efficiency of the isolator. One also shows that increasing the fractional parameter contributes to a decrease in the vibration amplitude of the structure, the amplitude of the force transmitted and the area in which unstable solutions appear. However, beyond a certain value of the fractional parameter, we observe an increase in the latter. In order to further extend the study, bifurcation diagram, phase portrait, time history and power spectral density are explored. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Unfortunately, there are many cases adding or averaging the nonlinear normalized citation counts of individual papers that can be found in the academic literature, indicating that nonlinear field normalization methods have long been misused in academia. In this paper, we performed the following three research works. First, we analyzed why the nonlinear normalized citation counts of individual papers should not be added or averaged from the perspective of theoretical analysis in mathematics: we provided mathematical proofs for the crucial steps of the analysis. Second, we systematically classified the existing main field normalization methods into linear and nonlinear field normalization methods. Third, we used real citation data to explore the error effects caused by adding or averaging the nonlinear normalized citation counts on practical research evaluation results. The above three research works provide a theoretical basis for the proper use of field normalization methods in the future.

Traditional TSP models primarily focus on minimizing the total travel distance or cost without considering the reliability of each route. In real-world situations, especially in logistics and network design, it's just as important to have reliable routes. A reliable route means there's a good chance it will be completed successfully and on time. Our research extends the conventional STSP framework by incorporating a reliability metric for each route, alongside the standard travel time metric. A tri-objective optimization model is proposed to minimize the mean and standard deviation of travel time and maximize route reliability simultaneously. A new algorithm called Permutation Binary-Addition-Tree (BAT) is proposed to solve the problem more efficiently when there is uncertainty. Our approach marks a significant step towards more realistic and practical solutions for route optimization problems in dynamic and uncertain environments. We also present a complexity analysis of our model against traditional cost-only TSP solutions, demonstrating the efficacy of considering reliability in route planning. © 2024"

Analyses of extant SR and SM data were conducted to inform conditions for simulations to determine the number of assessments required to yield sufficient sensitivity (i.e., probability of recommending an instructional change when a change was warranted) and specificity (i.e., probability of recommending maintaining an intervention when a change was not warranted) when comparing performance to goal lines based upon a future target score (i.e., benchmark) as well as normative comparisons (50th and 75th percentiles).

This study examines biogas production in different urban scales, assessing its correlation with key indicators. Notably, a consistent pattern of moderate energy generation throughout the year emerges, regardless of city size. This uniformity underscores the potential for optimizing waste-to-energy conversion and highlights the role of effective waste management in pollution mitigation. Furthermore, a direct correlation between city size and generated biogas underscores the potential of larger urban areas to utilize substantial waste volumes as an energy source. Consistency in waste levels across diverse contexts further emphasizes the positive environmental impact of this approach. Conversion efficiency exhibits predominant uniformity, indicating consistent energy recovery strategies across various cities. The direct link between operational stability and conversion efficiency highlights its role in optimizing biogas production. This holistic approach underscores the urgency of adaptive strategies and sustainable practices for a cleaner environment and enhanced energy efficiency. Future research can explore the economic implications of energy recovery strategies and delve into their long-term social and cultural viability. Addressing climate change and environmental regulations is crucial for shaping waste management decisions.

Our results characterize the influence of key parameters on different treatment responses and illustrate the response regions through bifurcation diagrams using parameters tuned by therapy. In particular, we examine a periodic outcome with a delayed therapy response followed by a cancer relapse. The repetitive pattern in this periodic solution is formed by two quasi-steady cancer states connected by two fast transitions. Our results suggest that the transient behavior of the delayed response, which is the fast transition after the cancer progression state, is induced by a periodic solution exhibiting an exploding period near a saddle–node bifurcation.

The composites of periodic microstructure are subjected to compressive loading and are undergoing large deformations. The perturbation expansion applied on the imperfect composites results in a zero and first order problems of perfect composites. In the former problem, loading exists and interfacial and periodicity conditions are imposed. In the latter one, however, loading is absent, the interfacial conditions possess complicated terms that have been already established by the zero order problem, and Bloch-Floquet boundary conditions are imposed. Both problems are solved by the high-fidelity generalized method of cells (HFGMC) micromechanical analysis. The ideal critical bifurcation stress can be readily predicted from the asymptotic values of the form of waviness growth with applied loading. This form enables also the estimation of the actual critical stress. The occurrence of the corresponding critical deformation and time is obtained by generating the stress-deformation response of the composite. The offered approach is illustrated for the prediction of bifurcation buckling of viscoelastic bi-layered and polymer matrix composites as well as porous materials. Finally, bifurcation buckling stresses of unidirectional composites in which the matrix is represented by the quasi-linear viscoelasticity theory are predicted. This quasi-linear viscoelasticity model exhibits constant damping which is observed by the actual viscoelastic behavior of biological materials. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The seismic vulnerability model directly affects the development of the earthquake risk distribution in regional structures. This paper innovatively developed a bivariate intensity measurement method based on macroscopic and instrumental seismic intensities. An optimized instrument intensity calculation model was established considering the actual monitoring data of historical earthquakes in China. A hybrid seismic vulnerability quantification method based on empirical, expert judgement and analysis has been proposed and applied to evaluate the vulnerability levels of three types of building clusters in two typical earthquakes in Qinghai Province, China (the 2008 Dachaidan (DCD) earthquake and the 2009 Haixi (HX) earthquake). A structural hybrid vulnerability matrix and surface for nine zones based on bivariate intensity measures were developed. A synthetic vulnerability membership index considering fuzzy failure criteria and decision theory was proposed, and vulnerability membership curves for different vulnerability levels were established. An improved earthquake economic loss prediction function is proposed, and synthetic economic vulnerability index prediction models for three typical buildings in different regions are established. The estimated and calculated results of the developed multiscale variable parameter synthetic vulnerability model are highly consistent with the actual earthquake loss observations. © 2024"

To predict the pathogenic factors of cardiogenic cerebral infarction, this paper proposes a machine learning based analytical prediction model. 494 patients with CCI who were hospitalized for the first time were consecutively included in the study between January 2017 and December 2021, and followed up every three months for one year after hospital discharge. Clinical, laboratory and imaging data were collected, and predictors associated with relapse and death in CCI patients at six months and one year after discharge were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods, meanwhile established a new machine learning model based on the enhanced moth-flame optimization (FTSAMFO) and the fuzzy K-nearest neighbor (FKNN), called BITSAMFO-FKNN, which is practiced on the dataset related to patients with CCI. Specifically, this paper proposes the spatial transformation strategy to increase the exploitation capability of moth-flame optimization (MFO) and combines it with the tree seed algorithm (TSA) to increase the search capability of MFO. In the benchmark function experiments FTSAMFO beat 5 classical algorithms and 5 recent variants. In the feature selection experiment, ten times ten-fold cross-validation trials showed that the BITSAMFO-FKNN model proved actual medical importance and efficacy, with an accuracy value of 96.61%, sensitivity value of 0.8947, MCC value of 0.9231, and F-Measure of 0.9444. The results of the trial showed that hemorrhagic conversion and lower LVDD/LVSD were independent risk factors for recurrence and death in patients with CCI.

We quantify the maximal delay by constructing a piecewise linear (PWL) transcritical minimal model and studying the dynamics near the slow-manifolds. Our findings encompass all potential maximum delay behaviours within the range of parameters, allowing us to identify: (i) the trivial scenario where the maximal delay tends to zero with the singular parameter; (ii) the singular scenario where zd(λ,ɛ) is not bounded, and also (iii) the transitional scenario where the maximal delay tends to a positive finite value as the singular parameter goes to zero. Moreover, building upon the concepts by Vidal and Françoise (2012), we construct a PWL system combining symmetrically two transcritical minimal models in such a way it shows periodic behaviour. As the parameter λ changes, the system presents a non-bounded canard explosion leading to an enhanced delay phenomenon at the critical value. Our understanding of the maximal delay zd(λ,ɛ) of a single normal form, allows us to determine both, the amplitude of the canard cycles and, in the enhanced delay case, the increase of the amplitude for each passage. © 2024"

Existing models based on traditional fuzzy sets and specific norms cannot describe complex issues such as selecting the best electric power system (EPS). These decision models can also be challenging, especially when transparency and regulatory compliance are required. This study introduces a novel operational framework based on Hamacher aggregation operators for q-rung orthopair fuzzy set soft sets. It aims to help decision-makers identify appropriate policies to overcome the shortfall of electric power. The advantages of the introduced decision support tool are better discrimination ability, well suited for handling extreme values in data, greater flexibility in representing complex DM scenarios, and parametrization. We also demonstrate the practical application of our approach to a real-world problem related to selecting the most suitable EPS in Pakistan. The selection is made from the set of five EPSs and is based on critical aspects like social acceptance, environmental impact, and cost-effectiveness. The findings show that the developed approach effectively identifies the best EPS. Tuning variables like q and ℓ allows for testing the sensitivity of the developed operators. The results showed that higher values of q make the uncertainty more evenly represented, which is essential for specific uses.

The results prove the efficacy of the proposed method in enhancing the accuracy of routed outflow, aligning well with the inherent characteristics of a flooding event. Validation of the newly introduced fuzzified nonlinear variable-parameter Muskingum model was conducted using four distinct case studies from the literature, including Wilson's data, the flood events in Rivers Wye and Wyre, and Viessman and Lewis' data. The evaluation of the proposed framework's effectiveness utilized the Sum of Squared Deviations (SSQ) as the objective function of the model, along with six different supplemental metrics.

The research specifically focuses on factors such as the age of students at the beginning of schooling, attendance at preschool institutions, and their mathematical skills before starting school. Through the application of SPSS analysis, insights into the statistical relationships and trends between these factors are provided, emphasizing the importance of early educational experiences to improve the quality of education in Bosnia & Herzegovina.

Aims: In this paper we address the following questions: What markers of positive affect are observed while students are doing early algebra? Specifically, how are students’ markers of joy related to early algebraic practices? What are the characteristics of playful stances to learning early algebra that are observed when children express positive epistemic affect? Sample: We analyze three cases in which elementary school students engaged in tasks from an early algebra classroom teaching experiment. Methods: Drawing from two theoretical frameworks, epistemic affect and early algebra, we conducted microgenetic analyses of lesson transcripts to identify markers of joy and early algebraic practices. We conducted frequency analyses to determine their co-occurrence. Results: Our results indicate that children expressed joy while engaging in early algebraic practices, evidence of positive epistemic affect. We describe the aspects of each of the cases we present in terms of prior literature on playful stances to learning to further bolster our claims about the relationship between joy and engagement with the early algebraic practices. Conclusions: We conclude that mathematical learning environments should include open opportunities for students to engage with mathematical content, with multiple entry points and ways to respond. We also conclude that early algebraic practices provide opportunities for playfully engagement and positive epistemic affect. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

One interesting question may arise: do similar flame bifurcations exist in NH3/H2 mixtures? To answer this, this study employs the premixed counterflow configuration and examines the potential bifurcations of the NH3/H2/air flame with one-dimensional simulations. For the first time, a novel weak combustion mode of NH3/H2 mixtures is observed and termed as the weak flame in the following. Unlike the conventional hot flame, the weak flame exhibits significantly lower flame temperatures (1300–1500 K) and a mere 1 % of the heat release rate (∼109 J/m3/s) associated with hot flames. Within the weak flame, H2 is entirely oxidized to H2O, whereas only a portion of NH3 is partially oxidized, resulting in the formation of H2O, N2, N2O, and NO. Further reaction path analyses reveal that the NH3 (+OH) → NH2 (+NO2) → H2NO (+NH2, +HO2, +O2, +NO2) → HNO (+O2) → NO (+HO2) → NO2 → N2O pathway is the primary oxidation route of ammonia in the weak flame. Furthermore, the effects of pressure, hydrogen content, and equivalence ratio are systematically assessed to explore the operation conditions of the ammonia/hydrogen weak flame. The study reveals that the weak flame is promoted at elevated pressures, and exists with a moderate hydrogen addition, i.e., xH2 = 0.02–0.4. A regime diagram is further proposed to summarize the combined influences of hydrogen molar fraction and equivalence ratio. In the end, the impacts of chemical mechanisms are tested and the dominant ammonia oxidization path in the weak flame persists for models capable of predicting weak flames. © 2024 The Combustion Institute"

The authors analyzed 125 publications published between 1975 and 2023 to identify different research methods and teaching solutions that utilize photography. Within educational research two main approaches that are often used combined were photo-elicitation (photographs are used in an interview as a stimulus) and photovoice (taking photographs is a way the participant communicates their perspective). Mathematics education research could also combine these methods, for example in identity research. Our findings regarding teaching show that photographs have an important role in connecting mathematics to the real world and for visualizing mathematics. The best way to engage students is when they take photographs of themselves as a starting point to mathematical activity.

Hence, it is important to understand how teachers can prevent disengagement and underachievement in high-ability students. Whereas a large body of research has demonstrated that need-supportive teaching (i.e., the provision of autonomy support, involvement, and structure) and differentiated instruction relate positively to students' academic development, it remains unclear whether such practices would be equally, more, or less beneficial for high-ability students. Drawing on data from a longitudinal four-wave study among early adolescents from Flanders (N = 3586), this study showed that need-supportive teaching in math classes was positively associated with intrinsic motivation, behavioral engagement, and math performance in high-ability students, both at the level of between-student differences and at the level of changes in students over time. Standardized estimates were typically between 0.05 and 0.20 at the between-person level, indicating small effect sizes, with more modest effect sizes at the within-person level. Importantly, these associations were found to be generally equivalent across high- and average-ability students. Comparing the provision of need-supportive teaching to either high- or average-ability students, high-ability students particularly reported more autonomy support from their math teachers than average-ability students, with small effect sizes (i.e., Cohen's d between 0.16 and 0.27). These findings underline the importance of need-supportive teaching to support the motivational and academic development of both high- and average-ability students. © 2024 Society for the Study of School Psychology"

Using mathematical models, the nature of the spread of the Hepatitis B virus can be predicted. In the present paper, a hepatitis B epidemic model with a Beddington–DeAngelis type incidence rate and a constant vaccination rate is considered. Some dynamical properties of this model, such as non-negativity, boundedness character, the basic reproduction number R0, stability nature, and the bifurcation phenomenon, are investigated. By the Bendixson theorem, it is demonstrated that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. It is shown that a transcritical bifurcation phenomenon occurs when R0=1. It is concluded that the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when R0>1, by utilizing Dulac’s criteria. Also, a discrete system of difference equations is obtained by constructing a non-standard finite difference (NSFD) scheme for the continuous model. It is shown that the solutions of this discrete system are dynamically consistent for all finite step sizes. The theoretical results obtained are also supported and visualized by numerical simulations. These simulations also demonstrate that the NSFD scheme produces much more efficient results than the Euler or RK4 schemes, as shown in the theoretical results obtained. © The Author(s) 2024."

Three layers are designed in the new model: data evaluation layer, data storage layer and data distribution layer. The data evaluation layer extracts the features from medical data and evaluates their values based on the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) method. Then, in the data storage layer, according to the value of medical data, a novelty data structure called Merkle–Huffman tree (M-H tree) is established. Compared with the Merkle tree, high-value data (frequently accessed data) in M-H tree is saved closer to the root node and can be found faster. In the data distribution layer, the sharding-based blockchain model is adopted to increase the storage scalability of the IoMT system. Finally, the experimental results show that the new learning-based model can effectively improve the query speed of the blockchain-enabled medical system by about 3.5% and free up large amounts of storage space on IoMT devices. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Due to a progressive loss of protective antibodies there is waning immunity in the first infection stage and disease enhancement or protection effects by the second infection stage. Bifurcation analysis reveals two codim-2 bifurcations as organizing centers. The unfolding of a cusp bifurcation describes the transition of the disease-free equilibrium into an endemic equilibrium by varying a parameter. These equilibria allow an analytical solution with explicit expressions which allow for a full geometrical interpretation of the occurring bifurcations related to stationary dynamics. A Bogdanov-Takens point is the starting point in the parameter space where oscillatory endemic dynamics occurs including a homoclinic connection.

Unfortunately, in spite of its desirable structural properties, it turned out that tree-cut width falls short as an edge-cut based alternative to treewidth in algorithmic aspects. This has led to the very recent introduction of a simple edge-based parameter called edge-cut width [WG 2022], which has precisely the algorithmic applications one would expect from an analogue of treewidth for edge cuts, but does not have the desired structural properties. In this paper, we study a variant of tree-cut width obtained by changing the threshold for so-called thin nodes in tree-cut decompositions from 2 to 1. We show that this “slim tree-cut width” satisfies all the requirements of an edge-cut based analogue of treewidth, both structural and algorithmic, while being less restrictive than edge-cut width.

We elucidate, both experimentally and numerically, new aspects which deeply affect the dynamics when the classical assumptions of adiabatic or conducting walls cease to be valid.

Previous attempts, led by David Hilbert, to show that all of mathematics can be built into an axiomatic system that is complete and consistent failed when Kurt Gödel proved that there will always be statements which are known to be true but can never be proven within the same axiomatic system. But Gödel and his followers took no account of brain mechanisms that generate and mediate logic. In this largely theoretical paper, but backed by previous experiments and our new ones reported below, we show that in the case of so-called ‘optical illusions’, there exists a significant and irreconcilable difference between their visual perception and their description according to Euclidean geometry; when participants are asked to adjust, from an initial randomised state, the perceptual geometric axioms to conform to the Euclidean description, the two never match, although the degree of mismatch varies between individuals. These results provide evidence that perceptual axioms, or statements known to be perceptually true, cannot be described mathematically. Thus, the logic of the visual perceptual system is irreconcilable with the cognitive (mathematical) system and cannot be updated even when knowledge of the difference between the two is available. Hence, no one brain reality is more ‘objective’ than any other. © 2024 The Author(s).

For the deterministic component of this model, we delve into an extensive examination of the local asymptotic stability of its positive equilibrium state. Subsequently, for the stochastic model, we derive critical conditions that determine the thresholds for exponential extinction and persistence of both predator and prey populations. Importantly, our findings not only encompass scenarios where there are no stochastic disturbances but also shed light on how environmental noise impacts the population dynamics within the predator–prey system. Through the exploration of the homologous Fokker–Planck equations, we present approximate representations characterizing the probability density function of the stochastic predator–prey model. To substantiate these theoretical advancements, several illustrative examples are provided, offering numerical elucidations of our proposed results and emphasizing the profound effects of stochastic noises and some important parameters on the behaviors of the stochastic model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The survey method was used to collect and analyze quantitative data, while interviews and documentation methods were used for qualitative non-numerical data. The respondents consisted of elementary school teachers in Makassar who were selected using simple random sampling. The results showed that using SWOT analysis and internal strategic factors analysis summary-external strategic factors analysis summary (IFAS-EFAS) calculations, the strengths-opportunities (SO) strategy has the highest score of 4.27. In addition, the weaknesses-opportunities (WO), strengths-threats (ST), and weaknesses-threats (WT) strategies received consecutive scores of 3.25, 2.71, and 1.69, respectively. It suggests that STEAM learning in Makassar is in a growth stage due to its strengths and opportunities that support the development of STEAM education in the city. © 2024, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

Creating an appropriate classroom climate based on every student's ability is crucial to overcoming the prejudices associated with mathematics. In this regard, this study aims to create the best classroom climate approach that will increase interest in mathematics and ensure academic success. For this purpose, mathematicians' views on the classroom climate approach and how they create them were discussed by using qualitative techniques. It was considered that teachers participating in this research are working in 9th grade in state high schools affiliated with the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus Ministry of Education, accepting students through examination. The researchers collected teacher views through a semistructured interview form and analyzed them using context analysis. The findings showed that teachers were in a hurry to teach and generally paid attention to creating a comfortable classroom climate in which students could express their thoughts and opinions. This situation also revealed a lack of adequate classroom climate approach skills among teachers. Therefore, the classroom climate approaches discussed in this study are expected to make a significant contribution to this field by offering solutions to teachers in creating a supportive classroom climate. © 2024, J.

In this study, the impacting contact is modeled as a trilinear repulsive force. Based on the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory, the nonlinear governing equations, which take into account geometric, curvature, and damping nonlinearities, are developed using Hamilton's principle. The continuous model is discretized using the Galerkin method and then solved using the arc-length technique and a time integration method. A linear analysis of the natural frequency and complex mode shape shows the unexpected frequency intersection and modal asymmetry. The qualitative changes in the nonlinear dynamics of the impacting pipe in both sub- and super-critical regions are examined and presented in the form of bifurcation diagrams, frequency–amplitude curves, force–amplitude curves, time histories, and phase portraits. Numerical results show that some complex dynamical behaviors can occur in different impact constraint cases, including a grazing bifurcation, sticking, period doubling, and chaos at the impact location, may occur. The initial curvature and gravity result in different behaviors, such as the asymmetry change of the equilibrium configuration and the occurrence of the flutter instability. The current analysis is significant to understand the non-smooth dynamic mechanisms and also provide design and technology guidance for the pipe system with motion-limiting constraints. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Firstly, a constrained Rapidly-exploring Random Tree-Connect algorithm (C-RRT-Connect) is proposed as the basic algorithm of reactive trajectory planning to globally plan for avoiding static obstacles in the environment. The C-RRT-Connect algorithm introduces the idea of target attraction to constrain the optimal growth point in the RRT-Connect algorithm. Then, based on the global trajectory, the local optimization is carried out according to the dynamic threats detected by the UAV during the flight. According to the real-time relative state between the UAV and the detected dynamic threat, the reaction sampling points and directional coefficients for avoiding the corresponding dynamic threat are generated online via the action network trained with the depth deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DDPG). And then the local trajectory is adjusted to modify the flight trajectory of the UAV to achieve reactive obstacle avoidance. The simulation experiment firstly compares the global trajectory planning performance of C-RRT-Connect and RRT-Connect in static environment, and secondly compares the local trajectory planning performance of DDPG algorithm and the artificial potential field method in dynamic environment. The experimental results show that in static environment, C-RRT-Connect algorithm has faster searching speed, less invalid samples and higher searching trajectory quality than RRT-Connect algorithm; In a dynamic environment, DDPG algorithm reduces the average running time by about 26% compared with the artificial potential field method, and has a stronger ability to evade dynamic threats in real time. © IMechE 2024."

Beside the classes of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals of a common SIRS model, here we define three new classes related to the information spreading model, e.g. unaware individuals, misinformed individuals and individuals who are skeptical to disease-related misinformation. Under our assumptions, the system evolves on two time scales. We completely characterize its asymptotic behavior with techniques of Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT). We exploit the time scale separation to analyze two lower dimensional subsystem separately. First, we focus on the analysis of the fast dynamics and we find three equilibrium point which are feasible and stable under specific conditions. We perform a theoretical bifurcation analysis of the fast system to understand the relations between these three equilibria when varying specific parameters of the fast system. Secondly, we focus on the evolution of the slow variables and we identify three branches of the critical manifold, which are described by the three equilibria of the fast system. We fully characterize the slow dynamics on each branch. Moreover, we show how the inclusion of (mis)information spread may negatively or positively affect the evolution of the epidemic, depending on whether the slow dynamics evolves on the second branch of the critical manifold, related to the skeptical-free equilibrium or on the third one, related to misinformed-free equilibrium, respectively.

We decided to split the samples randomly in two by designating a random half as exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and the other half as confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). EFA was used to confirm a robust “four-dimensional, nine-factor” measurement structure, encompassing four key dimensions, namely mathematical critical thinking, mathematical creative thinking, mathematical problem-solving, and mathematical metacognitive skills. The scale's quality was assessed through a retest using CFA and the structural validity was evaluated through CFA and correlation analysis. The criterion validity of the scale was also examined using math scores. The results from the double validity analysis showed that the scale had a reasonable and valid structure.

Existing neural network models learn a semantic representation for each argument from its compositional words and classify discourse relation by the interactive semantic representation of an argument pair. As the basic English unit, a word only carries a simple and limited meaning that may be incorrectly interpreted in an argument without considering its syntactic context. This motivates us to explore whether we can learn an argument’s semantic representation from another language unit phrase which usually contains full contextual meaning. We also argue that some semantic connection in between phrase pairs can be further exploited to infer the discourse relation between arguments. In this paper, we propose an Attentive Phrase Interaction Learning (APIL) model to parse and encode the interactive phrase structure for the IDRR task. In APIL, we propose a minimum subtree algorithm to obtain the phrase sequence of input arguments from its constituency syntax tree. We also design an Attentive Matching Network to learn the representation for each phrase from both arguments’ semantic context and words’ linguistic evidence. Furthermore, we propose a Phrase Inference Network to encode the linguistic relations of phrase pairs as semantic connections for relation inference.

Scientific evidence on this matter is scarce due to the limited number of systematic intervention studies. Accordingly, we conducted an intervention study in which first-graders (Mage = 6.48 years, SD = 0.35) completed a finger-based training (18 sessions of ∼ 30 min each) over the course of the first school year. The training was integrated into standard mathematics instruction in schools and compared with business-as-usual curriculum teaching. At the end of first grade and in a follow-up test 9 months later in second grade, children who received the finger training (n = 119) outperformed the control group (n = 123) in written addition and subtraction. No group differences were observed for number line estimation tasks. These results suggest that finger-based numerical strategies can enhance arithmetic learning, supporting the idea of an embodied representation of numbers, and challenge the prevailing skepticism about finger use in primary mathematics education. © 2024 The Author(s)"

To encounter the described problem, a new approach of combining the bifurcation analysis with the state feedback controller is proposed. A bifurcation analysis at different equilibrium points is performed to obtain the stable region of operation. In addition to this, the transients behavior of the system is also obtained simultaneously in the form of eigenvalues plots. The objective of the proposed controller is to generate a control law and state variables to reduce the transients keeping the system within the stability boundary by tuning the reference input matrix. From the obtained simulation results, it is seen that, by combining the bifurcation analysis with state feedback controller, the transients and the steady state error are reduced by selecting the purely negative real eigenvalues and reference input matrix respectively. The obtained closed loop control law and the state variables utilizing Ackerman's Formula are found within the stability limit. A sensitivity index obtained from local sensitivity analysis verifies the relationship between the stability boundary at different longitudinal velocity on a low-friction road obtained from bifurcation analysis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Thus, existing PM-oriented B+-trees mainly concentrate on alleviating the write overhead (i.e., reducing PM writes and flush instructions). Unfortunately, due to the improper data organization in the sorted leaf node, existing solutions cause massive data migration when data inserting or node splitting occurs. In this paper, we propose a write-optimized PM-oriented B+-tree with aligned flush and selective migration, called WPB+-tree, to solve the above problems. WPB+-tree first adopts a buffer-assisted mechanism that temporarily stores the newly inserted data to reduce the overhead of entry shifts. Second, WPB+-tree employs a selective migration of node entries scheme to achieve less than half of the data migration when a node is split. Moreover, existing PM-oriented B+-trees usually employ a coarse-grained lock to avoid thread conflicts, which can severely degrade the concurrency efficiency. Thus, we further propose a fine-grained lock technique for WPB+-tree, namely, parallel-efficient WPB+-tree (WOPE), to improve the concurrency efficiency. We implement the proposed WPB+-tree and WOPE on Linux and conduct extensive evaluations with actual persistent memory, where WOPE achieves 23.5%, 30.7%, and 15.3% of performance improvement (insert, read, and scan) over the straightforward solutions (i.e., SSB-Tree, Fast&Fair, and wB+tree), and 10.1% of performance improvement over WPB+-tree, on average. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Firstly, based on the established time-delayed governor model, the combined impact of these time delays on the stability of equilibrium is investigated, and the local bifurcation behaviors of equilibrium are analyzed via the method of multiple scales. Subsequently, the global correlation between system responses and parameter combinations is explored using a two-parameter co-simulation scheme, which incorporates a dimension reduction technique for the time-delayed system, the largest Lyapunov exponent, and the parallel computing technique. Furthermore, the bifurcation laws of various system responses and potential chaotic routes are studied through one-parameter bifurcation analyses. Considering the intricate operational environment and uncertain external disturbances, the steady-state response of the delayed governor system is further studied under a large number of initial conditions. To achieve this goal, a numerical strategy is proposed that incorporates a dimension reduction technique for the time-delayed system, the method of cell mapping, and the probability of convergence. Using this numerical strategy, the multi-stability behavior of the time-delayed governor system is thoroughly investigated, and the effectiveness of this numerical method is validated through the one-parameter bifurcation analysis. The revealed dynamic behavior would provide a deeper understanding of the time-delayed governor dynamics in both the parameter and state spaces. It is mentioned that the presented numerical strategies are also applicable in the design and motion control of other nonlinear dynamical systems with time delay effects, such as the time-delayed vibration absorbers and isolators. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Despite their versatility, WSNs grapple with challenges like limited energy reserves and constrained computational capacities, making energy conservation a paramount concern for IoT deployments underpinned by WSNs. This study introduces the Hybrid Routing Protocol for Efficient Energy (HRP-EE) designed to enhance the operational efficiency of WSNs. The HRP-EE protocol unfolds over three meticulous stages: the selection of cluster heads, the formation of clusters, and the establishment of routing pathways. Initially, the protocol evaluates nodes based on their residual energy and their Euclidean distance to the central sink (or gateway) device to designate apt cluster heads. Subsequently, these chosen cluster heads are integrated into the Voronoi diagram as central nodes to orchestrate cluster architectures. In the terminal stage, an innovative hybrid algorithm is instituted. This algorithm amalgamates the principles of the Minimum Spanning Tree for structuring intra-cluster communication trees and Dijkstra's algorithm to ascertain the most efficient paths for inter-cluster data transmission from cluster heads to the sink device. The primary objective of this protocol is the judicious utilization of the sensor nodes’ energy, thereby optimizing the overall network longevity. To assess the proficiency of HRP-EE, we executed a series of simulations using NS2. Comparative analyses reveal that HRP-EE outperforms existing protocols such as LEACH-VA, PEGCP, and TBC, delivering superior energy efficiency, extended network lifespan, and enhanced throughput across both homogeneous and heterogeneous network architectures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

(Cognition 114(2):293–297, 2010. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2009.09.013), math anxiety is related to deficits in numerical magnitude processing, which in turn compromises the development of advanced math skills. Because previous studies on this topic are contradictory, which may be due to methodological differences in the measurement of numerical magnitude processing, we tested Maloney et al.’s hypothesis using different tasks and their indicators: numerical magnitude processing (symbolic and non-symbolic comparison tasks: accuracy, reaction time, numerical ratio, distance and size effects, and Weber fraction; number line estimation task: estimation error), math anxiety (combined scores of learning, testing, math problem solving, and general math anxiety), and math performance. The results of our study conducted on 119 young adults mostly support the hypothesis proposed by Maloney et al. that deficiency in symbolic magnitude processing is related to math anxiety, but the relationship between non-symbolic processes and math anxiety was opposite to the assumptions. Moreover, the results indicate that estimation processes (but not comparison processes) and math anxiety are related to math performance in adults. Finally, high math anxiety moderated the relationship between reaction time in the symbolic comparison task, reaction time in the non-symbolic comparison task, numerical ratio effect in the symbolic comparison task, and math performance. Because the results of the joint effect of numerical magnitude processing and math anxiety on math performance were inconsistent, this part of the hypothesis is called into question. © The Author(s) 2024."

Few quantitative studies in the existing literature analyze the risk factors that affect and cause UAV accidents. Therefore, this study aims to reveal the dependency relationships among the risk factors associated with UAV accidents by using a data-driven tree-augmented naïve Bayesian network (TAN-BN) method. Firstly, UAV accident reports from transportation departments of various countries are collected and analyzed to establish a dataset on the risk factors inducing different UAV accidents. Then, a data-driven UAV risk analysis model is constructed through data learning and training approaches to reveal the interdependency of risk factors and their comprehensive impacts on the severity of UAV accidents. Sensitivity analysis is comprehensively conducted to show the rationality of the proposed TAN-BN. The results reveal that the risk factors “other aircraft”, “observer errors”, “non-powerplant”, “preconditions for unsafe acts”, “powerplant”, and “adverse weather” are the key factors resulting in UAV accidents. In addition, “observer errors”, “other aircraft”, “non-powerplant” and “adverse weather” are more likely to incur severe “accidents”. Some potential proactive plans and measures are proposed to help prevent the occurrence of UAV accidents. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Effects of prey-taxis are manifested from the obtained results. By using the prey-taxis coefficient as the bifurcation parameter, the occurrence conditions of the steady state bifurcation is established. It is found that there is no steady state bifurcation without prey-taxis or with the attractive type prey-taxis, meanwhile, the steady state bifurcation will occur when the repulsive type prey-taxis is present. In the sequel, by employing the Crandall–Rabinowitz local bifurcation theory, the existence of the bifurcating solution and its stability are further explored. It is stable if the second-order perturbation term is less than zero, and unstable if greater than zero. The resulting nonconstant steady states are displayed through numerical simulation, which are in agreement with theoretical analysis. No steady state bifurcation or patterns will appear in simulation when the prey-taxis is absent. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Current methods rely on heuristics, leading to time-consuming processes and inability to detect novel crawlers. Privacy protection and communication burdens during training are overlooked, resulting in potential privacy leaks. To address these issues, we propose a federated deep learning crawler detection model that analyzes access behaviors while preserving privacy. First, individual clients locally host website data, while the central server aggregates information for detection model parameters, eliminating raw user data transmission or access. We then develop an innovative algorithm constructing access path trees from user logs, effectively extracting temporal and spatial behavior features. Additionally, we propose a novel time series model with fused additive attention, enabling effective web crawler detection while preserving privacy and reducing data transmission.

The existing fault detection scheme based on the transient monitoring function (TMF) fails under such scenarios. A new decentralised machine learning (ML) based fault detection and classification scheme is proposed in this paper using terminal voltage information of IIDG (vo−abc). TMF of vo−abc, along with the zero sequence component of vo−abc, is utilised for training and testing of ensemble bagged trees ML algorithm. The proposed scheme is implemented inside each IIDG, and hence, it does not require communication. It is validated on a modified CIGRE test benchmark microgrid for all shunt faults at various locations with different loading, fault resistances, and inception angles. The accuracy of detection and classification of fault (DCF) during fault cases with unbalanced loads, noise, harmonic loads, and no-fault scenarios such as load and DG switching proves the effectiveness of the proposed method with varying scenarios. The performance of the proposed scheme is found to be superior when compared with the existing threshold based TMF and Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT) based techniques considering accuracy, dependability, security, and response time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The static equilibrium characteristics exhibit a Pitchfork bifurcation, wherein the control parameter is the rod density ratio. The investigation also encompasses the examination of the impact of the depth and diameter ratios on the nonlinear static behavior.

However, this property of multiplication is difficult for students to understand. We used two unique data sets to explore middle school students’ use of the distributive property. Study 1 involved data from 1:1 structured interviews of students (N = 24) discussing worked examples and solving associated practice problems. We examined whether or not students used the distributive property to solve the problems and whether or not interviewers followed the recommended distributive property prompts or defaulted to more conventional methods. Despite exposure to worked examples using the distributive property and a protocol calling for attention to it, students and interviewers favored methods like PEMDAS (parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction) or long multiplication. Study 2 used a data set with middle school students’ (N = 131) item-level responses on Kirkland's (2022; doctoral dissertation, University of Notre Dame) Brief Assessment of Mature Number Sense along with several related measures of domain-general and domain-specific skills. We extracted problems involving the distributive property for analysis. Surprisingly, there was no evidence that students’ use of the distributive property improved from sixth grade to eighth grade. However, both grade-level mathematics achievement and cognitive reflection uniquely predicted the correct use of the distributive property. Results suggest that middle school students who exhibit stronger reflective thinking tend to perform better on distributive property problems. Findings highlight cognitive reflection as a potentially important construct involved in the understanding and use of the distributive property. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

In these models, nonuniform steady states often represent stationary spatial patterns. Notably, these steady states are not unique, and unveiling them mathematically presents challenges. In this paper, we introduce a framework based on bifurcation theory to address pattern formation problems, specifically examining whether nonuniform steady states can bifurcate from trivial ones. Furthermore, we employ linear stability analysis to investigate the stability of the trivial steady-state solutions. We apply the method to two classic reaction–diffusion models: the Schnakenberg model and the Gray–Scott model. For both models, our approach effectively reveals many nonuniform steady states and assesses the stability of the trivial solution. Numerical computations are also presented to validate the solution structures for these models. © 2024"

High-speed schlieren video captured shock reflection and detonation onset through the sidewall of the shock tube, and simultaneously, self-luminous imaging through the end wall enabled the determination of the location of detonation onset in three-dimensional space. Tests were carried out with nitrogen- diluted stoichiometric ethylene-oxygen. Weak and strong detonation initiation modes were observed at the low and high end of the reflected shock temperature range tested, respectively. A novel reflected shock bifurcation driven weak detonation initiation mode was observed at intermediate temperatures where a flame, ignited at one, or multiple, reflecting wall corners, accelerated along the channel wall corner reaching the bifurcated reflected shock wave. The flame rapidly spread through the bifurcation stagnation bubble transitioning to detonation. The reflected shock temperature range that this new weak initiation mode was observed depends on the reflected shock pressure. For low reflected shock pressures, typical of historic detonation initiation shock reflection studies, this weak bifurcation mode was not observed. Nonreactive three-dimensional Navier-Stokes simulations showed that the reflected shock bifurcation generates flow conditions along the channel wall corners that can explain the observed flame propagation from the end wall to the stagnation bubble, and the subsequent rapid spreading in the stagnation bubble. © 2024 The Combustion Institute"

Despite the high utilization of the blockchain, its write-intensive feature causes a large amount of disk I/Os when trying to index and process queries over the data. Among previous studies, the hierarchical quadrant spatial LSM tree (i.e., HQ-sLSM tree) was proposed as an effective structure to index large amounts of geospatial point data from the blockchain and process queries while triggering a low number of disk I/Os. However, geospatial data exist in forms such as lines and polygons inside cadastral maps and survey information. In this paper, we propose an extended version of the HQ-sLSM tree which indexes geospatial line and polygon data. The extended tree, named the HQ-sLSM+ tree, inherits and adapts some common features and the low disk I/O algorithms of the original HQ-sLSM tree, fitting them to the line and polygon data types. Furthermore, an algorithm to process the spatial join query over two HQ-sLSM+ trees is proposed. A concept of a spatial join filter is introduced to access disk components efficiently. Experiments confirmed that the number of disk I/Os triggered when spatially joining two HQ-sLSM+ trees was much less compared to existing baseline index trees such as the R-tree and the LSM R-tree. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

The objective of this study is to identify and evaluate the risks associated with gully erosion in the Medjerda watershed in the northeastern part of Algeria. To accomplish this goal, two models were utilized: the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP) and the frequency ratio (FR). Twelve factors that contribute to soil erosion were considered in the study: slope, elevation, distance to streams, land use and land cover, drainage density (DD), topographic wetness index (TWI), rainfall, soil groups, lineament density, soil power index (SPI), sediment transport index (STI), and plan curvature. The results indicate that sediment transport index (STI), rainfall, and slope are the most influential factors in predicting erosion in the Medjerda Basin. To validate the models used, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was employed. The AUC values obtained for the FR and F-AHP models were 75.5 and 73.7%, respectively, indicating their excellent accuracy in identifying the erosion susceptibility area. The accuracy ratings of both models demonstrate their outstanding predictive capabilities. Thus, the results of soil erosion susceptibility maps with a better success rate and forecast could be beneficial and effective for implementing various policy measures to safeguard soil. They could be useful for managing gully erosion risks in different parts of the river basin. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2024.

Participants included 114 preschool children aged 3.12 to 5.26 years (M = 4.17 years, SD = 0.59). Specifically, this study examined whether mathematical language and three emergent literacy skills (print knowledge, phonological awareness, and general vocabulary) in the fall of preschool predicted 12 individual early numeracy skills in the spring, controlling for age, sex, rapid automatized naming, parent education, and autoregressors. Results indicated that mathematical language predicted development of most of the early numeracy skills (e.g., set comparison, numeral comparison, numeral identification), but findings for emergent literacy skills were not robust.

Fingers could have a special status during development because they operate as external support that provide sensory-motor and kinesthetic affordances in addition to visual input. However, it was unknown whether fingers are more helpful than manipulatives such as tokens during arithmetic problem solving. To address this question, we conducted a study with 93 Vietnamese children (48 girls) aged 4 and 5 years (mean = 58 months, range = 47–63) with high arithmetic and counting skills from families with relatively high socioeconomic status. Their behaviors were observed as they solved addition problems with manipulatives at their disposal. We found that children spontaneously used both manipulatives and fingers to solve the problems. Crucially, their performance was not higher when fingers rather than manipulatives were used (i.e., 70% vs. 81% correct answers, respectively). Therefore, at the beginning of learning, it is possible that, at least for children with high numerical skills, fingers are not the only gateway to efficient arithmetic development and manipulatives might also lead to proficient arithmetic. © 2024 The Author(s)"

The main function of this extracellular, non-living layer, commonly referred to as a membrane, is to protect and waterproof the plant surface. Although not structurally or chemically homogeneous, cuticles are usually characterised by two specific classes of lipid substances. The insoluble high molecular weight polyester cutins constitute the framework of the membrane, the monomeric units of which are biosynthesised in the epidermal cells from CIÓ and Cis fatty acid precursors. The soluble long-chain wax constituents are also synthesised by these cells and are eventually deposited not only on the cuticular surface but also within the cutin matrix. Epicuticular waxes have a considerable influence on the wettability of a plant surface whereas the presence of intracuticular waxes governs cuticular permeability. The cuticles of some species also contain variable amounts of another aliphatic biopolymer, cutin, which is non-saponifiable and, consequently, extremely resistant to biodegradation. Because the cuticle is an integral part of the epidermal cell wall, polysaccharides and probably, phenolic compounds are also involved in its construction."

A number of studies have addressed the muscular control, kinematics, and hydrodynamics of flexible fins, but little work has investigated just how flexible ray-finned fish fin rays are, and how flexibility affects their response to environmental perturbations. Analysis of pectoral fin rays of bluegill sunfish showed that the more proximal portion of the fin ray is unsegmented while the distal 60% of the fin ray is segmented. We examined the range of motion and curvatures of the pectoral fin rays of bluegill sunfish during steady swimming, turning maneuvers, and hovering behaviors and during a vortex perturbation impacting the fin during the fin beat. Under normal swimming conditions, curvatures did not exceed 0.029 mm-1 in the proximal, unsegmented portion of the fin ray and 0.065 mm-1 in the distal, segmented portion of the fin ray. When perturbed by a vortex jet traveling at approximately 1ms-1 (67±2.3 mN s.e. of force at impact), the fin ray underwent a maximum curvature of 9.38 mm-1. Buckling of the fin ray was constrained to the area of impact and did not disrupt the motion of the pectoral fin during swimming. Flexural stiffness of the fin ray was calculated to be 565×10-6 Nm2. In computational fluid dynamic simulations of the fin-vortex interaction, very flexible fin rays showed a combination of attraction and repulsion to impacting vortex dipoles. Due to their small bending rigidity (or flexural stiffness), impacting vortices transferred little force to the fin ray. Conversely, stiffer fin rays experienced rapid small-amplitude oscillations from vortex impacts, with large impact forces all along the length of the fin ray. Segmentation is a key design feature of ray-finned fish fin rays, and may serve as a means of making a flexible fin ray out of a rigid material (bone). This flexibility may offer intrinsic damping of environmental fluid perturbations encountered by swimming fish. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

The Salvinia sp. biomass was a better sorbent for oil than Peat Sorb (for a crude oil, 4.8 against 2.7 g of oil sorbed per g of biomass).

The roots, mainly the fraction less than 1 mm, contain a smaller percentage of hydrophobic groups, most of the mineral constituents (ash), and higher surface area (and porosity).

The wide range of variability and adaptation of the foot is unparalleled in other lizard groups. The Tokay (Gekko gecko (Linnaeus) 1785) has been used as a basis for a broader study of the comparative and functional anatomy of the foot within the family Gekkonidae. The acquisition of adhesive pads by Gekko has resulted in the development of a very distinctive mode of locomotion which has become modified both to deploy and, at the same time, protect the delicate subdigital setae. Analysis of the structure and function of the foot has been carried out in two stages: firstly a description of the mechanical units and then an interpretation of their function, with the aid of high speed cinematographic data. The skeletal elements of the foot exhibit several features which reflect the specialized method of locomotion and these are related to remarkable adaptations exhibited by the associated muscular, vascular and tendon systems. The functional significance of scansorial plates is discussed and the relationship between size and locomotory ability within the family Gekkonidae is also considered. Some ideas as to the selective advantage of the particular locomotory modifications under discussion are presented, but further consideration of this topic must wait until subsequent papers deal with a larger proportion of the family. This paper highlights the significant role of scansorial plates in the locomotory abilities of geckos, particularly the Tokay gecko (Gekko gecko). These adhesive foot structures offer substantial advantages, such as increased efficiency in climbing across various surfaces. The study suggests that the gecko's small size, combined with these specialized plates, may have been selected for evolutionary benefits, given the limits of adhesive capacity at larger sizes. The analysis of the foot's anatomy reveals that multiple scansorial plates allow for better control and protection of the setae compared to a single large plate. This complex system involves intricate interactions between muscles, tendons, and the blood system, forming a highly integrated unit for locomotion."

By contrast, typical synthetic materials cannot grow and reconstruct their structures once formed. We propose a strategy for developing “self-growing” polymeric materials that respond to repetitive mechanical stress through an effective mechanochemical transduction. Robust double-network hydrogels provided with a sustained monomer supply undergo self-growth, and the materials are substantially strengthened under repetitive loading through a structural destruction-reconstruction process. This strategy also endows the hydrogels with tailored functions at desired positions by mechanical stamping. This work may pave the way for the development of self-growing gel materials for applications such as soft robots and intelligent devices. © 2019 American Association for the Advancement of Science.
