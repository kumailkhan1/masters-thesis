A study of the silent flight of the owl,"Many species of owl, including the barn and barred owl, use both visual and bi-aurallocation to search for prey around dusk and at night. Their bi-aural location system has a maximum sensitivity between 3-6kHz although the hearing of the owl has an upperlimit in excess of 20kHz. Its prey, typically voles and mice, squeak and and squeal in the frequency range of 3-6kHz and this range of frequency includes the rustling of leavesmade by prey. The hearing of these prey is acute between 2-20kHz. The owl in both gliding and flapping flight generates noise at low frequencies below 2kHz, but is almosttotally silent at frequencies above 2kHz. Hence the flight of the owl is almost silent to its prey. When an owl attacks its prey from its perch from a height of 6-10m the prey are unaware of its approach before they are captured by its long talons.The noise suppression devices developed by owls during their long evolution period of millions of years have been identified. They comprise (i) leading edge feathers in the form of a comb, (ii) trailing edge feathers in the form of a fringe, and (iii) fluffy down on the wings and legs.The paper discusses the aerodynamic characteristics of each of these devices and sug-gests tentative explanations as to how these flow characteristics lead to a large reduction in the noise generated by the owl in flight and especially in its critical range of frequencies above 2kHz.",How can advancements in aerodynamic design lead to quieter propulsion systems in modern transport technologies?,What innovations in flight mechanics can be developed to achieve near-silent movement in aerial devices?,"Explore new materials or textures that could help reduce turbulence or vibration in fast-moving vehicles, leading to quieter operation.",How can the structure of noise-reducing technologies in aviation be optimized to operate across a wide range of frequencies?,What features in fluid dynamics can be applied to enhance stealth and reduce sound emissions in moving systems?
Three-dimensional shape of natural riblets in the white shark: relationship between the denticle morphology and swimming speed of sharks,"The ridges of the dermal denticles of migratory sharks have inspired riblets to reduce the frictional drag of a fluid. In particular, the dermal denticles of white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are characterized by a high middle ridge and low side ridges. The detailed morphology of their denticles and their variation along the body, however, have never been investigated. Moreover, the hydrodynamic function of high–low combinations of ridges is unknown. In this article, the ridge spacings and heights of the white shark denticles were three-dimensionally quantified using microfocus X-ray computed tomography. Then, the swimming speed at which the ridges would reduce drag was hydrodynamically calculated with a flat plate body model and previous riblet data. High ridges with a large spacing were found to effectively reduce drag at a migration speed of 2.3 m s?1, while adjacent high and low ridges with a small spacing reduced drag at a burst hunting speed of 5.1 m s?1. Moreover, the above hydrodynamic calculation method was also applied to the shortfin mako shark and an extinct giant shark (called megalodon) with known ridge spacings, resulting in the estimated hunting speeds of 10.5 m s?1and 5.9 m s?1, respectively.",What modifications to surface textures of submarines or underwater drones can improve speed and efficiency?,"How can the surface design of high-speed transportation systems, such as trains or cars, be optimized to reduce friction at different speeds?",What innovative surface engineering techniques can be developed to optimize movement efficiency in high-speed transportation systems?,Investigate ways to enhance the performance of wind or water turbines by improving the interaction between surface structure and flow dynamics.,What micro-surface textures can we design that reduces wear and tear of high-speed machinery
Why do woodpeckers resist head impact injury: A biomechanical investigation,"Head injury is a leading cause of morbidity and death in both industrialized and developing countries. It is estimated that brain injuries account for 15% of the burden of fatalities and disabilities, and represent the leading cause of death in young adults. Brain injury may be caused by an impact or a sudden change in the linear and/or angular velocity of the head. However, the woodpecker does not experience any head injury at the high speed of 6-7 m/s with a deceleration of 1000 g when it drums a tree trunk. It is still not known how woodpeckers protect their brain from impact injury. In order to investigate this, two synchronous high-speed video systems were used to observe the pecking process, and the force sensor was used to measure the peck force. The mechanical properties and macro/micro morphological structure in woodpecker's head were investigated using a mechanical testing system and micro-CT scanning. Finite element (FE) models of the woodpecker's head were established to study the dynamic intracranial responses. The result showed that macro/micro morphology of cranial bone and beak can be recognized as a major contributor to non-impact-injuries. © 2011 Wang et al.","Design an advanced helmet system that incorporates adaptive materials to distribute impact forces more evenly, enhancing protection for high-impact sports.",How can car seat designs be optimized to better absorb and mitigate forces during severe collisions,"Create a shock-absorbing padding for protective gear that dynamically adjusts its properties to manage sudden impacts effectively, inspired by natural systems.",What safety precautions can be made to safety restraints in aircraft to better manage forces during turbulence or abrupt maneuvers,"Develop a new material for construction that can better withstand high-impact forces or shocks, reducing structural damage during extreme events."
Light on the moth-eye corneal nipple array of butterflies,"The outer surface of the facet lenses in the compound eyes of moths consists of an array of excessive cuticular protuberances, termed corneal nipples. We have investigated the moth-eye corneal nipple array of the facet lenses of 19 diurnal butterfly species by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscope, as well as by optical modelling. The nipples appeared to be arranged in domains with almost crystalline, hexagonal packing. The nipple distances were found to vary only slightly, ranging from about 180 to 240?nm, but the nipple heights varied between 0 (papilionids) and 230?nm (a nymphalid), in good agreement with previous work. The nipples create an interface with a gradient refractive index between that of air and the facet lens material, because their distance is distinctly smaller than the wavelength of light. The gradient in the refractive index was deduced from effective medium theory. By dividing the height of the nipple layer into 100 thin slices, an optical multilayer model could be applied to calculate the reflectance of the facet lenses as a function of height, polarization and angle of incidence. The reflectance progressively diminished with increased nipple height. Nipples with a paraboloid shape and height 250?nm, touching each other at the base, virtually completely reduced the reflectance for normally incident light. The calculated dependence of the reflectance on polarization and angle of incidence agreed well with experimental data, underscoring the validity of the modelling. The corneal nipples presumably mainly function to reduce the eye glare of moths that are inactive during the day, so to make them less visible for predators. Moths are probably ancestral to the diurnal butterflies, suggesting that the reduced size of the nipples of most butterfly species indicates a vanishing trait. This effect is extreme in papilionids, which have virtually absent nipples, in line with their highly developed status. A similar evolutionary development can be noticed for the tapetum of the ommatidia of lepidopteran eyes. It is most elaborate in moth-eyes, but strongly reduced in most diurnal butterflies and absent in papilionids.",Design an anti-reflective coating for high-definition displays that improves light absorption and reduces reflections across different viewing angles.,How can the surface of optical elements in cameras be engineered to minimize light reflection and enhance image clarity?,Create a surface treatment for solar cell panels that enhances light capture,Exploring ways to enhance anti-reflective coatings through the use of microstructures for optical systems,How can surface patterns be optimized to minimize unwanted reflections in optical systems?
Mosquito proboscis: An elegant biomicroelectromechanical system,"The mouthparts of female mosquitoes have evolved to form a special proboscis, a natural biomicroelectromechanical system (BMEMS), which is used for painlessly penetrating human skin and sucking blood. Scanning electron microscope observations show that the mosquito proboscis consists of a small bundle of long, tapering, and feeding stylets that are collectively called the fascicle, and a large scaly outer lower lip called the labium. During blood feeding, only the fascicle penetrates into the skin while the labium buckles back to remain on the surface of the skin. Here, we measured the dynamic force of penetration of the fascicle into human skin to reveal the mechanical principle underlying the painless process of penetration. High-speed video observations of movements associated with insertion of the fascicle indicate that the “smart” mosquito does not directly pierce its victim’s skin with the fascicle. Instead, it uses the two maxillas as variable frequency microsaws with nanosharp teeth to advance into the skin tissue. This elegant BMEMS enables the mosquito to insert its feeding fascicle into human skin using an exceedingly small force (average of 16.5????N).",Design a high-precision insertion system for industrial applications that minimizes the force required for penetration into various materials,How can we develop advanced cutting mechanisms for manufacturing processes that optimize force distribution and reduce wear on tools?,Create a novel micro-mechanical interface for handling delicate materials that leverages nanoscale features to minimize damage and improve precision.,What new approaches can be employed in the design of automated systems to achieve effective interaction with soft or complex materials using minimal applied force?,Develop a breakthrough technology for in Medical that stitches the wounds automatically and safely
Geometry for low-inertia aerosol capture: Lessons from fog-basking beetles,"Water in the form of windborne fog droplets supports life in many coastal arid regions, where natural selection has driven nontrivial physical adaptation toward its separation and collection. For two species of Namib desert beetle whose body geometry makes for a poor filter, subtle modifications in shape and texture have been previously associated with improved performance by facilitating water drainage from its collecting surface. However, little is known about the relevance of these modifications to the flow physics that underlies droplets’ impaction in the first place. We find, through coupled experiments and simulations, that such alterations can produce large relative gains in water collection by encouraging droplets to “slip” toward targets at the millimetric scale, and by disrupting boundary and lubrication layer effects at the microscopic scale. Our results offer a lesson in biological fog collection and design principles for controlling particle separation beyond the specific case of fog-basking beetles. © The Author(s) 2024.",How can surface textures on drones be optimized to improve efficiency in collecting and channeling airborne particles or moisture in flight?,Develop a new coating for vehicle windshields that reduces water accumulation by utilizing microscopic textures to enhance droplet runoff and visibility during rain.,What design alterations can be made to industrial cooling systems to enhance the capture and redirection of moisture ,How can surface design improve the efficiency of capturing airborne particles in dry environments?,What design strategies can improve the collection of low-mass particles in high-flow environments?
Light collection and solar sensing through the polar bear pelt,"The pelt of polar bears acts as a translucent insulation through the hairs of which diffuse light is transferred by a combination of scattered light and luminescence light collection. The optical and morphological differences with respect to the white hair of other mammals have been investigated by scanning light microscope and UV-laser-induced luminescence studies and model experiments performed which support the suggested mechanism. An evaluation of physiological information on the energy turnover and dissipation in the polar bear suggests that comparatively little additional energy can be gained by harvesting solar radiation. However, due to the peculiar energy transparent pelt of the polar and the significant cooling of peripheral tissues suffered during cold ambient conditions, solar irradiation may change subcutaneous temperatures by as much as 10°C. It is suggested that the polar bear's skin, using the temperature pattern produced on its surface by scattered light, calibrated for wind chill against the body-temperature-controlled latissimus sheets, may be used as a kind of sensory system. This may help the polar bear to determine the approximate position of the sun and thus to navigate under diffuse arctic visibility but also to locate ice-free sea surfaces with significantly reduced light scattering properties as compared with ice-covered surfaces.",How can materials used in energy-harvesting devices be improved to optimize thermal protection in extreme environments?,What innovative solutions can be applied to wearable technology to improve thermal regulation in cold climates without compromising mobility?,How might navigation systems in autonomous vehicles be enhanced to function more effectively in low-visibility conditions?,Explore ways to design a building insulation material that efficiently balances temperature control and natural light usage in both hot and cold climates.,What design insights from nature can inform the development of adaptive insulation systems in variable climates?
Diffractive hygrochromic effect in the cuticle of the hercules beetle Dynastes hercules,"The elytra from dry specimens of the hercules beetle, Dynastes hercules appear khaki-green in a dry atmosphere and turn black passively under high humidity levels. New scanning electron images, spectrophotometric measurements and physical modelling are used to unveil the mechanism of this colouration switch. The visible dry-state greenish colouration originates from a widely open porous layer located 3m below the cuticle surface. The structure of this layer is three-dimensional, with a network of filamentary strings, arranged in layers parallel to the cuticle surface and stiffening an array of strong cylindrical pillars oriented normal to the surface. Unexpectedly, diffraction plays a significant role in the broadband colouration of the cuticle in the dry state. The backscattering caused by this layer disappears when water infiltrates the structure and weakens the refractive index differences.",How can advanced materials be developed to automatically adapt their appearance based on environmental moisture?,Exploring moisture-sensitive surface designs for applications in smart textiles and responsive materials,What design principles can be applied to improve moisture-sensitive sensors for better water or fog detection,How can light-diffraction principles be used to develop color-changing surfaces for energy-efficient displays?,How can passive light-diffusing materials be designed for solar panels or windows to improve efficiency in changing weather conditions
The Dynamics of Embolism Repair in Xylem: In Vivo Visualizations Using High-Resolution Computed Tomography,"Water moves through plants under tension and in a thermodynamically metastable state, leaving the nonliving vessels that transport this water vulnerable to blockage by gas embolisms. Failure to reestablish flow in embolized vessels can lead to systemic loss of hydraulic conductivity and ultimately death. Most plants have developed a mechanism to restore vessel functionality by refilling embolized vessels, but the details of this process in vessel networks under tension have remained unclear for decades. Here we present, to our knowledge, the first in vivo visualization and quantification of the refilling process for any species using high-resolution x-ray computed tomography. Successful vessel refilling in grapevine (Vitis vinifera) was dependent on water influx from surrounding living tissue at a rate of 6 × 10?4 ?m s?1, with individual droplets expanding over time, filling vessels, and forcing the dissolution of entrapped gas. Both filling and draining processes could be observed in the same vessel, indicating that successful refilling requires hydraulic isolation from tensions that would otherwise prevent embolism repair. Our study demonstrates that despite the presence of tensions in the bulk xylem, plants are able to restore hydraulic conductivity in the xylem.

Boxfish swimming paradox resolved: forces by the flow of water around the body promote manoeuvrability,"The shape of the carapace protecting the body of boxfishes has been attributed an important hydrodynamic role in drag reduction and in providing automatic, flow-direction realignment. However, tight swimming-course stabilization is paradoxical given the frequent, high-performance manoeuvring that boxfishes display in their spatially complex, coral reef territories. Here, by performing flow-tank measurements of hydrodynamic drag and yaw moments together with computational fluid dynamics simulations, we reverse several assumptions about the hydrodynamic role of the boxfish carapace. Firstly, despite serving as a model system in aerodynamic design, drag-reduction performance was relatively low compared with more generalized fish morphologies. Secondly, the current theory of course stabilization owing to flow over the boxfish carapace was rejected, as destabilizing moments were found consistently. This solves the boxfish swimming paradox: destabilizing moments enhance manoeuvrability, which is in accordance with the ecological demands for efficient turning and tilting.",Design a vehicle that can get stabilized from an unstable position.,Explore methods to design vehicle exteriors that balances opposite air force with enhanced steering capabilities,How can counterintuitive flow dynamics be applied to improve movement control in robotic systems?,What design principles can improve rapid directional changes in vehicles navigating complex environments?,How can unsteady forces contribute to enhanced agility in underwater craft designs?
Morphology and Dispersal Potential of Wind-Dispersed Diaspores of Neotropical Trees,"Morphological and aerodynamic traits affecting mean potential dispersal distance are quantified for wind-dispersed diaspores of tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The sample includes 34 species in 16 families and represents six aerodynamic groups. Mass and area (maximum cross section) each vary over six orders of magnitude among the species. In contrast, wing-loading, defined as weight divided by area, varies over only one order of magnitude, as does the rate of descent. While the regression of rate of descent on the square root of wing-loading is significant overall, the slopes vary significantly among five aerodynamic groups. At comparable wing-loading values, diaspores of fluffy kapok fall faster than four other aerodynamic groups and rolling autogyros fall faster than non-rolling autogyros. Assuming the diaspores are released from their typical tree height and experience a mean windspeed of 1.75 m·sec-1, the expected mean dispersal distance varies among the 34 species from 22 to 194 m. Rate of descent is weakly correlated with shade tolerance of seedlings for a subset of 18 species; rate of descent is more strongly correlated with the log of dry mass of seed for all 34 species. Given these wide differences in dispersal potential, any generalizations about tropical trees that use wind dispersal are of dubious value.",How can the design of airborne delivery drones be improved to optimize travel distance?,What design principles can help in creating objects that fall slowly and maintain stability when dropped from height?,How can gliding and descent mechanics be applied to the design of emergency descent systems in aerospace technologies to ensure smooth landings in diverse environmental conditions?,Explore streamlined designs for integrating passive movement systems into autonomous vehicles for wind-driven travel over extended distances.,How can I create a new parachute that falls slowly and provides more stability?
A new raptorial dinosaur with exceptionally long feathering provides insights into dromaeosaurid flight performance,"Microraptorines are a group of predatory dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaurs with aerodynamic capacity. These close relatives of birds are essential for testing hypotheses explaining the origin and early evolution of avian flight. Here we describe a new ‘four-winged’ microraptorine, Changyuraptor yangi, from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota of China. With tail feathers that are nearly 30cm long, roughly 30% the length of the skeleton, the new fossil possesses the longest known feathers for any non-avian dinosaur. Furthermore, it is the largest theropod with long, pennaceous feathers attached to the lower hind limbs (that is, ‘hindwings’). The lengthy feathered tail of the new fossil provides insight into the flight performance of microraptorines and how they may have maintained aerial competency at larger body sizes. We demonstrate how the low-aspect-ratio tail of the new fossil would have acted as a pitch control structure reducing landing speed and thus playing a key role in landing.",How can the design of control systems in UAVs be improved to enhance aircraft's touchdown stability ,Explore ways to use small yet wide surfaces to improve maneuverability and splashdown precision in aerospace designs,Design extensions for unmanned aerial systems that enhance stability during rapid changes in flight angle,How can flexible surfaces aid descent control in drones?,"How can the aircraft's be designed to reduce their descent speed before touchdown?

Investigating the Locomotion of the Sandfish in Desert Sand Using NMR-Imaging,"The sandfish (Scincus scincus) is a lizard having the remarkable ability to move through desert sand for significant distances. It is well adapted to living in loose sand by virtue of a combination of morphological and behavioural specializations. We investigated the bodyform of the sandfish using 3D-laserscanning and explored its locomotion in loose desert sand using fast nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging. The sandfish exhibits an in-plane meandering motion with a frequency of about 3 Hz and an amplitude of about half its body length accompanied by swimming-like (or trotting) movements of its limbs. No torsion of the body was observed, a movement required for a digging-behaviour. Simple calculations based on the Janssen model for granular material related to our findings on bodyform and locomotor behaviour render a local decompaction of the sand surrounding the moving sandfish very likely. Thus the sand locally behaves as a viscous fluid and not as a solid material. In this fluidised sand the sandfish is able to “swim” using its limbs.",How can we design robots that can traverse in deserts?,Develop advanced portable excavation tools that can be used in desert-like conditions?,How can compact locomotion systems be developed to navigate ashes-like substrates with minimal resistance?,How can robots be designed which have the ability to perform under-rubble or under-earth conditions?,"What design adaptations can improve propulsion in machines moving through unstable, semi-fluid environments?"
"Jumping and take-off in a winged scorpion fly (Mecoptera, Panorpa communis)","High-speed videos were used to analyse whether and how adults of a winged species of scorpion fly (Mecoptera, Panorpa communis) jump and determine whether they use the same mechanism as that of the only other mecopteran known to jump, the wingless snow flea, Boreus hyemalis. Adult females are longer and heavier than males and have longer legs, but of the same relative proportions. The middle legs are 20% longer and the hind legs 60% longer than the front legs. A jump starts with the middle and hind legs in variable positions, but together, by depressing their coxo-trochanteral and extending their femoro-tibial joints, they accelerate the body in 16–19?ms to mean take-off velocities of 0.7–0.8?m?s?1; performances in males and females were not significantly different. Depression of the wings accompanies these leg movements, but clipping them does not affect jump performance. Smooth transition to flapping flight occurs once airborne with little loss of energy to body rotation. Ninety percent of the jumps analysed occurred without an observable stimulus; the remaining 10% were in response to a mechanical touch. The performance of these jumps was not significantly different. In its fastest jumps, a scorpion fly experiences an acceleration of 10 g, expends 23?µJ of energy and requires a power output less than 250?W?kg?1 of muscle that can be met by direct muscle contractions without invoking an indirect power amplification mechanism.

Plant cuticles: Physicochemical characteristics and biosynthesis,"Cuticles are the thin continuous layers of predominantly lipid material deposited on the outer walls of epidermal cells and, thus, the interface between higher plants and their aerial environment. The main function of this extracellular, non-living layer, commonly referred to as a membrane, is to protect and waterproof the plant surface. Although not structurally or chemically homogeneous, cuticles are usually characterised by two specific classes of lipid substances. The insoluble high molecular weight polyester cutins constitute the framework of the membrane, the monomeric units of which are biosynthesised in the epidermal cells from CIÓ and Cis fatty acid precursors. The soluble long-chain wax constituents are also synthesised by these cells and are eventually deposited not only on the cuticular surface but also within the cutin matrix. Epicuticular waxes have a considerable influence on the wettability of a plant surface whereas the presence of intracuticular waxes governs cuticular permeability. The cuticles of some species also contain variable amounts of another aliphatic biopolymer, cutin, which is non-saponifiable and, consequently, extremely resistant to biodegradation. Because the cuticle is an integral part of the epidermal cell wall, polysaccharides and probably, phenolic compounds are also involved in its construction.",Design a self-cleaning surface for outdoor equipment that repels dirt and water effectively.,Create a dirt-repelling and water repelling gel that can be applied on cars.,Design a nanostructured surface for wind turbines that prevents dirt build-up and reduces maintenance.,Adaptive exterior coatings that respond to atmospheric changes.,Nano-scale natural defenses that inspire technological breakthroughs.
Functional morphology of the fin rays of teleost fishes,"Ray-finned fishes are notable for having flexible fins that allow for the control of fluid forces. A number of studies have addressed the muscular control, kinematics, and hydrodynamics of flexible fins, but little work has investigated just how flexible ray-finned fish fin rays are, and how flexibility affects their response to environmental perturbations. Analysis of pectoral fin rays of bluegill sunfish showed that the more proximal portion of the fin ray is unsegmented while the distal 60% of the fin ray is segmented. We examined the range of motion and curvatures of the pectoral fin rays of bluegill sunfish during steady swimming, turning maneuvers, and hovering behaviors and during a vortex perturbation impacting the fin during the fin beat. Under normal swimming conditions, curvatures did not exceed 0.029 mm-1 in the proximal, unsegmented portion of the fin ray and 0.065 mm-1 in the distal, segmented portion of the fin ray. When perturbed by a vortex jet traveling at approximately 1ms-1 (67±2.3 mN s.e. of force at impact), the fin ray underwent a maximum curvature of 9.38 mm-1. Buckling of the fin ray was constrained to the area of impact and did not disrupt the motion of the pectoral fin during swimming. Flexural stiffness of the fin ray was calculated to be 565×10-6 Nm2. In computational fluid dynamic simulations of the fin-vortex interaction, very flexible fin rays showed a combination of attraction and repulsion to impacting vortex dipoles. Due to their small bending rigidity (or flexural stiffness), impacting vortices transferred little force to the fin ray. Conversely, stiffer fin rays experienced rapid small-amplitude oscillations from vortex impacts, with large impact forces all along the length of the fin ray. Segmentation is a key design feature of ray-finned fish fin rays, and may serve as a means of making a flexible fin ray out of a rigid material (bone). This flexibility may offer intrinsic damping of environmental fluid perturbations encountered by swimming fish. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Develop a robotic gripper that adapts to the shape of objects for a secure and gentle grip,Design structure that can automatically adapt to changing loads,Design of prosthetic limbs that need to adapt to different surfaces or forces,Structural innovations for controlled deformation in high-stress conditions,Adaptive segmented materials that optimize flexibility and strength
"A contribution to the functional analysis of the foot of the Tokay, Gekko gecko (Reptilia: Gekkonidae)","The foot of gekkonid lizards, because of the wide range of variation it displays within the family, is an ideal system on which to carry out a functional anatomical study. The wide range of variability and adaptation of the foot is unparalleled in other lizard groups. The Tokay (Gekko gecko (Linnaeus) 1785) has been used as a basis for a broader study of the comparative and functional anatomy of the foot within the family Gekkonidae. The acquisition of adhesive pads by Gekko has resulted in the development of a very distinctive mode of locomotion which has become modified both to deploy and, at the same time, protect the delicate subdigital setae. Analysis of the structure and function of the foot has been carried out in two stages: firstly a description of the mechanical units and then an interpretation of their function, with the aid of high speed cinematographic data. The skeletal elements of the foot exhibit several features which reflect the specialized method of locomotion and these are related to remarkable adaptations exhibited by the associated muscular, vascular and tendon systems. The functional significance of scansorial plates is discussed and the relationship between size and locomotory ability within the family Gekkonidae is also considered. Some ideas as to the selective advantage of the particular locomotory modifications under discussion are presented, but further consideration of this topic must wait until subsequent papers deal with a larger proportion of the family.

Mechanoresponsive self-growing hydrogels inspired by muscle training,"Living tissues, such as muscle, autonomously grow and remodel themselves to adapt to their surrounding mechanical environment through metabolic processes. By contrast, typical synthetic materials cannot grow and reconstruct their structures once formed. We propose a strategy for developing “self-growing” polymeric materials that respond to repetitive mechanical stress through an effective mechanochemical transduction. Robust double-network hydrogels provided with a sustained monomer supply undergo self-growth, and the materials are substantially strengthened under repetitive loading through a structural destruction-reconstruction process. This strategy also endows the hydrogels with tailored functions at desired positions by mechanical stamping. This work may pave the way for the development of self-growing gel materials for applications such as soft robots and intelligent devices. © 2019 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The salvinia paradox: superhydrophobic surfaces with hydrophilic pins for air retention under water,"A novel mechanism for long-term air retention under water is found in the sophisticated surface design of the water fern SaMnIa. Its floating leaves are evenly covered with complex hydrophobic hairs retaining a layer of air when submerged under water. Surprisingly the terminal cells of the hairs are hydrophilic. These hydrophilic patches stabilize the air layer by pinning the air-water interface.

Sorption of oils by the nonliving biomass of a Salvinia sp.,"The sorption of oils onto the dry biomass of the aquaphyte Salvinia sp. was studied at laboratory scale, and the results were compared to that obtained with a commercial oil sorbent, Peat Sorb, a processed peat. Studies included physical, chemical, and physicochemical characterization of the aquaphyte and the peat. The Salvinia sp. biomass was a better sorbent for oil than Peat Sorb (for a crude oil, 4.8 against 2.7 g of oil sorbed per g of biomass). Main factors that control the sorption process were the hydrophobicity of the biomass, particle size, the chemico-physical composition of the plant and the sorbate, and the capillary suction displayed by the plant biomass. The leaves of the plant, distributed primarily in the fraction greater than 1 mm, contain the majority of the hydrophobic groups, coming from microstructures (cuticular folds and wax crystal) and epicuticular wax. The capillary may arise from both the micropores and from the interstices between hair-like surface projections. The roots, mainly the fraction less than 1 mm, contain a smaller percentage of hydrophobic groups, most of the mineral constituents (ash), and higher surface area (and porosity). Together, the hydrophobicity and the capillary effect due to pore structure of the plant and its parts are responsible for the oil sorption and the differences found. Technical implications of the practical use of this plant are considered in the final discussion.",How can materials with complex surface structures be used to enhance the capture of industrial contaminants?,What characteristics of porous materials can improve their ability to trap hazardous substances from liquids?,How can advanced porous designs improve fluid retention systems in industrial waste management?,How can small-scale material properties be manipulated to enhance fluid handling in filtration systems?,What are the best methods for engineering structures that effectively capture and retain unwanted fluids in environmental remediation?
