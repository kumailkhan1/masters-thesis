The conjecture states that the accuracy cannot increase if the states in M are merged with respect to an equivalence relation ∼ so that the result is a smaller automaton M∼. Put differently, merging states can never improve predictions. This is under the assumption that both M and M∼ are bottom-up deterministic and accept every tree in C. We prove that the conjecture holds, using a construction that turns any probabilistic version N∼ of M∼ into a probabilistic version N of M, such that N assigns at least as great a weight to each tree in C as N∼ does. © 2024 The Author(s)"

However, the field continues to investigate methods of determining how students might overcome obstacles to reach new outcomes. This article documents an exploration within the TRansforming Instruction in Undergraduate Mathematics via Primary Historical Sources (TRIUMPHS) project that combined transgressions theory and situated learning theory, thereby illuminating three components of the former—boundaries, transgressive actions, and outcomes. In this regard, we capture students’ Primary Source Project (PSP) learning experiences in Abstract Algebra courses and bring attention to the challenges in delineating these elements due to drawing upon data not initially collected with transgressions or situated learning theory in mind. Despite this limitation, we underscore the potential of utilizing the transgressions framework in the analysis of students’ unorthodox learning experiences, such as with PSPs, and provide insights for future studies in the field. © The Author(s) & Dept. of Mathematical Sciences-The University of Montana"

This method uses various methods, including qualitative and quantitative techniques, and thoroughly examines the literature. The design and development of this chemistry module using design thinking to empower students' innovation competencies are described in this article. The main challenge for the teaching implementation process that is capable of mastering the skills of generating new ideas and solving problems in the real world is preparing teaching materials, consuming time, and putting pressure on the teacher. Teachers need more support resources to translate the expected teaching practices. This effort aims to generate a new perspective in education, especially chemistry education, in developing student innovation competence in secondary schools in Malaysia. Therefore, this study aims to discuss the design and development research (DDR) approach used to develop a design thinking chemistry module using a DDR approach. The researcher will go through three study phases and use several different research approaches in each phase. In the first phase, the researcher investigated the teachers' needs in their pedagogy used in teaching and students' innovation competencies. The second phase is the design and development phase, involving the consensus of twelve experts in various fields, such as chemistry/science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), curriculum development, module construction experts, and research and innovation planning experts. Consequently, the final phase is implementation and evaluation, focusing on determining the module's effectiveness in teaching and learning. Expert consensus is the primary input in developing modules in Malaysian chemistry education. Malaysian education needs to bring a different educational paradigm and teaching strategy, which includes the impact of teacher pedagogy through design thinking in the future. The conclusion of this article proposes a conceptual framework for the research to contribute to the advancement of design thinking and chemistry education. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

A neural network, combined with a pseudo-arclength continuation, is proposed to construct bifurcation diagrams from parameterized nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, a neural network approach is also presented for solving eigenvalue problems to analyze solution linear stability, focusing on identifying the largest eigenvalue. The effectiveness of the proposed neural network is examined through experiments on the Bratu equation and the Burgers equation. Results from a finite difference method are also presented as comparison. Varying numbers of grid points are employed in each case to assess the behavior and accuracy of both the neural network and the finite difference method.

However, how HSIs serve STEM students is not well understood. Accordingly, guided by Garcia et al. (Review of Educational Research 89:5–745, 2019) multidimensional servingness framework, we conducted a systematic review of the research on STEM education within the HSI context. By attending to STEM education in conversations around how HSIs may serve Latinx students and their campus communities, our ultimate aim is to improve STEM education particularly at HSIs and advance STEM servingness more broadly. Results, main findings: Through our systematic review of STEM education research at HSIs, we identified (under)studied components of servingness and gaps within this literature base. Specifically, among the 128 qualifying articles, nearly two-thirds focused on student outcomes but overlooked institutions’ organizational context, raising questions about the effect(iveness) of the studied interventions. Additionally, we identified three thematic gaps in this literature: ghosting the HSI context (i.e., relying on HSIs as research sites without considering the unique HSI context); ghosting Latinx culture (i.e., decentering Latinx students and the Latinx community’s sociocultural aspects and assets), and ghosting people and places (i.e., under-examining certain student populations like Latino men in STEM and places like Hispanic-serving community colleges). Ultimately, our study extends the field’s understanding of servingness by attending to STEM education within the context of HSI institutions. Conclusions, brief summary, and potential implications: By systematically reviewing studies on STEM education at HSIs, we identified (under)studied components of servingness and patterned gaps within this literature. In doing so, we highlight opportunities to advance STEM servingness at HSIs through future research, policy, and practice. Collectively, these avenues hold the promise of improving STEM education and diversifying the STEM workforce. © The Author(s) 2024."

Liu and Li characterized a connected graph with a perfect matching with respect to the distance signless Laplacian spectral radius (Liu and Li, 2021). Win characterized a connected graph with a spanning k-tree via the number of connected components (Win, 1989). Motivated by Liu and Li's and Win's results, in this paper we investigate the relations between the spanning k-tree and the distance signless Laplacian spectral radius in a connected graph and prove an upper bound for η1(G) in a connected graph G to guarantee the existence of a spanning k-tree. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Though many protection mechanisms are provided, they have been proved easy to bypass, and the existed detection methods show poor performance when facing malicious documents with unknown vulnerabilities or with few malicious behaviors. In this paper, we first introduce the definition of im-documents, to describe those vulnerable documents which show implicitly malicious behaviors and escape most of public antivirus engines. Then we present GLDOC—a GCN based framework that is aimed at effectively detecting im-documents with dynamic analysis, and improving the possible blind spots of past detection methods. Besides the system call which is the only focus in most researches, we capture all dynamic behaviors in sandbox, take the process tree into consideration and reconstruct both of them into graphs. Using each line to learn each graph, GLDOC trains a 2-channel network as well as a classifier to formulate the malicious document detection problem into a graph learning and classification problem. Experiments show that GLDOC has a comprehensive balance of accuracy rate and false alarm rate − 95.33% and 4.33% respectively, outperforming other detection methods. When further testing in a simulated 5-day attacking scenario, our proposed framework still maintains a stable and high detection accuracy on the unknown vulnerabilities. © The Author(s) 2024."

We establish conditions under which the disease-free equilibrium of the model demonstrates local or global asymptotic stability, contingent on the efficacy of quarantine measures. Notably, we find that a strain with a quarantine reproduction number greater than 1 will out-compete a strain with a quarantine reproduction number less than 1, leading to its extinction under complete immunity conditions. Additionally, we identify scenarios where diseases persist in a sub-critical coexistence endemic equilibrium, despite one control reproduction number being below one. Our exploration of backward bifurcation reveals the model's capacity to accommodate the coexistence of the disease-free equilibrium with up to four endemic equilibria. Moreover, we demonstrate that the existence of cross-immunity enhances the coexistence of two strains. However, co-infections and imperfect quarantine measures pose significant challenges in containing outbreaks, sustaining the outbreak potential even with successful control of individual virus strains. Conversely, controlling outbreaks becomes more manageable in the absence of co-infections, especially with perfect quarantine measures. We conclude by advocating for public health strategies that address the complexities posed by co-infections, emphasizing the importance of simultaneously tackling multiple pathogens. © 2024 The Author(s)"

One approach was for PSTs to teach each other, video-record their teaching, and code types of questions asked by the teachers. For a mathematics practicum, PSTs coded questions in two broad categories with four question types: lower-order questions that elicited (a) yes/no response or (b) one-word/short-answer responses; and higher-order questions that prompted students to (c) explain a mathematical concept or their chosen strategy and (d) give reasons for their strategy choice. This mixed-methods study examined data from PSTs’ coding of their peers’ questions posed during fourth-grade mathematics lessons, comparing it with the teacher educator’s coding of the same questions. In addition, PSTs’ lesson reflections served as a data source for triangulation as well as a means to analyze PSTs’ learning from this task. The results indicated that PSTs coded questions more often as higher order than the teacher educator. The findings also revealed the PSTs’ tendency to ask lower-order questions to gather recall or procedural information from students more than higher-order questions that probed students for an explanation or justification of their chosen strategies to solve a problem. Furthermore, the PSTs’ reflections on the coding task showed that PSTs were not only surprised that so many posed questions were lower-order, but also felt that coding questions increased their awareness of question quality. Recommendations suggest approaches that can be incorporated into teacher education programs to develop PSTs’ questioning skills. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks. All rights reserved."

The optimization methodology is based on the modified version of Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (MMRFO) technique for minimizing the sum of squared errors (SSE) between the Experimentally measured stack voltage and the estimated voltage produced by the optimized model. In the modified methodology, the sine-cosine method has been utilized to enhance the global searching capability in the exploration phase and the local searching capability in the exploitation phase of the MRFO algorithm. In order to validate the effectiveness of the suggested methodology, four different case studies comprising standard benchmark 250 W PEMFC, BCS-500 W PEMFC, SR-12 500 W FC, and 1 kW Temasek stacks were utilized, and the attainments have been compared with the measured polarization characteristics. The attainments have been intensively compared with several metaheuristic algorithms (MA) including Tree growth Algorithm (TGA), Grey wolf optimizer (GWO), Whale optimization algorithm (WOA), Salp swarm algorithm (SSA), and original Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO), to confirm the superiority of the MMRFO against the compared techniques. The obtained results give a satisfactory agreement between the MMRFO-based model and the experimentally measured data. Finally, the achievements confirmed the effectiveness of the MMRFO over the basic MRFO algorithm and other novel metaheuristic algorithms in identifying PEMFC parameters. © 2024 The Authors"

Therefore, even though counting is an important first strategy for young children, it is vital to support the development of CC with NC strategies from the earliest stages of mathematics education. This study examined the success of an intervention to promote the use of CC and NC strategies and conceptual subitizing (CS). The study was conducted with a sample of N = 1017 Grade 1 students, and investigated whether the achievement gain was affected by the intervention setting: cooperative learning, individual support for low achievers, a combination of the two settings, and a control group. Students in the combined setting had greater achievement gains in CC with NC strategy use and CS than the control group and outperformed those in the other intervention groups in CS. The combined setting also benefitted low achievers in mathematics for CS, but not for CC and strategy use. A combination of cooperative learning and individual support seems to be the best option for improving the CS and CC and NC strategy use of first graders, especially low achievers in mathematics. © The Author(s) 2024."

In order to certify the superiority of these algorithms, standardized comparisons among them and against other physics-based algorithms are necessary. In this work, for Max-Cut problems up to 20,000 nodes, we benchmark QAIA against quantum annealing and other physics-based algorithms. We found that ballistic simulated bifurcation excelled for chimera and small-scale graphs, achieving nearly a 50-fold reduction in time-to-solution compared to quantum annealing. For large-scale graphs, discrete simulated bifurcation achieves the lowest time-to-target and outperforms D-Wave Advantage system when tasked with finding the maximum cut value in pegasus graphs.

To this end, an analytical framework of instrumental orchestrations within a GeoGebra environment was established. Data were collected from Chinese preservice mathematics teachers, including the videotapes of their simulated lessons, GeoGebra files, written documents, self-reflections, online speaking, etc. In the results, three participants’ changes in instrumental orchestrations were presented as main cases. It was found that the three preservice mathematics teachers’ types of instrumental orchestrations did not change, but the frequencies of those increased significantly. The changes in didactical configurations were mainly reflected in the layout of GeoGebra, and the changes in exploitation modes were mainly manifested in the techniques teachers use and the management of mathematics tasks. In addition, it was revealed that theoretical support (instrumental approach), technical support (knowledge about using GeoGebra), and community support (“Same Content Different Designs” activity and communicating and discussing with others) were useful course elements inviting changes in instrumental orchestrations.

They arise in diverse fields such as cryptography, communication theory, and quantum computing. Objects like this also lend themselves to compelling mathematics problems, such as the Hadamard conjecture. However, complex generalized weighing matrices, which generalize Hadamard matrices, have not received anything like the same level of scrutiny. Motivated by an application to the construction of quantum error-correcting codes, which we outline in the latter sections of this paper, we survey the existing literature on complex generalized weighing matrices. We discuss and extend upon the known existence conditions and constructions, and compile known existence results for small parameters. Using these matrices we construct Hermitian self orthogonal codes over finite fields of square order, and consequently some interesting quantum codes are constructed to demonstrate the value of complex generalized weighing matrices. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

We propose an efficient similarity query algorithm with access control based on Bkd-tree in this paper, in which a searchable encryption scheme is designed for similarity image retrieval, and the encrypted image is used to extract image features by a pre-trained CNN model.

After 75 years of development, holographic imaging has become a powerful tool for optical wavefront measurement and quantitative phase imaging. The emergence of this technology has given fresh energy to physics, biology, and materials science. Digital holography (DH) possesses the quantitative advantages of wide-field, non-contact, precise, and dynamic measurement capability for complex-waves. DH has unique capabilities for the propagation of optical fields by measuring light scattering with phase information. It offers quantitative visualization of the refractive index and thickness distribution of weak absorption samples, which plays a vital role in the pathophysiology of various diseases and the characterization of various materials. It provides a possibility to bridge the gap between the imaging and scattering disciplines. The propagation of wavefront is described by the complex amplitude. The complex-value in the complex-domain is reconstructed from the intensity-value measurement by camera in the real-domain. Here, we regard the process of holographic recording and reconstruction as a transformation between complex-domain and real-domain, and discuss the mathematics and physical principles of reconstruction. We review the DH in underlying principles, technical approaches, and the breadth of applications. We conclude with emerging challenges and opportunities based on combining holographic imaging with other methodologies that expand the scope and utility of holographic imaging even further.

However, students’ creativity assessment is challenging. Grounded on the paradigm that creativity is a tangible parameter, this study aims to explore students’ creative thinking skill via a reading-based creativity test. The test was developed by considering the creativity indicators defined by Paul Torrance, i.e., fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration. In this creativity test, the reading and the questions were designed to make students integrate their science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) knowledge. Based on the empirical validation, the creativity test had a reliability of 0.897, indicating that the test was reliable to measure students’ creativity. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the test was conducted online to 108 junior high school students in East Java, Indonesia. In general, the students achieved the highest level of creativity in terms of originality that gained average score of 3.63 (with scale 4.00). Meanwhile, they underperformed on the aspects of elaboration having average score of 2.40. There were 93 and 79 students who responded very well on the originality and fluency aspects, respectively. In contrast, respectively over 30% and 50% of students showed a lack of creativity on the aspect of flexibility and elaboration. These creativity assessment data are beneficial for educational stakeholders especially to increase the quality of teaching and learning related to STEAM education. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

However, the existing anonymization techniques often suffer lower execution efficiency and unnecessary information loss when dealing with complex data. Therefore, we propose a dynamic anonymity privacy-preserving model based on hierarchical sequential three-way decisions. Specifically, we first divide the data into multiple granularity spaces by attributes and dynamically process the data in the granularity spaces. Then, in a single granularity space, we construct a generalization hierarchy for the data based on the attributes generalization trees and divide it into the positive, negative and boundary regions based on anonymous parameter. Next, we can acquire the positive and boundary regions by generalization and dynamically update the processed data at the next granularity. After that, we suppress the data in the final negative and boundary regions while releasing the positive region. To further improve data availability, we combine the idea of differential privacy by adding noise data to the final boundary region enabling its release and propose an enhanced anonymity model. Finally, we compare our proposed algorithms with other methods on six datasets. Experimental results show that our method effectively reduces processing costs, improves data usability and protects data privacy. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

The methodology employs the Khater III method for deriving analytical solutions, while He’s VIM serves as a numerical validation tool, ensuring the accuracy and stability of the obtained results. This dual approach not only yields novel solutions but also provides a robust framework for analyzing complex wave phenomena in elastic media. The findings of this study have significant implications for material science and engineering applications, offering new insights into the behavior of waves in elastic rods. By bridging the gap between theoretical models and practical applications, this research contributes to the advancement of both mathematical theory and physical understanding of nonlinear wave dynamics. Situated within the domain of applied mathematics, with a focus on nonlinear wave equations, this work exemplifies the interdisciplinary nature of contemporary research in mathematical physics. The results presented herein open new avenues for future investigations in related fields and highlight the potential for innovative applications in material science and engineering. © The Author(s) 2024."

However, lack of studies looks into the relation between self-regulated learning specifically with academic buoyancy in secondary school mathematics learning. Therefore, this correlational study aims to assess the relationship between self-regulated learning and academic buoyancy in the context of mathematics learning. Using a sample of 463 secondary school students from FELDA area (southern and east coast area), data were collected from Academic Buoyancy Scale and Self-regulated Learning Questionnaire. Results showed that, overall students’ self-regulated learning was positively and significantly correlated with academic buoyancy (r=.696**). Besides, academic buoyancy was also positively correlated with all three phases of self-regulated learning namely forethought (r=.634**), performance (r=.535**) and reflection (r=.622**) phase. The findings of the study offer insights into the importance of having good selfregulated learning skills to be the protective factor in dealing with daily academic challenges in the mathematics learning setting. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

However, MAR applications are computationally intensive, leading to high energy consumption and latency issues. To address these challenges, this research presents a Hybrid Monte Carlo Tree Search (HMCTS) based task offloading scheme, combining a genetic algorithm with Monte Carlo tree search for efficient task management. The proposed method uses YoloV7 for object recognition and aims to reduce energy consumption, response time, and migration time. Experimental results demonstrate that the HMCTS approach significantly reduces energy consumption to 1290 kJ, response time to 24 ms, and migration time to 0.52 ms, outperforming existing techniques. These improvements highlight the potential of the HMCTS method for enhancing the performance of MAR applications. Proposed hybrid approach aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of task offloading in MAR applications. The HMCTS model dynamically offloads tasks to edge servers, optimizing scheduling time, response time, and energy consumption. © 2024 The Authors"

The framework of expectancy-value theory has been used widely in primary and secondary education and partly in tertiary education to assess the self-beliefs of students in terms of expectancy of success and perceived value of mathematics. Based on this framework, we measured how the intrinsic value, the attainment value, the utility value, and the cost of learning mathematics as well as the expectancy of success when learning mathematics developed during the secondary–tertiary transition of students into STEM fields. Data were collected in a quantitative repeated-measures questionnaire study with two measurement points (measurement point 1: n = 710, measurement point 2: n = 487, listwise: n = 409). We conducted a latent profile analysis to identify the prevalent patterns of mathematics self-beliefs, called profiles, at each of the two measurement points. We studied the relation of these profiles to prior education, achievement at school, and achievement at university. By performing a latent transition analysis, we determined the probabilities of transitioning from the initial profiles to the posterior profiles. Results: Our analysis revealed four distinct prevalent profiles at each measurement point, ranging from highly favorable (i.e., high expectancy, high value, low cost) to highly unfavorable with respect to learning mathematics. The profiles with favorable manifestations remained stable over time, while those with undesirable manifestations deteriorated further. We observed a sharp increase in cost across all profiles. Prior achievement correlated strongly with profile membership. Conclusions: The expenditure of time and energy increased sharply during the secondary–tertiary transition, independently of the students’ initial motivational patterns. The perceived utility of mathematics for potential future careers was shown to be a significant source of motivation. The role of mathematics in future careers should thus be made visible in university teaching. Keeping the detrimental development of initially undesirable motivational profiles in mind, university teachers should create ample opportunities for students to gain a sense of accomplishment. © The Author(s) 2024."

Hepatocyte apoptosis casts extensive impact in regulating chronic HCV infection. We propose a four dimensional deterministic model scheming the role of hepatocyte apoptosis and significance of HCV-specific CTL response in the intermediate stages of chronic HCV infection. Numerical simulation indicates that unregulated behavior of hepatocyte apoptosis triggers hepatocellular carcinoma and prolonged continuation of apoptosis induces liver damages. The system undergoes backward bifurcation and the value of the basic reproduction number R0=0.98<1 shows recurrence of infection. Local sensitivity analysis has been performed to reveal the most sensitive parameters responsible for the progression and mitigation of infection. In order to control of chronic HCV infection through pan-genotypic direct acting antiviral drugs (DAAs), impulsive differential equations are considered to study the effect of perfect drug adherence to both fixed and non-fixed dosing. For possible eradication of the chronic HCV infection, impulsive drug control suggests significant viral load reduction.

However, the Newcomb–Benford law (NBL), also known as the first-digit law or Benford's law, reveals a completely different fact: the distributions follows a logarithm-type law. This bias in the frequency of occurrence of the leading digits of numbers is evident in everything from the lengths of rivers, the areas of countries, stock prices, and population numbers. Omnipresence of NBL emerges in mathematics (the Fibonacci sequence, the distribution of prime numbers, etc.) and also in the field of physics (i.e. the half-lives of unstable nuclei). From the earliest years, a large bibliography has been developed and applied to many fields such as fraud detection in finances, international trade and election results analysis. Usually, the diagnosis of such works is reduced to a qualitative binary assessment (conformity or non-conformity). The present paper aims to establish a supervised methodology to address existing gaps and enhance the reliability of final decisions. These gaps include uncertainty about the minimum data volume required to validate Benford's Law, the low sensitivity of current metrics (Euclidean distance or Mean Absolute Difference) to detect minor levels of adulteration, and the need to quantify both the level and nature of adulteration. Two new procedures have been established coming from Signal Analysis and Processing theory. The first relates the deconvolution between the empirical leading digit distribution and the Benford one. The second procedure consists of obtaining the generating functions (via Hilbert and Fourier transforms) to increase the contrast between both functions: the empirical under research and Benford's as the reference. Based on calibrated datasets, we are able to quantify the magnitude of accidental errors or malicious fraud adulteration and make the discrimination between both. Finally, as benchmark, fifteen real-world datasets were studied. This study shows that most of datasets are suspicious of Fraud. Notably, in the field of human health, several datasets demonstrate significant fraudulent deviations, defying conventional patterns of fraud and error. This phenomenon has been termed Berserker Fraud. © 2024"

In the dynamics analysis session, Lyapunov exponents, bifurcation theory, and phase diagrams are used to analyze the effects of system parameters, coupling stiffness, and FO on the complex dynamical behaviors such as periodicity, pseudo-periodicity, and chaos oscillations. To suppress chaotic oscillations, a dynamic event-triggered finite-time prescribed performance controller is proposed. The unknown nonlinear functions are approximated through the interval type-3 fuzzy system (IT3FS) with an adaptive law. A novel finite-time prescribed performance function (finite-time PPF) is constructed to establish constrained boundaries for tracking errors. Compared with the existing PPFs, the proposed approach allows for more flexible setting of the convergence boundary before reaching steady-state. Subsequently, the constrained tracking errors are mapped to an unconstrained form using a nonlinear transformation function, whether the error constraint is symmetric or asymmetric. To circumvent the “explosion of complexity” arising from backstepping design process, a tracking differentiator (TD) is utilized. Additionally, to alleviate strain on communication resources, an event-triggered mechanism is devised to update control signals. The trigger threshold of the control signals can be adaptively adjusted based on the values of the Lyapunov function and the dynamic auxiliary variables. This control method guarantees finite-time convergence for all signals of the system. Finally, extensive simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The framework mathematically models various nonlinear behaviors (including mechanical nonlinearity, non-wind-induced aerodynamic nonlinearity, amplitude-dependent flutter complex mode and wind-induced aerodynamic damping, and nonlinear coupling of vertical aerostatic deformation) present in free-vibration wind tunnel tests. The identification of parameters of all concerned nonlinear models in this framework only requires displacement responses from simple free-vibration wind tunnel tests, which makes it convenient for practical engineering applications. Meanwhile, a corresponding numerical solving procedure for nonlinear aeroelastic responses is also developed. The feasibility of the proposed modeling framework is then cross-validated through wind tunnel tests with a novel large-amplitude testing device, and the coupled vertical aerostatic deformation observed under large amplitudes can be well predicted by an asymmetric lift force model in the framework. Then, based on the validated nonlinear aerodynamic force model, a three-dimensional (3D) nonlinear flutter analysis method for full-bridge is established, and the influences of 3D effects on nonlinear flutter are investigated. The results show that ignoring 3D effects will significantly misestimate the nonlinear flutter amplitudes. Finally, based on the results of wind tunnel tests, it is verified that the proposed modeling framework has the ability to predict nonlinear bifurcation behavior (i.e., the final state of vertical and torsional vibrations at a given wind speed depends on the initial conditions) that occurs in 2DOF (two-degree-of-freedom) coupled flutter. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Gender disparities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) affect a country's innovation and ability to tackle global challenges. Therefore, recent national education policies have looked for ways to promote gender equality, particularly in the STEM subjects. One problem is that teaching materials often lack female representation and recognition of female achievements and contributions to STEM subjects, affecting how female students perceive science. The study examines how female students aged 15 to 18 are impacted by gender disparity in their physics teaching materials and what importance they place on female role models. It encompasses 20 group interviews with female students (n = 80) in Switzerland, which were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results show that, aside from Marie Curie, female scientists are largely unknown to female students, contributing to the perception of physics as a male domain. Female role models are crucial for fostering interest, motivation, and self-esteem in STEM subjects. However, internalized gender stereotypes and fears of negative reactions from male peers counter the demand for greater visibility of female scientists. Despite these challenges, most female students advocate for more female role models in STEM to inspire future generations of female students to pursue a STEM career and foster positive social change. © 2024"

The Adomian decomposition method (ADM) and ADM-Pade approximation technique have been implemented to solve the governing equation. Environmental or climate changes, along with the propagation of air or water waves, can lead to uncertainties or ambiguities in initial or boundary conditions, as well as in parameter associated with the Coriolis effect. To address these uncertainties, this work aims to find the approximate fuzzy solution to the said physical problem by applying a double parametric approach with the help of ADM. To validate the obtained solution, comparisons are made between the fuzzy solutions and existing precise (crisp) solutions in specific cases. Furthermore, in another scenario involving the fuzzy solution, the ADM-Pade approach is employed. This implementation yields an approximate solution that exhibits higher accuracy and closely resembles a solitary wave solution, demonstrating a rapid convergence rate. The analysis of special cases shows a direct relationship between wave height and the Coriolis parameter and an inverse relationship between wavelength and the Coriolis parameter.

More specifically, it remains unclear whether deficits are restricted to visuospatial content or are more general and whether they could explain arithmetical impairment. Methods: Fifteen 5- to 12-year-old children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and 23 age-matched healthy controls performed a non-symbolic magnitude comparison task. Depending on the trial, participants had to compare stimuli with high or low visuospatial load (visuospatial stimuli or temporal sequence of visual stimuli). The participants also completed a battery of arithmetic skills (ZAREKI-R) and a battery of global cognitive functioning (WISC-V or WPPSI-IV), from which working memory and visuospatial indices were derived. Results: Children with 22q11.2DS responded as fast as healthy controls did but received fewer correct responses, irrespective of visuospatial load. In addition, their performance in the non-symbolic magnitude comparison task did not correlate with the ZAREKI total score, while the working memory index did. Conclusion: Children with 22q11.2DS might suffer from a global magnitude representation deficit rather than a specific deficit due to visuospatial load. However, this deficit alone does not seem to be related to arithmetic achievement. Working memory might be a better concern of interest in favoring arithmetic skills in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials, NCT04373226.

A prototype of this MPU with a compact planar size of 0.93λ0×0.93λ0 (λ0 is the free-space wavelength) is constructed and evaluated in microwave frequencies. Experimental results demonstrate the MPU’s ability to successfully solve arbitrary linear calculus equations. With the merits of compactness, easy integration, reconfigurability, and reusability, the proposed MPU provides a potential route for integrated analog computing with high speed of signal processing. © The Author(s) 2024."

Primary source readings and discussion frameworks can tangibly link data analysis to questions of values within data science, computing ethics, or statistics courses. The particular cases of Sir Francis Galton and Sir Ronald Fisher—both statisticians and eugenicists—provide a rich collection of easily accessible digitized primary source material as well as a vast number of related popular and technical publications. Galton and Fisher figured centrally in the development of statistics as it is currently practiced (a substantial proportion of the technical content of introductory statistics courses were introduced by these men). However, the familiar tools of correlation and hypothesis testing were developed to analyze human data, often in service to the cause of eugenics. This article critically describes how we embedded problematic primary sources from Galton and Fisher into our courses and the discussions that ensued.

For some tasks, it is more realistic in practice to search for a model architecture. In this paper, we introduce the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm which has achieved great success in classical neural architecture search to find good variational quantum circuits for two real-world tasks of ground state energy estimations and multimodal fusion. We adapt the Monte Carlo Tree Search to the quantum scenario by considering more sophisticated classifiers within the tree nodes to partition the search space into several subregions based on the model performance. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method has the ability to recognize good models from the vast search space in both tasks. More importantly, the discovered variational quantum circuits demonstrate their advantages in fusing multimodal features under the comprehensive consideration of parameter number and performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

Bifurcation analysis allows us to identify causes for backward bifurcation, thereby helping to design a strategy to avoid such phenomena for disease eradication. In this study, we perform an in-depth bifurcation analysis of a malaria model incorporating cross-border mobility between two countries to explore mobility's role in backward bifurcation. Our analysis reveals that cross-border mobility can be a primary driving force for backward bifurcation in malaria dynamics. This novel result with cross-border mobility bringing backward bifurcation advances the traditional idea of disease-induced death being the primary driver of backward bifurcation. Using the malaria case in Nepal with cross-border mobility between Nepal–India, we validated analytical results by numerical simulations. Our model predicts that the disease-free equilibrium exists only if cross-border mobility or infection abroad are absent and malaria eradication is possible in Nepal. Otherwise, there is the coexistence of three endemic equilibria with a lower and higher stable epidemic level. Results on the bifurcation of our model may be helpful to control dynamics in order to maintain the malaria epidemic at a low level if it cannot be eradicated due to the entry of cases through cross-border mobility. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Methods: Data were collected following class cancellations mandated by the Ministry of Education due to an outbreak of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in April 2022. A national parent organization developed self-report survey questionnaire, “Impact of the Pandemic-related School Closures/Class Cancellations” (IPRSCCC), assessed parents’ perceived impact of school cancellations on their child/children’ and on their adaptation. The online survey was available between May 4 and May 9, 2022, in 20 districts throughout Taiwan. Results: A total of 2126 parents representing 2592 children responded. Total scores on the IPRSCCC were significantly higher for parents of children whose classes were cancelled (n = 891) compared with parents whose children continued in-person classes (n = 1053). Parents perceived the class cancellations of the child/children disrupted daily routine, learning loss and impacted academic motivation. They also reported emotional stress and no time for rest, which were associated with parental burnout. However for these parents, there were no significant differences in scores between parents living in low and high socioeconomic areas. Only the subscale score for disrupted daily routine was significantly higher for fathers, and emotional stress was significantly higher for parents with two, or ≥ 3 children. When academic impacts were examined using national examination scores for 12th grade students, the percent of students with scores of ≤ 6 in English, Chinese, and mathematics was higher in 2022 than in 2020. Conclusions: Higher IPRSCCC scores for parents of children whose classes were cancelled provides additional evidence of the impact of disruptions of in-person classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Examination scores confirmed class cancellations impacted academic performance. © The Author(s) 2024."

If quantum algorithms are applied to perform these iterative operations, the rank-based attacks may be more threatening to multi-layer UOV, including Rainbow. In this paper, we propose a quantum rectangular MinRank attack called the Q-rMinRank attack, the first quantum approach to key recovery attacks on multi-layer UOV signatures. Our attack is a general model applicable to multi-layer UOV signature schemes, and in this paper, we provide examples of its application to Rainbow and the Korean TTA standard, HiMQ. We design two quantum oracle circuits to find the kernel in consideration of the depth-width trade-off of quantum circuits. One is to reduce the width of the quantum circuits using qubits as a minimum, and the other is to reduce the depth using parallelization instead of using a lot of qubits. By designing quantum circuits to find kernels with fewer quantum resources and complexity by adding mathematical techniques, we achieve quadratic speedup for the MinRank attack to recover the private keys of multi-layer UOV signatures. We also estimate quantum resources for the designed quantum circuits and analyze quantum complexity based on them. The width-optimized circuit recovers the private keys of Rainbow parameter set V with only 1089 logical qubits. The depth-optimized circuit recovers the private keys of Rainbow parameter set V with a quantum complexity of 2174, which is lower than the complexity of 2221 recovering the secret key of AES-192, which provides the same security level as parameter set III. © The Author(s) 2024."

Here, based on the DFT barrier of methylene-H abstraction by nitro group (HONO elimination) and the continuous reaction model, an experimentally comparable half-life of BDNPF is reported by transition state theory simulation. Rather than the HONO elimination-addition reactions, HONO bimolecular decompositions are preferred, where the energetically preferred pathway involves formation of N2O3, and generation of N2O4 and HNO catalyzed by HONO. Interestingly, newly reported transition state bifurcations lower the barriers and accelerate HONO decomposition, which also leads to the rate constant of generating HNO consistent with experiments. Moreover, HNO undertakes hydrogen transferred bimolecular pathway and HONO-catalyzed pathway to decompose into N2O and H2O.

Firstly, the torsional stiffness model of the coupling considering the influence of excess is constructed by using finite element and response surface theory, and it is verified that the model can make up for the shortcoming of losing high-frequency vibration information. Secondly, the sensitivity of the coupling torsional stiffness eigenvalues to the structure-excess parameter is explored using the Sobol’ method. Thirdly, the effects of structure-excess parameters on the vibration stability of the coupling were observed using bifurcation diagrams. By comparing the vibration characteristics of the coupling under different amounts of excess, it is found that the vibration state of the coupling tends to be chaotic, accompanied by unstable phenomena such as resonance, and the increase in excess helps to control the torsional angle of the coupling. At the same time, in the low excess state, the middle shaft thickness changes so that the coupling resonance region shows a concentration of characteristics, and the sensitivity of the vibration state of the coupling to the change of the inclination angle in the middle taper area is neglected. In the high excess condition, the change of the middle shaft thickness will lead to scattered degradation in the resonance region of the coupling, and the change of the inclination angle will lead to intermittent chaotic vibration of the coupling, causing unstable vibration of the coupling. The research results of this paper can not only make up for the loss of high-frequency vibration information of the coupling, but also control the vibration amplitude and vibration state of the coupling, so as to reduce the probability of damage to the coupling laminations. © 2024"

The system involves complex impact processes, including contact, deformation, recovery, and disengagement. To address the technical challenges posed by the system discontinuity at the moment of impact, we establish a mapping relation between impact events to solve the system response. Considering that the non-smooth moment of such systems exists only at the moment of contact with the impact surface, we chose to select the impact surface as a Poincaré cross-section. Two independent mappings were established to describe the transition of the oscillator from leaving the obstacle to the next contact with the obstacle, and from contacting the obstacle to leaving the obstacle. These two consecutive mappings were integrated into the plane to form a unified mapping. This method was employed to investigate the response probability density function of the system for autonomous and non-autonomous systems, respectively. The effectiveness of the methodology was validated by the use of Monte Carlo simulations, in addition to the discovery of the stochastic P-bifurcation phenomenon. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Based on this method, entire phase diagrams in the parameter space can be obtained by bifurcation tracking and continuation at low computational costs. Particular focus is put on problems with moving domains, e.g. free surface problems in fluid dynamics, since a moving mesh introduces a plethora of complicated nonlinearities to the system.

However, uncovering valuable insights from big data is like locating a needle in a haystack, and it is difficult for teachers to use educational big data on their own. This study aimed to understand changes in student participation rates during classes and teachers’ teaching styles by analyzing educational big data. In the analysis, data from 120 students and two mathematics class teachers at a public junior high school in Japan were used. We applied the pruned exact linear time (PELT) algorithm to automatically identify significant changes in student participation during class. Based on the information obtained, we analyzed the interaction logs of teachers’ e-book readers and clarified the relationship between student participation rates and teacher behavior patterns. Change point detection using the PELT algorithm showed a high F1-score of 0.7929, indicating good overall performance. We also investigated whether there was a relationship between class differences and teachers’ actions and found a statistically significant difference. The results provide clues for improving student learning engagement and teachers’ teaching styles, and they are expected to improve the quality of education by automatically identifying notable cases from educational big data.

All graphical representations and computational analyses were performed using Mathematica 12.0. • These classes are defined by utilizing a new q-differential operator. • The coefficient values |ai|(i=2,3,4) are investigated. • Toeplitz determinants, such as the second T2(2) and the third T3(1) order inequalities, are calculated. © 2024 The Author(s)"

First-principles calculations demonstrate significant compact of material type and elemental doping on interfacial compatibility between silicon oxycarbide and various electrolytes. By proposing several novel descriptors including interfacial adhesion and formation energies of frozen system with low computation cost, the amounts of demanded trainings data are significantly reduced.

To investigate this matter, we examined the performance of 127 third- and fourth-grade children who read aloud, in Hebrew, numbers with 2–5 digits. We found several key observations. First, we observed a substantial variation among the 3rd graders—7% and 59% errors in the top and bottom deciles, respectively. Second, the task difficulty stemmed from syntactic processing: Most errors were distortions of the number’s syntax, as opposed to digit substitutions or transpositions, and the main factor affecting a specific number’s difficulty was not its magnitude, as is commonly assumed, but rather its syntactic structure. Third, number reading performance was not predicted by a school-like task that assessed syntactic-conceptual knowledge of the decimal system structure, but rather by knowledge of specific syntactic-verbal rules, suggesting that the syntactic-verbal knowledge is separate from the syntactic-conceptual knowledge. Last, there was a double dissociation between 4-digit numbers and 5-digit numbers, which in Hebrew have completely different syntactic structures: Half of the children showed a significant advantage in one number length compared to the other, with equal numbers of children preferring either length. This indicates that the different syntactic-verbal rules are learned relatively independently of each other, with little or no generalization from one rule to another. In light of these findings, we propose that schools should specifically teach number reading, with focus on specific syntactic-verbal rules. © The Author(s) 2024."

The model assumes that the production output of the public firm is influenced by the past output levels of the private firms. The output levels of the private firms are affected by the past production outputs of both the public firm and their private competitors. The study identifies two equilibrium states within the nonlinear system: a positive equilibrium and a boundary equilibrium. Through a stability analysis, it is established that the boundary equilibrium is a saddle point. In the absence of time delays, the stability region for the positive equilibrium is determined. The research explores various specific delay scenarios, finding conditions under which the positive equilibrium is asymptotic stability. Additionally, the occurrence of flip and Neimark–Sacker bifurcations are examined.

Recent research has provided a lot of progress concerning the reconstruction of such networks from data as well as insight into their graph theoretical properties. However, methods and tools to quantify structural properties of networks or differences between them are still very limited. For example, for phylogenetic trees, it is common to use balance indices to draw conclusions concerning the underlying evolutionary model, and more than twenty such indices have been proposed and are used for different purposes. One of the most frequently used balance index for trees is the so-called total cophenetic index, which has several mathematically and biologically desirable properties. For networks, on the other hand, balance indices are to-date still scarce. In this contribution, we introduce the weighted total cophenetic index as a generalization of the total cophenetic index for trees to make it applicable to general phylogenetic networks. As we shall see, this index can be determined efficiently and behaves in a mathematical sound way, i.e., it satisfies so-called locality and recursiveness conditions. In addition, we analyze its extremal properties and, in particular, we investigate its maxima and minima as well as the structure of networks that achieve these values within the space of so-called level-1 networks. We finally briefly compare this novel index to the two other network balance indices available so-far. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Current approaches often struggle with session initiation, real-time data processing, and personalized learning experiences. To tackle these issues, the study proposes a manifold learning data analytics model (MLDAM). This innovative method leverages classifier tree learning to distinguish between trivial and non-trivial aspects of student learning experiences and session data. MLDAM integrates multi-dimensional data extraction, classification learning, and impact evaluation to enhance the effectiveness of online English language teaching. The model analyzes data from 176,009 English phrases across 36 online teaching sessions, focusing on improving session accessibility, student comprehension, and suggestion accuracy. Using an iterative training process based on student performance and feedback, it continuously extracts and processes multiple types of data to refine teaching strategies. Results show notable improvements: a 14.74% increase in classification accuracy, an 8.73% increase in data extraction ratio, an 11.84% reduction in feature discard, a 10.57% decrease in initialization time, and a 13.17% reduction in classification time. These metrics demonstrate MLDAM’s ability to efficiently process and analyze session data, enabling real-time adjustments during lessons. The model optimizes data utilization, making learning more responsive and adaptable.

However, for complex data sets, there might exist data points from different classes in the same local tree. In this article, we use pairwise constraint information to resolve this issue and propose a semi-supervised local density peaks and graph cut based clustering algorithm (SLDPC). In particular, SLDPC proposes intra-cluster conflict resolution and inter-cluster conflict resolution steps to split the local trees which are inconsistent with the provided pairwise constraint information. Theoretically, we show that the two steps will finish in a finite number of operations and the split local trees will be consistent with the pairwise constraint information. Subsequently, root node redirection and noise filtering steps are designed to avoid the local trees becoming too fragmented. Finally, we exploit the E2CP algorithm to further improve the similarity matrix between local trees using the pairwise constraint information, and the spectral clustering algorithm is adopted to obtain the clustering result. Experiments on multiple widely used synthetic and real-world data sets show that SLDPC is superior to LDP-SC and several other semi-supervised prominent clustering algorithms for most of the cases. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The influence of roadway shape on the evolution of static pressure was explored, and the role of pulverized coal in the process of static pressure dynamic disaster was clarified. The results indicated that the static pressure showed a fluctuating downward trend during the outburst process. When gas outburst, the middle and front parts of the roadway in the straight section roadway were the most serious areas of static pressure disasters in the three shapes of roadways. The duration and range of high static pressure disaster in L-shaped roadway were larger than those in T-shaped and straight roadways in turn. When CGO, the most serious area of static pressure disaster in L-shaped and T-shaped roadways moved backward to the middle of the straight section roadway, and there was a rebound phenomenon in the process of static pressure fluctuation decline, which showed the pulse characteristics of CGO. During the outburst, the static pressure dynamic disaster hazard of L-shaped roadway was higher than that of T-shaped roadway, and the static pressure at the bifurcation structure decayed faster than that at the turning structure, which indicated that T-shaped roadway was more conducive to the release of static pressure in roadway, thus reduced the risk of static pressure disaster. When gas outburst, the static pressure attenuation of the fluid in the roadway before and after the turning and bifurcation structure was greater than that of CGO. The peak static pressure and impulse of the fluid during gas outburst were 2 times and 4–5 times that of CGO respectively. The presence of pulverized coal reduced the attenuation of static pressure and the hazard of dynamic disaster, prolonged the release time of energy, and led to the change of the maximum static pressure disaster area. © The Author(s) 2024."

To investigate the pattern dynamics, we first give the occurrence conditions of the Turing bifurcation. It is found that there is no Turing bifurcation when predator-taxis disappears, while the Turing bifurcation occurs as predator-taxis is presented. Next, we establish the amplitude equation by virtue of weakly nonlinear analysis. Our theoretical result suggests the Lotka-Volterra model admits the supercritical or subcritical Turing bifurcation. In this manner, we can determine the stability of the bifurcating solution. Finally, some numerical simulation results verify the validity of the theoretical analysis. The stripe pattern, the mixed patterns, and wave patterns are performed.

That is, they need to assess students' learning outcomes accurately. Intervention studies that aimed at fostering (pre-service) teachers' assessment competencies during the assessment process show only limited effects on assessment accuracy. Adapting support measures to individual assessment processes has the potential to increase the effects. However, developing adaptive support requires a concise understanding of how assessment processes are related to individual learners’ dispositions (e.g., knowledge, interest) on the one hand and the accuracy of their assessments on the other. Aims: We aimed to characterize the relationships between pre-service teachers’ dispositions, assessment process, and assessment accuracy to establish a basis for adaptive support during the assessment process. Sample: We analysed 65 mathematics pre-service teachers’ assessment processes in a digital simulation of a task-based assessment situation. Methods: Pre-service teachers' assessment processes were measured by recording their log data in a digital simulation. Patterns of process indicators were interpreted as modes of cognitive engagement. Process indicators included participants' selections of mathematical tasks and their interpretations of simulated students’ task solutions. Results: We found pronounced individual differences in pre-service teachers' assessment processes, reflecting a passive, active, or constructive mode of engagement. Engagement modes were related to participants’ individual interest in student assessment. Moreover, engagement modes predicted differences in assessment accuracy above and beyond cognitive dispositions. Conclusions: Log data from a digital simulation help unravel the link between teachers' dispositions and accuracy in assessment situations. The results provide a basis for developing adaptive support for pre-service mathematics teachers’ assessment competencies. © 2024 The Authors"

To justify correctness properties of the safety-critical control algorithms for their physical models, differential dynamic logic ([Formula presented]) provides deductive specification and verification techniques implemented in the theorem prover [Formula presented]. The logic [Formula presented] is useful for proving, e.g., that all runs of a hybrid dynamical system α satisfy safety property φ (i.e., [Formula presented]), or that there is a run of the hybrid dynamical system α ultimately reaching the desired goal φ (i.e., [Formula presented]). Logical combinations of [Formula presented]'s operators naturally represent safety, liveness, stability and other properties. Variations of [Formula presented] serve additional purposes. Differential refinement logic ([Formula presented]) adds an operator α≤β expressing that hybrid system α refines hybrid system β, which is useful, e.g., for relating concrete system implementations α to their abstract verification models β. Just like [Formula presented], [Formula presented] is a logic closed under all operators, which opens up systematic ways of simultaneously relating systems and their properties, of reducing system properties to system relations or, vice versa, reducing system relations to system properties.

In this regard, airway segmentation plays a critical role in the production of the outline of the entire airway tree to enable estimation of disease extent and severity. Furthermore, the segmentation of a complete airway tree is challenging as the intensity, scale/size and shape of airway segments and their walls change across generations. The existing classical techniques either provide an undersegmented or oversegmented airway tree, and manual intervention is required for optimal airway tree segmentation. The recent development of deep learning methods provides a fully automatic way of segmenting airway trees; however, these methods usually require high GPU memory usage and are difficult to implement in low computational resource environments. Therefore, in this study, we propose a data-centric deep learning technique with big interpolated data, Interpolation-Split, to boost the segmentation performance of the airway tree. The proposed technique utilises interpolation and image split to improve data usefulness and quality. Then, an ensemble learning strategy is implemented to aggregate the segmented airway segments at different scales. In terms of average segmentation performance (dice similarity coefficient, DSC), our method (A) achieves 90.55%, 89.52%, and 85.80%; (B) outperforms the baseline models by 2.89%, 3.86%, and 3.87% on average; and (C) produces maximum segmentation performance gain by 14.11%, 9.28%, and 12.70% for individual cases when (1) nnU-Net with instant normalisation and leaky ReLU; (2) nnU-Net with batch normalisation and ReLU; and (3) modified dilated U-Net are used respectively. Our proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art airway segmentation approaches. Furthermore, our proposed technique has low RAM and GPU memory usage, and it is GPU memory-efficient and highly flexible, enabling it to be deployed on any 2D deep learning model. © The Author(s) 2024."

It is widely used in real scenarios and provides important support for big data mining and analysis. Most existing matching methods take the single-connected graph as the matching graph, which has a high computational cost. Simultaneously, the construction and matching complexity of its index on multi-connected temporal subgraph matching is high. To solve the above problems, we propose a new temporal subgraph matching problem for multi-connected temporal graphs and proposes the corresponding efficient filtering-selecting-matching three-stage multi-connected temporal subgraph matching method. In the filtering stage, a vertex-based filter is proposed to generate a candidate temporal subgraph set. In the select phase, a set of temporal subgraphs satisfying the vertex mapping is found. In the matching stage, the single-filter temporal subgraph matching method and temporal subgraph matching based on the temporal information tree index method are proposed to solve the problems that the edges of multi-connected temporal subgraphs cannot be mapped and the single graph matching efficiency is low, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the matching accuracy, and the corresponding index size is reduced. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Cruz et al. (2020) [7] presented a unified approach to identify extremal chemical trees for degree-based graph invariants in terms of graph order. The exponential augmented Zagreb index (EAZ) is a well-established graph invariant formulated for a graph G as [Formula presented] where di signifies the degree of vertex vi, and E(G) is the edge set. Due to some special counting features of EAZ, it was not covered by the aforementioned unified approach. As a result, the exploration of extremal chemical trees for this invariant was posed as an open problem in the same article.

In discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science, they have attained a lot of attention from both the structural and complexity perspectives. Nonetheless, disconnected graphs were usually omitted from the considerations with the explanation that it is sufficient to understand coverings of the connected components of the target graph by components of the source one. However, different (but equivalent) versions of the definition of covers of connected graphs generalize to non-equivalent definitions for disconnected graphs. The aim of this paper is to summarize this issue and to compare three different approaches to covers of disconnected graphs: (1) locally bijective homomorphisms, (2) globally surjective locally bijective homomorphisms (which we call surjective covers), and (3) locally bijective homomorphisms which cover every vertex the same number of times (which we call equitable covers). The standpoint of our comparison is the complexity of deciding if an input graph covers a fixed target graph. We show that both surjective and equitable covers satisfy what certainly is a natural and welcome property: covering a disconnected graph is polynomial-time decidable if such it is for every connected component of the graph, and it is NP-complete if it is NP-complete for at least one of its components. We further argue that the third variant, equitable covers, is the most natural one, namely when considering covers of colored graphs. Moreover, the complexity of surjective and equitable covers differ from the fixed parameter complexity point of view. In line with the current trends in topological graph theory, as well as its applications in mathematical physics, we consider graphs in a very general sense: our graphs may contain loops, multiple edges and also semi-edges. Moreover, both vertices and edges may be colored, in which case the covering projection must respect the colors. We conclude the paper by a complete characterization of the complexity of covering 2-vertex colored graphs, and show that poly-time/NP-completeness dichotomy holds true for this case. We actually aim for a stronger dichotomy. All our polynomial-time algorithms work for arbitrary input graphs, while the NP-completeness theorems hold true even in the case of simple input graphs. © 2024"

This is particularly the case in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education, which is a uniquely demanding and challenging field. This study examined the role of emotional regulation (ER) skills in STEM teachers’ stress, well-being, and burnout. The sample included 165 STEM teachers in middle and high schools who completed standard online questionnaires on ER, stress, well-being, and burnout. They were also asked to comment on three videos depicting authentic mathematical and pedagogical situations. The results indicated that contrary to popular belief, seniority was not linked with levels of stress, difficulties in ER, lower levels of well-being, or higher levels of burnout. A structural equation model and bootstrapping analysis showed teachers’ levels of stress predicted their well-being, and this link between stress and well-being was mediated by teachers’ level of difficulty in ER. The study highlights the importance of STEM teachers’ well-being and suggests the need to reduce stress and burnout by providing tools for teachers to regulate their emotions in the classroom. © The Author(s) 2024."

Despite the significant momentum recently gained by the FL paradigm, most of the existing approaches in the field neglect another key pillar for the trustworthiness of AI systems, namely explainability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for FL of fuzzy regression trees (FRTs), which are generally acknowledged as highly interpretable by-design models. The proposed FL procedure is designed for the scenario of horizontally partitioned data and is based on the transmission of aggregated statistics from the clients to a central server for the tree induction procedure. It is shown that the proposed approach faithfully approximates the ideal case in which the tree induction algorithm is applied on the union of all local datasets, while still ensuring privacy preservation. Furthermore, the FL approach brings benefits, in terms of generalization capability, compared to the local learning setting in which each participant learns its own FRT based only on the private, local, dataset. The adoption of linear models in the leaf nodes ensures a competitive level of performance, as assessed by an extensive experimental campaign on benchmark datasets. The analysis of the results covers both the aspects of accuracy and interpretability of FRT. Finally, we discuss the application of the proposed federated FRT to the task of Quality of Experience forecasting in an automotive case-study. © 2024 The Author(s)"

,,,Light collection and solar sensing through the polar bear pelt,,,,,,,,,,,"The pelt of polar bears acts as a translucent insulation through the hairs of which diffuse light is transferred by a combination of scattered light and luminescence light collection. The optical and morphological differences with respect to the white hair of other mammals have been investigated by scanning light microscope and UV-laser-induced luminescence studies and model experiments performed which support the suggested mechanism. An evaluation of physiological information on the energy turnover and dissipation in the polar bear suggests that comparatively little additional energy can be gained by harvesting solar radiation. However, due to the peculiar energy transparent pelt of the polar and the significant cooling of peripheral tissues suffered during cold ambient conditions, solar irradiation may change subcutaneous temperatures by as much as 10°C. It is suggested that the polar bear's skin, using the temperature pattern produced on its surface by scattered light, calibrated for wind chill against the body-temperature-controlled latissimus sheets, may be used as a kind of sensory system. This may help the polar bear to determine the approximate position of the sun and thus to navigate under diffuse arctic visibility but also to locate ice-free sea surfaces with significantly reduced light scattering properties as compared with ice-covered surfaces."
