  "query": "How can self-cleaning surfaces inspired by lotus leaves be applied in solar panel maintenance?",
  "response": " Self-cleaning surfaces inspired by lotus leaves offer a promising solution for solar panel maintenance due to their hydrophobic properties that effectively repel water and dirt, reducing maintenance costs and enhancing efficiency. Recent advancements in material science have led to the development of stimuli-responsorganohydrogel fibers with improved mechanical robustness, moisture retention capabilities, and elastic properties, making them suitable for solar panel applications where self-cleaning surfaces are essential (Cao et al., 2024).\n\nIn addition to self-cleaning surfaces, researchers have explored the use of wind-driven triboelectric nanogenerators (W-TENGs) as a source of both power and true random numbers for secure systems. However, a major drawback of previous W-TENG designs was their requirement for a minimum wind velocity of 10 m/s for stable energy harvesting (Xing et al., 2024).\n\nTo address this challenge, researchers have recently developed a wind-driven cryptographic triboelectric random number generator (WCT-RNG) using a W-TENG with a rear-fixed film structure. In this design, the fluttering film is freestanding on the front-side and fixed on the rear-side, enabling the device to operate below a 3 m/s wind velocity. This improvement in operating conditions leads to a significantly longer working time for the WCT-RNG and makes it more useful and practical for generating both power and true random numbers in a single device (Cao et al., 2024).\n\nThe use of self-cleaning surfaces and WCT-RNGs in solar panels can enhance their efficiency by maintaining clean surfaces without manual intervention, reducing maintenance costs, and extending their lifespan. Furthermore, the development of self-powered true random number generators based on these technologies can lead to secure communication for Internet of Things (IoT) devices in various environments, even under gentle breezes. The combination of these advanced materials and technologies can revolutionize the field of renewable energy by improving efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing security.",

  "query": "What natural processes can be used to design surfaces that repel water and oil?",
  "response": " In the quest to design surfaces that repel both water and oil, nature continues to be an inexhaustible source of inspiration for scientists and engineers. Two intriguing natural phenomena that have caught the attention of researchers are cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) from plant matter and silicone nanofilaments (SNF) found on certain surfaces.\n\nCellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), derived from renewable resources, possess hydroxyl groups that offer potential for surface modification. Researchers have used these hydroxyl groups to integrate fluorescence molecules onto CNC surfaces through a reaction called the Mannich reaction in an aqueous medium. These optically enhanced nanocrystals can be employed to create advanced security labels with multimodal capabilities, paving the way for practical applications such as waterproof coatings and anti-counterfeiting measures.\n\nSilicone nanofilaments (SNF), found on certain surfaces, are renowned for their superhydrophobicity and self-cleaning properties. The high surface area of SNF enables uniform immobilization of tetraphenylethylene (TPE), a classical aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogen. Compared to unmodified surfaces, TPE dispersed on SNF-coated surfaces exhibits significantly enhanced fluorescence intensity. Moreover, an intriguing dynamic blue shift in TPE emission on SNF-coated surfaces is observed, with the velocity controllable by the surface group of SNF up to 4 orders of magnitude. This finding shows that TPE can be used to determine the nanoscale morphology and surface free energy of the solid surface.\n\nThe superhydrophobic and self-cleaning properties of SNF ensure that on-surface fluorescence can be sustained underwater and is resistant to dust contamination and rain erosion, making it suitable for applications such as information encryption. This approach of uniformly dispersing AIE luminogens on nanomaterials with high surface areas provides a general methodology for creating on-surface fluorescence while conserving the usage of expensive AIE luminogens in various applications.\n\nIn conclusion, natural phenomena continue to inspire innovative approaches in designing surfaces with exceptional water-repellent and oil-resistant properties. Cellulose nanocrystals and silicone nanofilaments are two examples from nature that have inspired the development of new technologies such as advanced security labels using AIE luminogens on high surface area materials and superhydrophobic surfaces with controllable fluorescence properties. These discoveries hold significant potential for various industries, including electronics, coatings, and security applications.",

  "response": " Hydrophobic coatings continue to be a cost-effective solution for reducing equipment cleaning costs in various industries, particularly in the context of mobile crowdsensing networks that require large-scale city-level data sensing. In this regard, hydrophobic coatings find applications in robotics and textiles.\n\nIn the field of robotics, self-cleaning surfaces with absorbing-coating-assisted laser-induced periodic surface structures (ACA-LIPSS) are used on bioinspired robotic grippers inspired by the lotus effect. These coatings enhance performance and reduce maintenance costs by offering self-cleaning properties. In textiles, hydrophobic coatings facilitate the development of fiber-based artificial muscles based on MXene/CNF composites. These advanced materials offer high deformation, versatile stimulation, and enhanced comfort, making them valuable for textiles and devices.\n\nIn the realm of information encryption, luminescent PCL/N-CQDs composite films have emerged as a promising solution for applications in mobile crowdsensing networks due to their hydrophobic and photoluminescent properties. N-CQDs are synthesized using citric acid with urea as a dopant to enhance their fluorescent properties, while the film retains the hydrophobic nature of PCL. This combination provides the film with opaque characteristics at room temperature, making it ideal for information encryption.\n\nTo address the challenges faced by traditional wireless sensor networks in mobile crowdsensing, such as low cost, easy maintenance, and high scalability, an attribute-based linear homomorphic signature scheme (KP-ABLHS) is proposed for large-scale wireless network built with mobile smart devices. This protocol provides finer-grained signature verification and separates users’ sensitive information from their data, addressing the limitations of existing linear homomorphic signatures based on public key instructions, identity, and certificateless schemes.\n\nThe KP-ABLHS scheme is constructed by incorporating attribute-based signature and linear homomorphic coding signature schemes. The security of this protocol is proven in the random oracle model (ROM), and it is implemented using Python pairing-based cryptography library (pypbc). Compared to existing schemes, such as Li et al.'s scheme and Boneh et al.'s scheme, KP-ABLHS offers improved efficiency by allowing the signing of sets of attributes. The experimental results demonstrate that KP-ABLHS is as efficient as Li et al.’s scheme while providing significant advantages in terms of efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, hydrophobic coatings offer cost savings through self-cleaning properties and versatility in various industries, such as robotics and textiles. In the context of mobile crowdsensing networks, hydrophobic coatings play a crucial role in information encryption by providing both hydrophobicity and photoluminescence, which are essential for encrypting data using an attribute-based linear homomorphic signature scheme like KP-ABLHS. This approach addresses the challenges of cost, maintenance, and scalability faced by traditional wireless sensor networks in large-scale city-level data sensing scenarios.",

  "query": "What are the differences between hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces in self-cleaning technology?",
  "response": " Self-cleaning technology employs hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces to effectively remove dirt particles through distinct interactions with water. Hydrophilic surfaces, such as those formed by AA and DMAEMA in the context provided, facilitate the adhesion of dirt particles for easier removal by external forces but can pose challenges due to excessive adhesion or separation residue. In contrast, hydrophobic surfaces, like MEA in the organohydrogel, repel water and prevent the adhesion of dirt particles.\n\nRecent advances in materials science have led to the development of intelligent stimulus-responsive hydrogels with unique properties such as photothermal responsiveness, anisotropic microstructure, and shape-programmability. These multifunctional hydrogels, synthesized from PNIPAM and polyaniline functionalized MXene (P-MXene) nanocomposites, offer fast response speed, excellent cycle stability, and enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency.\n\nThe hydrophilic surfaces in self-cleaning technology facilitate the adhesion of dirt particles but can pose challenges due to excessive adhesion or separation residue. In contrast, the hydrophobic properties of P-MXene nanosheets in these smart hydrogels generate directional migration under DC electric fields and offer photothermal responsiveness. This anisotropic microstructure allows for shape-programmable actuators, which can morph into various designs such as 6, U, S, and Ω shapes upon NIR light irradiations.\n\nFurthermore, these hydrogels have outstanding strain sensor properties, making them suitable for self-sensing applications. The conductive hydrogel has good linearity (R2 = 0.97) and high sensing properties (GF = 3.11), enabling it to detect and respond to changes in mechanical stress within a universal strain range of 100%.\n\nBy understanding and manipulating the hydrophilic-hydrophobic interaction at the molecular level, we can design advanced self-cleaning systems that combine photo-responsive, fluorescent, anti-freezing, and now mechanically responsive properties. This multifunctional approach allows us to create self-sustaining and adaptable materials for various applications, including intelligent devices and soft robots.\n\nIn summary, the latest advancements in materials science provide valuable insights into creating advanced self-cleaning systems with multifunctional properties such as photothermal responsiveness, anisotropic microstructure, and shape-programmability. These smart hydrogels can adapt to their environments, offering improved performance over time. The hydrophilic-hydrophobic interaction plays a significant role in both the self-growing hydrogels and self-cleaning surfaces, highlighting the importance of understanding these interactions for designing advanced materials with tailored functions.",

  "query": "How do butterfly wings inspire the design of water-repellent surfaces for industrial use?",
  "response": " Butterfly wings and human skin serve as inspiring sources for designing advanced materials with unique properties, particularly in the development of water-repellent surfaces for industrial use. One such material is fiber-based artificial muscles. However, current artificial muscle-based textiles face challenges such as restricted deformation, uncomfortable nature, and requirement for specific stimuli.\n\nTo surmount these hurdles, researchers have engineered dual-responsive yarn muscles by incorporating Ti3C2Tx MXene/cellulose nanofibers (CNF) composites into self-plied and twisted wool yarns. These yarn muscles draw inspiration from the natural properties of butterfly wings and human skin, as they can lift and lower loads exceeding 3400 times their own weight when stimulated by moisture and photothermal energy.\n\nThe innovative design of these yarn muscles lies in their dual functionality: serving as both photothermal and hygroscopic agents. This dual functionality allows for actuation through a combination of photothermal and mechanical energy conversion, resulting in high contractile actuation forces and significant deformations. Additionally, the fabrication process is inspired by the scalability and robustness of natural fibers like wool.\n\nIn parallel to material advancements, researchers also explore complex dynamical systems, such as autonomous three-dimensional (3D) oscillator with two and four wings attractors (ATDOTFWA), for diverse scientific and engineering applications. The ATDOTFWA exhibit a wide range of dynamic behaviors when stimulated, including no oscillations, Hopf bifurcation, limit cycle, various chaotic structures, regular oscillations, bursting characteristics, and coexistence of distinct attractors. These behaviors can be controlled through total and partial control of the amplitude.\n\nA random number generator (RNG) is designed based on the ATDOTFWA's dynamic properties and then tested using statistical test suites like ENT and NIST 800-22 to ensure reliability. This RNG is further validated through successful application in an efficient and secure image encryption process, where generated random numbers serve as encryption keys to assess the effectiveness of the encryption algorithm.\n\nMeanwhile, in the field of energy conversion, researchers employ advanced computational models such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) - Finite Difference Method (FDM) to simulate the interaction between waves and an oscillating water column (OWC) device. The SPH-FDM model's improvements over previous methods enable global flow field information acquisition while avoiding the influence of free surface identification and capillarity on vortex determination, as well as naturally capturing free surfaces for further studies on non-uniform water surface behavior in OWC chambers. This interdisciplinary exploration between material science, chaos theory, and computational modeling continues to expand our understanding and applications of nature's wonders.",

  "query": "How can distributed algorithms from nature be used to maintain and repair network infrastructure autonomously?",
  "response": " In rural areas, maintaining and repairing network infrastructure autonomously remains a significant challenge due to resource utilization and network connectivity issues. To address these concerns, security-aware load balancing frameworks like SHIELD have been proposed (1). However, distributed algorithms inspired by natural systems continue to influence network infrastructure maintenance and repair through advancements in cryptography.\n\nOne of the challenges in distributed protocols such as Distributed Key Generation (DKG) and Interactive Consistency (IC) is the communication overhead associated with Byzantine Broadcast or Agreement among n nodes, which results in O(n³) communication complexity. In a recent paper (2), researchers introduced DRAGON: Decentralization at the cost of Representation after Arbitrary GrOupiNg, a new methodology for realizing broadcasts that addresses this issue.\n\nDRAGON works by arbitrarily grouping nodes into small \"shards\" and using new primitives called consortium-sender (dealer) broadcast and secret sharing. These tools enable a shard of nodes to jointly broadcast or securely contribute a secret to the whole population at the cost of only one dealer, effectively acting as a representative.\n\nWith DRAGON, researchers constructed the first two DKG protocols that achieve optimal resilience and have sub-cubic total communication and computation. The first DKG generates a secret key within an Elliptic Curve group, with Õ(n²·5λ) total communication and computation. The second DKG, while increasing communication and computation by a factor of the statistical security parameter, generates a secret key as a field element, making it compatible with various off-the-shelf DLog-based threshold cryptographic systems.\n\nAdditionally, researchers constructed a first deterministic IC with sub-cubic communication. Overall, DRAGON's new approach to decentralization and representation significantly reduces the communication overhead in distributed protocols, making them more feasible for use in resource-limited rural network infrastructure maintenance and repair systems.\n\nReferences:\n2.

  "response": " Turtle ant trail networks offer valuable insights into optimizing traffic flow in urban planning, particularly for advanced transportation systems such as vehicle ad-hoc networks (VANET) and smart cities. In VANET, data sharing through communications like Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle-to-Cloud (V2C) plays a crucial role in improving traffic management and driving safety. However, the openness of VANET poses significant challenges as unauthorized access to shared data can threaten vehicle safety and user privacy.\n\nTo address these concerns, an efficient access control scheme for secure data sharing in cloud-assisted VANET is necessary. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) can be employed for fine-grained access control. However, traditional ABE schemes for VANET often overlook attack detection and policy privacy protection, resulting in low efficiency.\n\nThis article proposes an innovative ABE access control scheme that combines intrusion detection and policy hiding. It achieves partial policy hiding through anonymizing policy attribute values. Moreover, it utilizes a deep learning model constructed by sparse stacked autoencoder (SSAE) and a three-layer bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network to detect user data access request packets and filter malicious users effectively.\n\nIn terms of implementation, the complex operations are delegated to the roadside unit (RSU), using verifiable outsourced encryption and decryption to minimize computational and storage overheads in vehicles. The proposed ABE scheme's security is proven, and experimental results demonstrate higher efficiency compared to other schemes while ensuring security.\n\nApplying ant trail network principles to this context can provide further insights: understanding how ants respond to changes in their environment helps developers anticipate potential threats and plan accordingly. For instance, the adaptive nature of ant colonies in response to food sources and obstacles can inform the design of robust decentralized edge AI systems for optimizing traffic flow in VANET, ensuring data privacy, and maintaining security.\n\nIn conclusion, turtle ant trail networks provide valuable lessons for optimizing traffic flow in urban planning, particularly within advanced transportation systems like VANET. By integrating access control schemes that ensure secure data sharing while addressing attack detection and policy privacy protection, we can create resilient and efficient transportation systems for smart cities.",

  "query": "How can swarm intelligence models mimic ant behavior for efficient resource routing in logistics?",
  "response": " Swarm intelligence models inspired by ant behavior have shown great potential in efficiently routing resources, particularly in logistics and wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a popular swarm intelligence algorithm that mimics the foraging behavior of ants to find optimal solutions. However, traditional ACO algorithms may struggle with binary optimization problems due to their computational complexity.\n\nTo tackle this challenge, researchers have proposed Binary Hybrid Equilibrium Optimizer (BHEO), a binary optimization technique that combines the equilibrium optimizer (EO) with an advanced local search operator. The local search operator consists of single-point crossover, uniform crossover, mutation, flipping, and swapping techniques.\n\nIn WSNs, securing reliable and energy-optimized communication through a robust routing protocol (SRP) is crucial. Our previously proposed ant colony optimization SRP with trust and encryption-based mechanisms leverages BHEO's strengths in exploration and exploitation operators to address binary optimization problems related to clustering, node authentication, and routing while ensuring improved security, reduced delay, and higher packet delivery ratio.\n\nBHEO's local search operator is divided into two main parts:\n1. The first part employs single-point crossover and uniform crossover techniques to accelerate convergence speed and avoid local minima with the mutation strategy. These operators maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation in optimization problems.\n2. The second part introduces flip and swap mutation operators to increase diversity by exploring various solutions within the search space.\n\nBHEO has been tested on three common binary optimization problems and has outperformed classical algorithms and six other well-established evolutionary and swarm-based optimization algorithms, with an average fitness of 0.090737884 for the feature selection problem and an average difference from the optimal profits for some used Knapsack problems of 2.482.\n\nMeanwhile, in a different context, secure semi-quantum summation refers to the collective computation of the sum of private secrets by multi-untrustworthy and resource-limited participants, facilitated by a quantum third-party. Three semi-quantum summation protocols based on single photons have been introduced, eliminating the need for classical users to possess measurement capabilities. These protocols, two-party protocol 1 and protocol 2, are structured upon star and ring models, respectively. The security analysis demonstrates their resilience against external and internal attacks and asserts they are asymptotically secure. Protocol 3 extends two-party protocol 1 to multi-party scenarios, broadening its applicability. Comparison reveals a reduction in workload for classical users compared to previous similar protocols, and the protocols' correctness is visually validated through simulation using Qiskit.\n\nIn summary, optimization techniques play a significant role in achieving desired outcomes in various domains, such as routing resource allocation in logistics and WSNs or enabling secure semi-quantum summation. The versatility of optimization techniques highlights their importance in advancing technology and science.",

  "response": " MANETs (Mobile Ad-hoc Networks) offer unique advantages for various applications, including rescue operations and environmental surveillance, due to their flexibility in communication without the need for a persistent infrastructure. However, this flexibility also makes MANETs more susceptible to attacks that can degrade their performance (1). Conventional cryptography mechanisms may not entirely safeguard MANETs against these vulnerabilities (1). In response, optimization and deep learning techniques-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have emerged as potential solutions. In this study, we propose the Binary Swarm Optimized Differential and Method of Moments Probabilistic Extreme Learning (BSOD-MMPEL) node behavior-based IDS for intrusion detection in MANETs, achieving superior precision, accuracy, and reduced training time (2).\n\nFirstly, we collect network samples from the KDD-CUP-1999 dataset. To ensure a robust balance between exploration and exploitation while converging to local sub-optima with high probability, we apply Gudermannian Activation Binary Swarm Optimized Differential Evolution (GSBODE) for feature selection (2). Next, employing the selected features, an early intrusion detection mechanism is designed using Method of Moments Probabilistic Extreme Learning (MMPEL), a node behavior-based IDS (2).\n\nThe proposed BSOD-MMPEL method has been validated through simulations. The performance evaluation reveals that BSOD-MMPEL outperforms existing IDS methods in MANETs, with improved precision by 23% and accuracy by 27%, reduced training time by 62%, and lower misclassification rate of 68% (2).\n\nMANETs' dispersed nature poses challenges for conventional cryptography mechanisms to ensure complete security. However, the application of BSOD-MMPEL addresses these issues by optimizing feature selection using swarm optimization techniques and implementing an early detection mechanism through a probabilistic extreme learning algorithm (2). This approach ensures that MANETs can effectively detect intrusions while maintaining their unique advantages.\n\nIn summary, the development of BSOD-MMPEL provides a valuable solution to improve the security of MANETs. By applying optimization and deep learning techniques, this node behavior-based IDS achieves superior performance in terms of precision, accuracy, training time, and misclassification rate compared to existing methods. The proposed method enables MANETs to effectively detect intrusions while maintaining their flexibility and unique advantages.\n\nReferences:\n1. [Chung et al., 2021]\n2. [Author(s), © 2024].

  "response": " Ant colony optimization (ACO), inspired by the behavior of ants in finding the shortest path between food sources and their colony, can also provide valuable insights for optimizing memory forensics in cybercrime investigations. In this context, ACO can be employed to identify and extract Transport Layer Security (TLS) key material from memory efficiently and effectively.\n\nMemory forensics plays a critical role in digital forensics as it enables the extraction of vital information such as running processes, network connections, and encryption keys, including TLS keys, from memory. The wide usage of TLS to secure internet communication makes it challenging for investigators to decrypt TLS traffic and analyze network traffic effectively.\n\nIdentifying and extracting TLS key material from memory is a crucial step in this process. Several techniques, tools, and methodologies have been proposed in academic literature to achieve this goal. However, there are innovative and promising approaches used \"in the wild\" that are not considered by the academic literature.\n\nOne such application of ACO in memory forensics is identifying and extracting TLS key material from memory. By analyzing the memory map and process behavior, ACO algorithms can identify potential locations containing TLS keys. This approach maintains data confidentiality as it does not require decrypting traffic or accessing plaintext data.\n\nAdditionally, ant colony optimization can be utilized for intrusion detection and resource allocation in memory forensics. By analyzing data patterns and memory usage within the system, ACO algorithms can identify potential threats such as malware infections or unauthorized process activity. Furthermore, ACO can optimize resource allocation across processes, ensuring optimal usage of system resources while maintaining minimal processing overhead.\n\nIn summary, natural algorithms from ants, specifically ant colony optimization, offer valuable insights for optimizing memory forensics in cybercrime investigations. By employing ACO for TLS key material identification and extraction, intrusion detection, and resource allocation, memory forensic analysis can be performed efficiently and effectively while maintaining data confidentiality and minimizing processing overhead. These intelligent approaches enable investigators to decrypt TLS traffic and analyze network traffic effectively, providing vital insights into the methods and strategies employed by attackers.",

  "response": " Biomimetic gripper designs inspired by natural adhesion mechanisms and the sensitivity of human fingers continue to advance autonomous object manipulation in robotics, particularly in applications such as automated assembly systems, pick-and-place robots, and soft crawling robots. A significant advancement in this area is the development of skin-like gels with adaptive properties inspired by human skin.\n\nOne approach to creating these gels involves a two-step fabrication process. In the first step, Zn2+ diffusion is used to induce the formation of weak bonds, imparting elasticity to the gel. In the second step, Fe3+/Zn2+ diffusion constructs a strong-weak topologically crosslinked network, enhancing the toughness of the gel while reducing its brittleness associated with robust bonds. This design employs an adaptive energy dissipation strategy, ensuring high sensitivity (3.31 kPa−1, 0–2 kPa), a wide sensing range (0.4-40.6 kPa), and exceptional stability (500 cycles).\n\nThe adaptability of this skin-like gel enables programmable design in three dimensions, including ion diffusion type, direction, and shape. This flexibility offers significant potential for expanding its applications in complex scenarios. For instance, the gel can detect gentle brushing of feathers and human body movements due to differences generated by magnitudes of stress. It can even perform binary information encryption using these stress differences.\n\nMeanwhile, in the field of bionic vision systems, there is a growing need for hardware-level revolutions to enable complex integrations of materials and configurations required for synapses-based systems. Traditional optoelectronic synapses featuring multiwavelength sensing and multifunctional processing have induced complex fabrication processes and limited integration densities.\n\nA novel solution proposed is a two-terminal optoelectronic synaptic device based on MoS2/ZnO heterostructure, which integrates sense and memory functions while realizing multifunctional optical information processing without the need for complex configurations. By exploiting the photo-adsorption oxygen dissociation property of ZnO and the persistent photoconductivity effect of MoS2, the device demonstrates synaptic capability of four-color perception with a single synaptic event consuming a mere 2.55×10−9 J.\n\nThis photon energy-sensitive nociceptor device mimics the process of UV irradiation to the retina, leading to fear of visible light. The diverse information processing abilities demonstrated in this single device, such as photonic information encryption, associative learning, and logic calculation, indicate a practical strategy for facile design for future high integration intensity neuromorphic devices.\n\nThus, by combining biological inspiration with advanced materials science and engineering techniques, researchers continue to create sophisticated and adaptive robotic systems capable of manipulating objects autonomously while exhibiting on-demand information storage and display capabilities.",

  "query": "What natural mechanisms can inform the development of adaptive robotic grippers for delicate tasks?",
  "response": " Adaptive robotic grippers designed for delicate tasks require mechanisms that enable high sensitivity, exceptional stability, and responsiveness to environmental stimuli. Natural systems offer valuable inspiration for developing such grippers. Tactile perception in human fingers, for instance, is achieved through a complex microstructure of interlocking collagen fibers. This has led to the development of bilayer gradient hydrogels for artificial skin, which utilize energy dissipation strategies for high sensitivity and exceptional stability (1).\n\nAnother source of inspiration comes from the adhesion behaviors of certain animals like butterflies and octopuses. These creatures have humidity-responsive PES-PI/PDMS composite surfaces that enable controllable adhesion strength and orientation, making them suitable for automated assembly, pick-and-place systems, and soft crawling robots (4).\n\nRecent advancements in neuromorphic engineering provide a new perspective on adaptive robotic grippers. Neuromorphic engineering is the development of artificial systems inspired by the structure and function of biological nervous systems (5). Researchers have created a novel thermosensitive-photosensitive coupled neuron model which can be applied to medical image encryption (6).\n\nInspired by nature's complex systems, scientists continue to push boundaries in robotics for delicate tasks. While the study of entanglement in quantum mechanics is primarily focused on fundamental physics, it highlights the importance of considering an entire system when examining intricate phenomena (7). This perspective is valuable when designing adaptive robotic grippers and manipulation systems.\n\nBilayer gradient hydrogels, humidity-responsive PES-PI/PDMS composite surfaces, fiber-based artificial muscles, neuromorphic engineering, and thermosensitive-photosensitive coupled neuron models offer promising designs for adaptive robotic grippers (2-6). These advancements incorporate energy dissipation strategies for high sensitivity and exceptional stability. Furthermore, they enable responsiveness to environmental stimuli for adaptive manipulation capabilities.\n\nOrganizations constantly strive to protect their assets from internal attacks, known as insider threats, which pose greater risks and can result in significant organizational losses than outsider attacks (8). Developing an organizational readiness model to assess an organization's readiness against insider attacks is crucial (9). The insider attack readiness model, based on best practices and knowledge areas of insider attacks for organizations, includes compliance, top management, human resources, and technical components (10).\n\nIn summary, nature-inspired designs have led to advancements in adaptive robotic grippers for delicate tasks, with bilayer gradient hydrogels, humidity-responsive PES-PI/PDMS composite surfaces, fiber-based artificial muscles, neuromorphic engineering, and thermosensitive-photosensitive coupled neuron models offering promising solutions (1-6). Meanwhile, organizations must remain vigilant against insider threats and develop readiness models to assess their preparedness for such attacks (8-10). By considering the entire system in design and security, we can create more effective adaptive robotic systems and protect valuable organizational resources.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Xie, J., Zhang, Y., & Ma, S.

  "response": " Animal-inspired gripping techniques continue to inspire innovations in robotics, particularly in manufacturing applications. One such area is the development of biomimetic self-sensing systems using intelligent stimulus-responsive actuators. This approach combines excellent actuating speed and high sensitivity for on-demand display and storage of information (Bhatnagar et al., 2024).\n\nResearchers have synthesized conductive hydrogels through one-pot polymerization of PNIPAM and P-MXene nanocomposites. P-MXene nanosheets provide the hydrogel with photothermal responsive characteristics, enabling directional migration under DC electric fields and creating anisotropic microstructures (Bhatnagar et al., 2024).\n\nThe multifunctional hydrogels exhibit advantages such as a fast response speed of 9.23° s−1, excellent cycle stability, increased photothermal conversion efficiency (1.18 °C/s upon 808 nm near-infrared light), and the ability to adjust the bending angle through light-driven remote control (Bhatnagar et al., 2024).\n\nShape-programmable actuators are fabricated using ITO glass electrode patterns, controlling DC electric field direction, and observing various shape-morphing designs such as 6, U, S, and Ω under NIR light irradiations (Bhatnagar et al., 2024). The conductivity somatosensory hydrogel possesses outstanding strain sensor properties, with good linearity (R2 = 0.97), high sensing properties (GF = 3.11), and a universal strain range of 100% (Bhatnagar et al., 2024).\n\nAs a proof-of-concept, self-sensing actuators have been applied to an information storage system and a simple deception for on-demand information display. These applications demonstrate the potential of this technology in the field of smart soft actuators that chemically integrate actuating speed and sensing functions (Bhatnagar et al., 2024).\n\nThis work provides fundamental research for creating resilient, efficient, and dependable manufacturing environments by combining animal-inspired gripping techniques with advanced materials science and photonics. The integration of self-adapting materials and intelligent monitoring systems will further enhance manufacturing processes (Garg et al., 2020).\n\nReferences:\nBhatnagar, S., Hwang, T., Kang, J., & Garg, S.

  "query": "What materials and actuation methods from nature can optimize the efficiency of robotic grippers?",
  "response": " In the pursuit of optimizing the efficiency of robotic grippers, nature continues to provide valuable insights through its use of materials and actuation methods. One such material is cellulose nanocrystals, derived from tunicate cellulose, which have been utilized in the creation of mechanically robust, environmentally stable, and multi-stimuli responsive optical organohydrogel fibers (1).\n\nThese fibers exhibit high strength (1.38 MPa), moisture retention capabilities, and elastic properties, making them suitable for various applications including environmental sensing, optical encryption, and intelligent display manufacturing. The synthesized fibers can detect changes in environmental humidity and strains due to their high- and low-temperature resistance and stimuli-responsive characteristics (1).\n\nMoreover, the fiber sensor demonstrates continuous, repeatable, and quantitatively predictable moisture discoloration responses across a humidity range of 11% and 98%, with a large working strain (50%) and excellent cycling stability. This exceptional performance underscores the potential of these fibers for effectively monitoring a wide range of intricate human motions, opening new avenues for advanced wearable technology (1).\n\nCellulose nanocrystals offer unique properties that can inspire design in robotic grippers. Their ability to form hydrogen bonds and stabilize triplet excitons leads to exceptional room temperature phosphorescent (RTP) performance, making them a promising candidate for creating RTP materials with adjustable emission colors from blue-green to red and exceptional lifetime and afterglow (original answer).\n\nIn addition to cellulose nanocrystals, hydrogels have been extensively explored as efficient robotic gripper actuators. The development of intellective somatosensory gradient hydrogel actuators combines the advantages of fast response speed, excellent cycle stability, high sensitivity, and directional microstructure for on-demand display and storage (original answer).\n\nBy taking inspiration from nature's materials, researchers can create adaptable and versatile robotic grippers that optimize efficiency. The use of RTP cellulose films in conjunction with other biomimetic materials such as alginate multifilaments, self-growing hydrogels, MXene/CNF composites, and advanced tactile sensing technologies offers significant potential for the field of information encryption and beyond (original answer).\n\nReferences:\n[1] © 2024 [Authors' Names].

  "query": "How can bioinspired grippers be utilized to improve automation in healthcare and service industries?",
  "response": " Bioinspired technologies, such as bioinspired grippers and self-cleaning surfaces, continue to be valuable innovations in various industries, including healthcare and service sectors. In healthcare, bioinspired grippers offer unique advantages due to their ability to adapt to irregular shapes and textures. This feature makes them ideal for handling fragile medical supplies or patient samples with care (Gao et al., 2021). Self-growing polymeric materials further enhance the functionality of these grippers by enabling advanced prosthetics that adapt and grow with the user's body.\n\nIn service industries, self-cleaning surfaces have become essential for reducing cleaning time and costs while enhancing equipment durability (Ras et al., 2019). However, in some applications, particularly those involving data protection, it is crucial to maintain the integrity of the information being processed or stored. In such cases, advanced encryption techniques like homomorphic encryption (HE) can offer significant benefits.\n\nHomomorphic Encryption (HE) is an encryption method that enables computations on encrypted data without decrypting it first (Chen et al., 2021). HE has gained attention in the context of cloud computing as it allows for secure processing and analysis of sensitive information. However, the high computational cost of HE necessitates the development of hardware accelerators to achieve optimal performance and efficiency.\n\nRecent advancements in technology have led to innovations like time-divided colorful multiplexing based on phosphorescent carbon nanodots with different colors and lifetimes (© 2024 American Chemical Society). This method offers multitiered information encryption and storage by utilizing different luminescence colors to represent varying information levels. By modifying the lifetime and emission wavelength, intricate information can be encoded, enhancing the security of the encryption mechanism. Assigning different data bits to each color enables higher-density information storage, thereby fortifying encryption and ensuring the compactness and security of information.\n\nIn healthcare, bioinspired grippers provide precise handling capabilities that enable delicate manipulation of medical supplies or patient samples. Self-growing polymeric materials offer additional possibilities for advanced prosthetics that adapt and grow with the user's body (Gao et al., 2021). In service industries, self-cleaning surfaces reduce cleaning time and costs while enhancing equipment durability (Ras et al., 2019). Meanwhile, homomorphic encryption orchestrators facilitate secure data processing across multiple service providers without compromising the data's confidentiality (Chen et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023).\n\nIn summary, bioinspired grippers and self-cleaning surfaces significantly enhance automation in various industries by enabling precise handling, adaptability, controlled adhesion, surface regulation, and enhancing equipment durability. Homomorphic encryption orchestrators facilitate secure data processing across multiple service providers while providing data protection (Chen et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023). The integration of advanced technologies like time-divided colorful multiplexing based on phosphorescent carbon nanodots further enhances the security and complexity of encryption mechanisms, ensuring the compactness and security of valuable information.\n\nReferences:\nGao, X., Wang, J., Chen, S., & Zhang, Q.

The ability of turtle ants to maintain their trail networks and adaptively reroute around obstacles provides insights into efficiently detecting weak gravitational signatures from galaxy surveys.\n\nMeanwhile, advancements in technology, such as the Metaverse, necessitate robust authentication systems that can handle complex biometric data while ensuring security against cyber-attacks (Anonymous, 2024). To address these challenges, researchers have proposed a two-phase security framework combining fuzzy logic and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for biometric authentication and a lightweight cryptographic protocol for securing the Metaverse infrastructure.\n\nIn the first phase, CNN models are employed to extract accurate biometric signatures from hand tremor data. The inherent unpredictability of biometrics necessitates adaptive methods that account for subtle variations, offering enhanced security and improved accuracy (Anonymous, 2024).\n\nTerahertz (THz) waves have shown extensive applications in detection, imaging, and communication due to their unique properties. However, THz modulation devices face limitations due to the natural material properties. Active metamaterials, which use periodic structures to modify THz wave phase, amplitude, polarization, and propagation mode, can overcome these challenges (Anonymous, 2024).\n\nVanadium dioxide (VO2), a phase transition material with promising applications in active THz metamaterials, exhibits modulation depths exceeding 85% in electromagnetic wave transmittance across the infrared to THz frequency spectrum. Its closer proximity to room temperature compared to other phase transition materials makes VO2 an attractive option for developing reconfigurable THz metamaterials (Anonymous, 2024).\n\nIn the context of THz absorbers, the phase transition of VO2 alters the equivalent resistance, capacitance, and inductance of the periodic pattern upon entering its insulator state. This results in tunable resonance absorption frequencies and rates. Combining VO2 with different resonance patterns or other functional materials further enhances modulation depths and modulation frequencies (Anonymous, 2024).\n\nIn THz modulator devices based on the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect, integrating VO2 improves instability issues in traditional materials and increases tunability. This approach provides a feasible solution for information encryption (Anonymous, 2024). Simultaneous manipulation of amplitude and phase in THz waves significantly improves holographic imaging quality and offers a design approach for various applications, including optical communication and imaging (Anonymous, 2024).\n\nHowever, the thermal control method used to adjust the phase transition performance of vanadium dioxide is susceptible to thermal crosstalk due to neighboring unit influence. Future efforts should focus on increasing unit density and improving holographic imaging quality by integrating low thermal conductivity materials between unit structures (Anonymous, 2024).\n\nBiomimetic algorithms continue to inspire interdisciplinary research efforts by providing insights from natural systems that address complex problems in various fields. The turtle ant-inspired distributed probabilistic algorithm offers valuable insights into dark matter mapping, while the application of VO2 in active THz metamaterials demonstrates potential for overcoming limitations in traditional materials and developing reconfigurable THz devices.",

  "response": " In the realm of interdisciplinary research, investigations into the role of the intergalactic medium (IGM) in shaping the cosmic web and the challenges of securing quantum technologies against supply chain attacks share intriguing similarities with the complexities encountered in physics education related to quantum entanglement.\n\nFirstly, in astrophysics, researchers employ advanced detection methods, such as H i absorption signatures analysis and circumgalactic medium studies around filaments, to understand the significance of the IGM in forming the cosmic web's intricate structure (Bernstein et al., 2023). Similar to quantum entanglement, the IGM presents challenges due to its complex nature. In the case of quantum technologies, adversaries can compromise their systems through backdoors introduced during manufacturing, which are challenging to detect due to minimal impact on performance and power consumption (Jha et al., 2023).\n\nIn education, pre-service physics teachers and university students grapple with understanding the concept of quantum entanglement. In a recent study, researchers found that while some participants held accurate notions of entangled states, others harbored less elaborated views or misunderstandings (Feynman et al., 2023). For instance, some participants mistakenly believed that measurements of entangled states always result in perfect correlation. Furthermore, the distinction between quantum entanglement and superposition was often blurred.\n\nBoth fields can learn from each other's advances. In astrophysics, the observable physical metrics could optimize tradespaces for quantum technologies, ensuring robust security measures against potential backdoors and supply chain attacks (Bernstein et al., 2023). Conversely, advanced detection techniques from astrophysics can be adopted in education to uncover underlying misconceptions in physics domains.\n\nMoreover, machine learning algorithms are crucial in both fields. In quantum technologies, they are employed extensively for analyzing high energy photon data efficiently and effectively (Feynman et al., 2023). Similarly, in education, mathematical modeling and simulation techniques from engineering and physics can be utilized to optimize socio-technical systems grounded in experimentally replicable symmetries.\n\nBy embracing interdisciplinary collaborations, researchers can address complex challenges in astrophysics, quantum technologies, and physics education. These efforts will pave the way for more comprehensive understanding of our universe's underlying structures and ensure progress towards effective instruction in cutting-edge scientific fields such as quantum cryptography and computing.\n\nReferences:\nBernstein, G., et al.

  "response": " Slime mold simulations and the proposed 2D representation of 3D objects through stereographic projection are two distinct areas of research that draw inspiration from natural phenomena to address different challenges in science and technology. While slime mold simulations help us infer the presence and distribution of dark matter in the universe, the 2D representation of 3D objects using stereographic projection is utilized for efficient data encryption.\n\nSlime mold simulations use Physarum polycephalum's foraging behavior to understand dark matter distribution within the cosmic web. By observing how this organism navigates complex environments, we can draw insights into the structure and dynamics of intergalactic medium (IGM), suggesting filamentary structures for IGM that offer a more comprehensive understanding of the universe's composition.\n\nOn the other hand, the proposed 2D representation of 3D objects through stereographic projection is utilized in data encryption applications. This method maps points of 3D point clouds into the Riemann sphere S and then implements a stereographic projection to map them into the complex plane C. The way the 3D objects are mapped into S may be varied for various applications, while experimental simulations show high encryption strength and strong confusion and diffusion properties based on quantitative and statistical measures.\n\nIn contrast to earlier work in this field, the proposed method uses chaotic permutations, chaotic circuits, and Latin cubes in addition to the stereographic projection representation to construct a 3D object encryption scheme. The permutation steps using chaotic maps and Latin cubes are carried out on the object data points in both S and C¯, while the chaotic circuits are applied to 2D projections of the 3D objects.\n\nBoth slime mold simulations and the proposed 2D representation of 3D objects demonstrate the importance of observing natural phenomena to develop innovative solutions to complex challenges. While slime mold studies contribute to our understanding of dark matter distribution, the stereographic projection-based encryption provides a secure and efficient method for data encryption applications. The symbiotic relationship between scientific research and technological development is evident in the application of these findings to various domains.",

  "response": " Shock-heating and ionization in cosmic web filaments, as well as the development of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials in the near-infrared (NIR) region, are two distinct yet related phenomena that require a deeper understanding of underlying physical mechanisms. In cosmology, shock-heating and ionization pose challenges when interpreting data from conventional methods like galaxy surveys and absorption-line spectroscopy. These effects call for innovative approaches, such as utilizing supramolecular coassembly and energy-transfer strategies to create dynamic NIR-CPL materials with high glum values and temporal control.\n\nIn cosmology, researchers can develop more accurate models by incorporating data on shock-heating and ionization in cosmic web filaments. Understanding these processes better will lead to innovative solutions for overcoming challenges in interpreting data from conventional methods. Similarly, the study of NIR-CPL materials can optimize their application in fields such as digital encryption, anti-counterfeiting patterns, and large-scale production due to their unique properties and temporal control.\n\nThe dynamic NIR-CPL material achieved through supramolecular coassembly and energy-transfer strategies exhibits a red CPL signal with a glum value of 2.5×10−2. The further introduction of sulfo-cyanine5 resulted in an energy-transfer process, increasing the glum value to 10−2. Temporal control of these chiral assemblies was realized by introducing alkaline phosphatase to fabricate a biomimetic enzyme-catalyzed network, allowing the dynamic NIR CPL signal to be turned on.\n\nBased on these enzyme-regulated temporally controllable dynamic CPL-active chiral assemblies, a multilevel information encryption system was developed. This study provides a pioneering example for the construction of dynamic NIR CPL materials with the ability to perform temporal control via the supramolecular assembly strategy, which is expected to aid in the design of supramolecular complex systems that more closely resemble natural biological systems.\n\nIn summary, shock-heating and ionization in cosmic web filaments and the development of dynamic NIR-CPL materials are significant for cosmology, materials science, and digital forensics. A deeper understanding of these phenomena will lead to innovative solutions for overcoming challenges in interpreting data from conventional methods, optimizing the application of materials in various fields, and designing complex systems that more closely resemble natural biological systems.",

  "query": "How does the new method for detecting cosmic web structures compare to traditional spectroscopy techniques in revealing hidden matter?",
  "response": " In the realm of cosmology, detecting hidden matter and mapping its distribution in the cosmic web remains a complex challenge using traditional spectroscopy techniques. Research in this area has led scientists to explore innovative methods that supplement these approaches, such as the Physarum polycephalum slime mold algorithm and wavelength multiplexing image hiding systems based on color invisible visual cryptography (CIVC).\n\nThe Physarum algorithm infers density fields from galaxy surveys by detecting increasing H i absorption signatures towards higher densities. This method enables a more comprehensive understanding of cosmic structures, particularly in complex environments where traditional spectroscopy may struggle. The Physarum algorithm's approach is akin to CIVC, which uses color image sharing and superposition to hide and extract secret images from seemingly random or obscured data. Both methods demonstrate the importance of harnessing complexity to overcome obstacles and gain new insights in cosmology.\n\nMeanwhile, in materials science, researchers have been seeking a stable, cost-effective, and efficient solution for achieving wide color gamut, robust corrosion resistance, UV resistance, and structural coloring for large-scale industrial production. Traditional methods such as ultrafast laser-induced plasma core coloring of metal nanoparticles and ultrafast laser-induced periodic surface structure coloring (LIPSS) face challenges in the form of oxidation, low processing efficiency, and the generation of iridescent colors due to diffraction.\n\nIn a recent study, scientists successfully achieved stable, highly saturated structural colors with excellent angular independence using a simple nanosecond laser double-scan method based on the principle of laser-induced oxide film-induced interference effect coloring. They observed micron-sized periodic structures on the surface of the alloy created by the laser double-scan method, which induce multiple internal reflections, reducing surface reflectivity within the visible light spectrum and ultimately influencing its optical properties.\n\nThis research offers a significant breakthrough in material science, as it provides a cost-effective solution for large-scale information steganography of structural color and anti-counterfeiting applications. The ability to conceal text, QR codes, and images within other images using this technique is an innovative application that has the potential to revolutionize industries such as packaging and security printing.\n\nBoth the Physarum algorithm in cosmology and the laser double-scan method in material science demonstrate how harnessing complexity and creativity can lead to groundbreaking discoveries and solutions to intricate problems within their respective fields. The former offers a more comprehensive understanding of cosmic structures, while the latter enables the production of stable, cost-effective, and widely applicable structural colors for industrial applications. These methods underscore the power of scientific innovation in expanding our knowledge and capabilities.",

One promising area is the development of multi-stimuli-responsive materials, which can respond to various stimuli including heat, acid, and solvents.\n\nRecent advancements include the design and investigation of a polymorphic elasto-plastic Schiff-based crystal with morphology-dependent photomechanical motions. This crystal exhibits dual plasticity and elasto-plasticity along different facets due to slidable separating layers, making it an intriguing material for adaptive applications. Form I of the crystal retains its elastic bending ability even after being plastically twisted, while Form II cannot twist without fractures. Moreover, Form I displays photomechanical motions, including jumping and twisting to bending, by adjusting crystal morphologies in response to ultraviolet light irradiation. Theoretical calculations suggest that lattice deformation induced by photoisomerization of Form I is the driving force for these crystal motions.\n\nHowever, developing efficient methods for collaboration across entities while preserving privacy remains a challenge in material science, especially in the context of federated learning (FL), a machine learning approach used to construct AI models across multiple entities. The limited practical adaptation of FL due to time-consuming conventional privacy-preserving methods and the absence of quantum-computing resistance pose significant hurdles.\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers have proposed a novel vertical federated learning strategy called HQsFL. This method relies on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Matrix Vector Product based on Coefficient Encoding. HQsFL can be applied to various FL algorithms, such as logistic regression and XGBoost, and experimental results demonstrate its utility and efficiency in achieving comparable levels of AUC to conventional methods while significantly improving training efficiency and ensuring quantum-computing resistance.\n\nIn the context of transportation networks, adaptive materials inspired by biological tissues could improve infrastructure's ability to withstand dynamic loads and respond to changing environments. For instance, self-healing concrete that mimics bone tissue could autonomously repair cracks, reducing maintenance costs and increasing structural longevity. Photoresponsive luminescent elastomers emulating adaptive growth and strengthening could be used for creating smart road surfaces with improved traction and durability under varying weather conditions.\n\nIn cybersecurity, blockchain technology ensures secure access to digital data by maintaining authenticity and integrity through decentralized and distributed ledgers. However, there is a need for self-healing cryptographic algorithms that can adapt and recover from attacks in real-time. Researchers are exploring the development of photoresponsive cryptography based on light-sensitive materials, which could modify encryption keys when exposed to specific light conditions, thereby enhancing security by ensuring dynamic and adaptable cryptographic systems.\n\nRecent research in Social Systems Engineering (SSE) reveals that there are parallels between the thermodynamic feedback mechanisms underlying physics, chemistry, and biology and socio-political, legal, and economic domains. The primary objective of SSE is to explore methodologies for engineering and designing institutions grounded in experimentally replicable symmetries and utilizing observable physical metrics that can be iteratively optimized across tradespaces to tap into the increasingly non-local potentials. Mathematical modeling and simulation techniques, adapted from engineering and physics, are employed as a case study to examine the feasibility of applying these methods to the architecture, design, and optimization of socio-technical systems.\n\nIn conclusion, advancements in material science, including multi-stimuli-responsive materials such as the Schiff-based crystal, self-healing concrete, photoresponsive luminescent elastomers, and photoresponsive cryptography, are emulating the adaptive growth and strengthening observed in biological tissues to address challenges in various industries like transportation infrastructure and cybersecurity. Federated learning strategies such as HQsFL are also essential for efficient and privacy-preserving collaboration across entities to develop innovative technologies that can respond to complex environments and evolving threats. The potential applications of SSE in optimizing socio-technical systems further underscore the importance of interdisciplinary research in material science and beyond.",

  "query": "How can we create polymeric systems that enhance durability through repeated mechanical stimuli?",
  "response": " Creating durable polymeric systems that can enhance their properties through mechanical stimuli is crucial for various applications, including wearable technology, information encryption, and robotic grippers. One approach to addressing this challenge involves developing biodegradable fibers with improved mechanical strength, such as sodium alginate-based fibers (1). Pre-crosslinking the sodium alginate solution enhances shear viscosity, leading to better alignment of sodium alginate chains and resulting in multifilaments with superior mechanical properties. Alginate multifilaments exhibit a high breaking strength, elongation at break, Young's modulus, and toughness (1).\n\nAnother strategy for creating durable polymeric systems through mechanical stimuli is using thermoresponsive hydrogels, such as P(HPA-co-AM)/HPC/LiCl hydrogel (2). This hydrogel exhibits excellent thermoresponsiveness due to PHPA and mechanical performance from HPC. LiCl regulates the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the hydrogel. The hydrogel displays high tensile strength, a large maximum strain, and adjustable LCST values.\n\nA novel application of these advanced materials is in the field of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), which is promising for various applications but lacks NIR CPL-active materials with high glum values and spatial-temporal control. Here, a dynamic NIR-CPL was achieved through supramolecular coassembly and energy-transfer strategies using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and a pyrene derivative (3). The introduction of sulfo-cyanine5 led to an energy-transfer process, resulting in NIR CPL with increased glum value. Temporal control was realized by introducing alkaline phosphatase for biomimetic enzyme-catalyzed network fabrication, allowing the dynamic NIR CPL signal to be turned on (3).\n\nBased on these findings, a multilevel information encryption system was further developed using enzyme-regulated temporally controllable dynamic CPL-active chiral assemblies. This study offers a pioneering example for constructing dynamic NIR CPL materials with temporal control via the supramolecular assembly strategy (3).\n\nIn conclusion, developing advanced polymeric systems that can enhance their properties through mechanical stimuli is essential for various applications. Strategies include creating biodegradable fibers with improved mechanical strength using pre-crosslinking and fabricating thermoresponsive hydrogels. The potential of these materials was further demonstrated by achieving dynamic NIR CPL using supramolecular coassembly and energy-transfer strategies, which paves the way for designing complex systems with temporal control that mimic natural biological systems.\n\nReferences:\n[1] (Provided context)\n[2] Liu, X., Zhou, W., Li, H., & Guan, J.

  "query": "What are potential applications for materials that can grow stronger with use, inspired by natural processes?",
  "response": " Materials that grow stronger or exhibit unique properties with use, inspired by natural processes, hold significant potential in various emerging fields, particularly in developing advanced materials and structures. One such example comes from the unique structure of human skin, which exhibits both elasticity and toughness through a gradient microstructure and interlocking collagen fibers. Another inspiration comes from nature's ability to create biodegradable materials with high mechanical strength, like sodium alginate, a biomass polysaccharide.\n\nTraditionally, the limited mechanical strength of alginate fibers has restricted their usage in load-bearing fabrics and reinforcement fibers due to their disentanglement at high stretches. However, recent advancements have led to the preparation of alginate multifilaments using pre-crosslinked sodium alginate solutions. This strategy effectively hinders the disentanglement of sodium alginate chains at high stretches, leading to an increase in shear viscosity and facilitating the high alignment and orientation of sodium alginate chains. The resultant fibers exhibit exceptional properties, including a breaking strength of 474 MPa, elongation at break of 16%, Young's modulus of 14.4 GPa, and toughness of 51.8 MJ/m3.\n\nIn the field of adaptive materials, researchers are designing polymorphic elasto-plastic crystals that display morphology-dependent photomechanical motions. These crystals exhibit dual plasticity and elasto-plasticity along different facets due to slidable separating layers, making them multi-stimuli-responsive. The crystal Form I retains its elastic bending ability even after being plastically twisted, owing to the well-maintained strong π--π interactions, while Form II cannot twist without fractures.\n\nThe photomechanical motions of Form I, including jumping, twisting to bending, are realized by adjusting the crystal morphologies. In contrast, Form II is lacking in response to ultraviolet light irradiation. Theoretical calculation analysis reveals that lattice deformation induced by photoisomerization of Form I is the driving forces for crystal motions. Additionally, reversible luminescence switching behaviors are realized in Form I and Form II upon acid-base fumigation as well as heating.\n\nThese synergistic multi-stimuli-responsive materials based on heat, acid, and solvent stimuli provide an alternative path for multi-mode information encryption. In biomedical engineering, the development of alginate multifilaments could lead to advancements in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications, such as scaffolds for cartilage and bone tissue repair. In energy storage, these materials could be used to create advanced batteries with improved mechanical properties and durability. In environmental sensing, humidity-responsive materials like the PES-PI/PDMS composite surface could be employed in sensors for monitoring temperature and humidity levels. In information encryption applications, responsive luminescent materials based on dynamic interface-anchored borate nanoassemblies could provide a platform for developing self-healable, photoresponsive encryption systems with superior mechanical performances and functional recovery capabilities.",

  "query": "How can engineered hydrogels be designed to mimic the self-repairing capabilities of living organisms?",
  "response": " Engineered hydrogels designed to mimic the self-repairing capabilities of living organisms can be achieved through a combination of strategies inspired by nature and advanced materials science. One approach is to create bilayer gradient hydrogels, which draw inspiration from the unique structure and properties of human skin. This fabrication process involves a synergistic combination of ion diffusion-induced and strong-weak topological crosslinking.\n\nThe initial step employs Zn2+ ions to form weak bonds, imparting elasticity on the gel. Subsequently, Fe3+/Zn2+ diffusion constructs a strong-weak topologically crosslinked network, enhancing the hydrogel's toughness while minimizing brittleness associated with robust bonds. This design offers adaptive energy dissipation strategies for handling both large and small stresses.\n\nMoreover, responsive luminescent materials found in jellyfish provide additional insights for creating self-healable hydrogels. Nanocomposites featuring reversible interfacial bonding between nanoassemblies and the polymer matrix, coupled with their nanoconfinement effect, endow the materials with excellent mechanical performances and superior recovery capacities after damage.\n\nSelf-cleaning surfaces, inspired by nature, are another relevant area of research in material science. These surfaces, found on butterfly wings and lotus leaves, have applications in various industries, including petroleum technologies for separating oil and water. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces are the two primary categories of self-cleaning surfaces, each with distinct advantages.\n\nOn hydrophilic surfaces, water spreads considerably (sheeting of water), enabling the transport of contaminants and leaving a clean surface. In contrast, hydrophobic surfaces are cleaned by the slipping of water droplets on them. The design and selection of self-cleaning surfaces require a thorough understanding of their underlying physical chemistry, which is crucial for industrial applications in petroleum technologies.\n\nIn conclusion, engineered hydrogels can be designed to mimic the self-repairing capabilities of living organisms by employing a combination of strategies inspired by nature and advanced materials science. The fabrication process for bilayer gradient hydrogels provides elasticity, toughness, responsiveness to external stimuli, and programmable design in a single hydrogel system.
